PLAIN-2873	lower levels of the cancer promoting growth hormone igf-1 in those eating vegan is not expected to affect their accumulation of muscle mass .
PLAIN-2874	to maintain the low igf-1 levels associated with a plant-based diet , one should probably eat no more than 3-5 servings of soy foods a day .
PLAIN-2875	vegans consuming 7-18 servings of soy foods a day may end up with circulating igf-1 levels comparable to those who eat meat .
PLAIN-2876	while animal proteins increase levels of the cancer-promoting growth hormone igf-1 , and most plant proteins bring levels down , " high quality " plant proteins such as soy may not significantly affect levels in either direction . this , however , may depend on the quantity consumed .
PLAIN-2877	the reason animal proteins trigger the release of the cancer-promoting growth hormone igf-1 more than plant proteins may be because the relative ratios of amino acids in animal proteins more closely resembles our own .
PLAIN-2878	animal protein consumption triggers the release of the cancer-promoting growth hormone igf-1 .
PLAIN-2881	congenital igf-1 deficiency can lead to laron syndrome ( a type of dwarfism ) , but with such low growth hormone levels those with the condition have dramatically lower cancer rates . this raises the question of whether one can achieve the best of both worlds by ensuring adequate igf-1 levels during childhood while then suppressing excess growth promotion in adulthood .
PLAIN-2882	insulin-like growth factor ( igf-1 ) is a natural human growth hormone instrumental in normal growth during childhood , but in adulthood can promote abnormal growth — the proliferation , spread ( metastasis ) , and invasion of cancer .
PLAIN-2883	all men should consider eating a prostate-healthy diet , which includes legumes ( beans , peas , lentils , soy ) ; certain vegetables ( like garlic and onions ) ; certain seeds ( flax seeds ) ; and the avoidance of refined grains , eggs , and poultry .

PLAIN-2897	when asked whether food and beverage consumption or physical activity was more important , the majority of people get the answer wrong .
PLAIN-2898	the water content of plant foods may help explain why those eating plant-based diets are , on average , so slim . can ice be thought of as having even " fewer " calories than water since the body has to warm it up ?
PLAIN-2901	the good bacteria in our gut can digest the fiber we eat and turn it into an anti-obesity compound called propionate that we absorb back into our system .
PLAIN-2902	flavonoid phytonutrients ( found concentrated in citrus , berries , red onions , beans , green tea , grapes , and cocoa ) may boost metabolism enough to significantly slim one 's waistline .
PLAIN-2903	the arginine content of nuts may explain their metabolism boosting effects , though in a list of the top food sources of arginine , nuts don 't even make the top ten .
PLAIN-2904	finally there ’ s a solution to the mystery of why nuts don 't seem to make people gain weight . it appears to be a combination of factors including a boost to our metabolism , which results in us burning more of our own fat stores .
PLAIN-2905	an elegant study is presented testing the appetite-suppressing effects of walnuts .
PLAIN-2906	if the fecal fat losses associated with undigested pieces of nuts ( due to inadequate chewing ) and the tedium of shelling them in the first place helps account for why nuts don 't tend to lead to weight gain , then studies on nut butters would presumably turn out differently .
PLAIN-2907	a few theories have been proposed as to why nuts don 't appear to contribute to weight gain , including the " pistachio principle " and the fecal excretion theory .
PLAIN-2908	nut consumption does not appear to lead to the expected weight gain .

PLAIN-2915	a dramatic difference exists between the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of black walnuts versus english walnuts .
PLAIN-2916	cooking oil manufacturer " best-by " dates are put to the test by comparing the development of rancidity between almond oil , avocado oil , hazelnut oil , macadamia oil , grape seed oil , rice bran oil , toasted sesame oil , and walnut oil .
PLAIN-2917	the secret to naturally boosting serotonin levels in the brain may include eating foods such as pumpkin seeds with a high tryptophan to total protein ratio . this may help explain why studies show that those eating plant-based diets have superior mood states .
PLAIN-2918	contrary to popular belief , the consumption of animal foods may actually decrease tryptophan levels in the brain . carbohydrates , on the other hand , can boost transport across the blood-brain barrier , which has been used to explain premenstrual cravings .
PLAIN-2921	despite promising autopsy and population data suggesting that inadequate magnesium intake is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death , it wasn 't until recently that this was demonstrated in prospective studies .
PLAIN-2922	most men and women who die of heart disease , our # 1 killer , die suddenly without any known history of heart problems . nut consumption , however , has been associated specifically with decreased risk of sudden cardiac death , which may be due to magnesium , a mineral found predominantly in whole grains , greens , beans , nuts and seeds .
PLAIN-2923	iron is a double-edged sword . if we don 't absorb enough , we risk anemia , but if absorb too much we may increase our risk of cancer , heart disease , and a number of inflammatory conditions . because the human body has no mechanism to rid itself of excess iron , one should choose plant-based ( non-heme ) sources over which our body has some control .
PLAIN-2924	the whole grain phytonutrient , phytic acid ( phytate ) , partially inhibits mineral absorption , but has a wide-range of health-promoting properties such as anti-cancer activity . by concurrently eating mineral absorption enhancers such as garlic and onions one can get the best of both worlds by improving the bioavailability of iron and zinc in plant foods .
PLAIN-2925	one mechanism by which caloric restriction may extend one 's lifespan is by upregulating dehydroepiandrosterone ( dhea ) , the most abundant steroid hormone in the human body . dhea supplements are discouraged , but there may be a natural way to conserve levels as we age .
