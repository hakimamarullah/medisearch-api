PLAIN-1	why deep fried foods may cause cancer in the latest study on dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women , healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds . included in the unhealthy eating pattern was the consumption of deep-fried foods , which have previously been linked to breast cancer , pancreatic cancer , lung cancer , oral and throat cancers , esophageal cancer , and cancer of the voicebox . no deep fried foods ? what ’ s a southern belle to do ? instead of deep fried foods , how about the traditional southern diet , characterized by high intakes of cooked greens , beans , legumes , cabbage , sweet potatoes and cornbread , which may reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer significantly . what about the consumption of deep-fried foods and risk of prostate cancer ? researchers at the fred hutchinson cancer research center and the university of washington found that eating french fries , fried chicken , fried fish , and doughnuts was associated with about a third greater odds of prostate cancer . after stratifying for tumor aggressiveness , they found slightly stronger associations with more aggressive disease , suggesting that regular intake of deep-fried foods may contribute to the progression of prostate cancer as well . what in deep fried foods is so bad for us ? just heating oil that hot can generate potentially carcinogenic compounds , and then known carcinogens such as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons form when the muscles of chickens and fish are cooked at that temperature . deep-fried plants , on the other hand , can form acrylamide . i did a video about acrylamide back in 2008 , suggesting it ’ s a probable human carcinogen ( see acrylamide in french fries ) . since then , studies have suggested pregnant women may want to cut back on french fries to protect the growth of their baby ’ s body and brain . based on a study ( highlighted in my video , cancer risk from french fries ) feeding people a little bag of potato chips every day for a month , it now seems acrylamide may also cause inflammation as well , which could explain its purported role in cancer progression . acrylamide intake has been associated with endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , lung cancer , kidney cancer , and esophageal cancer . how much cancer risk are we talking about ? taiwanese researchers examined lifetime cancer risk and french fry consumption . the researchers picked on french fries because they comprise by far the greatest percentage contribution of acrylamide to the diets of children . they estimated that , at most , one or two boys and girls out of every ten thousand would develop cancer eating french fries that they would otherwise not have developed if they hadn ’ t eaten french fries . so it ’ s not as bad as eating something like fried fish , or fried chicken , but how much is that saying ? the level of cancer risk in both boys and girls associated with french fries depends on how long and hot they ’ re fried . in europe , the food industry swore that they ’ d self-regulate and control fry times to decrease acrylamide levels , but we ’ ve yet to see any subsequent change in acrylamide levels in french fries . researchers continue to urge that the cooking temperature should be as low as possible and the cooking time should be as short as possible , “ while still maintaining a tasty quality ” of course . we wouldn ’ t want to reduce cancer risk too much — they might not taste as good ! blanching the potatoes first reduces acrylamide formation , but potato chip companies complain that , not only would it muck with the flavor , but it would reduce the nutritional properties by leaching away some of the vitamin c. but if we ’ re relying on potato chips to get our vitamin c , acrylamide is probably the least of our worries . more on heterocyclic amines : there are some things we can do to counteract the effects of these carcinogens , though : i touch on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in meat fumes : dietary secondhand smoke and is liquid smoke flavoring carcinogenic ? certain fats may play a role in breast cancer survival as well : breast cancer survival , butterfat , and chicken and breast cancer survival and trans fat . even before the oil gets in the fryer , it ’ s been heavily damaged by the refining process . the multi-step process to take a whole food seed to a refined oil leaves behind oxidized , reactive fatty acids and chemical residues.does this refining process oxidize vegan dha pills , making these fats harmful ? i hope not . great question ! of the well known dietary fatty acids , dha has the highest peroxidation index . do the manufactures add an antioxidant to their dha products ? agreed , great question ! it may be more of a question for the manufacturer . we do know that dha oil from algae appear effective . another study here.yes , but does the dha vegan supplement also provide epa , or just dha ? this is important , no ? i ’ ve seen most vegan dha supplements make no mention of the product containing epa . fish oil has both . maybe you can clear this up for me , i assume i am missing something here in the understanding.leslie : i ’ ve seen quite a few commercial , algea-based omega three pills which include both dha and epa . here ’ s just one example ( not one i ’ m promoting . just the first one that popped up in a random search ) : http : / / www.devanutrition.com / vegan-dha-epa-delayed-release-omega-3.htmli ’ m sure there are also pills with just the dha , but i don ’ t think it is hard to find ones with the epa too if that ’ s what you want.how is it that some algae provide both dha and epa , and others do not ? i figured that algae in itself always contained both the dha and epa , as fish oil contains both dha and epa and the fish get it from eating algae . but some vegan companies say just dha . hmmmm … .leslie : i had assumed that the difference between different pill claims was due to different processing techniques . but you could be right . it could be that the pills which only claim to have dha are simply not reporting the epa ? i really have no clue.hi leslie : most algal dha supplements contain only dha . increasingly though there ’ re products with both dha and epa . if you type in “ vegan omega-3 ″ on amazon , you can find them , but they are even more expensive than algal dha-only products . it ’ s , of course , good to take both dha and epa but not essential because dha and epa equilibrate in the body : if you took only dha , some of it would be converted to epa , and vice versa.i find it thought provoking that the fish oil companies are shifting to balancing their dha epa supplement to contain more epa than dha , as a greater amount of epa than dha in the body has been found to be more effective for mood issues , as well as some feel other issues as well . vegans may be compromising themselves by taking dha only … .creating a level of dha and epa that might adversely effect them.http : / / www.nutraingredients-usa.com / research / epa-stands-alone-as-a-depression-fighterhttps : / / labdoor.com / article / epa-to-dha-ratio-a-benefits-and-risks-analysisseems like a good question for one of the manufacturers like nordic.from the study you linked tohttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23651876 dietary patterns and breast cancer risk among women . “ the ‘ healthy ’ food pattern was characterized by the consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains ; while the ‘ unhealthy ’ food pattern was characterized by the consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea and coffee , french fries and potato chips , salt , sweets and desserts , hydrogenated fats , nuts , industrial juice , refined grains , and red and processed meat . ” so – the “ healthy food pattern ” included low fat dairy , olive and vegetable oils , organ meat and poultry ” ! ! and excluded tea ! ? ! this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit ‘ healthy ’ pattern and a best fit ‘ unhealthy ’ pattern — really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is ‘ a-type ’ variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is ‘ b-type ’ variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them ‘ healthy ’ and ‘ unhealthy ’ but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called ‘ traditional / rural ’ and ‘ urban / industrial ’ . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea ’ s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn ’ t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger ’ s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn ’ t all that great.this is what dr greger said – “ healthier eating was associated with eliminating three-quarters of the odds of breast cancer , whereas less healthy eating was associated with up to nearly eight times the odds ” again – the healthier eating pattern included vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy products , legumes , olive and vegetable oils , fish , condiments , organ meat , poultry , pickles , soya and whole grains.no matter how you want to spin it you can ’ t.however it would be useful if the good doctor would post a link to the entire study not just the abstract.the study is freely accessible , charles , and can be reached from the source link to the publisher on greger ’ s pubmed citation . greger is quoting his results from table 3 , model ii . i should mention that i misspoke a bit in calling these models ‘ univariate ’ . they focus on only one pattern at a time as the independent variable of interest , but their other statistical controls such as age , menopausal status , etc , are independent variables also . note that i haven ’ t said anything about the quality of greger ’ s reporting on the study yet , either . given that your op talked about the study and not what greger said , i assumed we were talking about what the study itself means.read the study and try to comprehend what i wrote as something other than ‘ spin ’ , then i might get back to you . i assure you that they found two patterns which spanned about 24-31 % of dietary variation in the population , then asked how healthy those patterns actually were . they did not ask up front “ what is the pattern whose variation explains the greatest variation in health outcomes ? ” . the latter form of questioning is well-framed to get you a list that distinguishes apparently healthy foods from apparently unhealthy , while the former is not.this study exemplifies the importance of the ability to read the study and understand the statistical method in order to interpret the study correctly . they did what is known as principal component analysis ( https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / principal _ component _ analysis ) as their factor analytic technique . the goal was dimension reduction prior to statistical analysis , not a direct inference of a best-fit ‘ healthy ’ pattern and a best fit ‘ unhealthy ’ pattern — really this would make no sense for a two-factor model since the unhealthiest pattern would be simply the negative of the healthiest pattern and there would only be one factor.the correct interpretation of their statistics is that : 1 ) they first found two orthogonal factors which varied significantly in their sample . that is , there is ‘ a-type ’ variation in which consumption of vegetables , fruits , low-fat dairy , etc , all increase together , and some of the other dietary components decrease . then there is ‘ b-type ’ variation in which consumption of soft drinks , sugars , tea , etc all increase together , and some other dietary components decrease . the sample diets from the ffq varied from person to person a fair bit in both the a-way and the b-way . the study calls them ‘ healthy ’ and ‘ unhealthy ’ but based on the characteristics given they could also plausibly be called ‘ traditional / rural ’ and ‘ urban / industrial ’ . 2 ) in a model that looked at both a-ness and b-ness of diets as independent variables , a-ness was found to associate with higher breast cancer risk while b-ness was found to associate with lower risk . if you had to pick between a-ness and b-ness as the only ways in which you could vary your diet to protect yourself from breast cancer , your best bet would be to reduce b and increase a. that said , a and b cannot be interpreted simply as straightforward lists of healthy / unhealthy things . in fact there are very obvious reasons why tea consumption would tend to increase along with all the other refined and processed foods , that have nothing to do with tea ’ s health per se . there are also obvious reasons why organ meats might be more common among people with greater access to other fresh and traditional foods , that have nothing to do with the health of organ meats per se.if you had to ask me the study is valuable but it doesn ’ t do much to pinpoint exactly what is good or bad for breast cancer . we rely on other research in order to interpret what the healthiest dietary pattern for preventing breast cancer might be . note that in greger ’ s article the study in question is only introduced as the latest , not the greatest . in many respects , the study isn ’ t all that great.a litttle more nuancing might help . i obtain lots of vegetable from my grocery garden , wich i store in my freezer for winter time , after boiling it for a short minute . i may hope that that is not so bad ! as i understand , boiling in water and steaming don ’ t cause acrylamide formation . it ’ s the burning of plant foods due to dry heating that leads to acrylamide.thanks ! the issue for me with fat supplementation is this ; many many people arer taking all kinds of omega ’ s , olive , primrose oils etc . can we clarify the research as to how they oxidize and cause damage ? they layman really has no idea on how to proceed and not create chaos with the oils they take . now dr peter glidden is against all oils for the most part . i think he makes an exception for youngevity efa and maybe coconut oils . any help to clarify would go a long way.great point , anthony . a guest below also had a comment about oxidation . maybe this can be another nutritionfacts research fund project ? dr. greger has a video about the true shelf life of cooking oils . it would be nice to see more on the oils you mention.so would fried coconut oil be safe , and organic potato chips fried in just organic coconut oil not be an issue / problem , as far as arrylamide content as well as oxidation , inflammation ? wondering what you think about this . i have no idea.is it safe to bake potatoes , etc. in the oven brushed with a little olive oil ? what is the temperature at which acrylamide formation becomes a concern ? hi jan . here is a video about the best way to cook sweet potatoes . it ’ s really the french fries ( deep frying ) that is problematic , as they are laden with acrylamide . here is a study looking at acrylamide and temperature . this study mentions how cooking time and temperature may determine acrylamide levels.i watched that video & i like the fact that dr. greger won ’ t compromise quantity of good food vs. quality .. he mentions that best way of eating such a healthy food as sweet potato is how you get most of it .. therefore if someone doesn ’ t have time or facility to boil , they don ’ t have to stop eating it ! one can bake & eat more of it to get same nutrients . that obviously doesn ’ t apply to french fries , but reminds me about some schools or work places , which only provide students / employees with french fries & no better alternative . here the challenge is either eat the deep fried potatoes or stay hungry .. this is a much more difficult decision to make , and for me as an advocate for public health is an example of how important is infrastructure changes to have healthier nation.good information . i will be sharing the informationi will be lurking around the net trying to find out about the dangers of oxidation of oils . if anyone else finds anything please post.beast carcinogen indeedhow about air popped popcorn ? hot temperature ? starch ? short cooking time ? sounds like a recipe for acrylamide . i would be bummed … i love my air popped popcorn. acrylamide , beans , breast cancer , cabbage , cancer , cancer survival , carcinogens , chicken , children , cooking methods , doughnuts , endometrial cancer , endometrial health , esophageal cancer , esophageal health , europe , fish , french fries , frying , greens , heterocyclic amines , industry influence , inflammation , kidney cancer , legumes , lung cancer , men 's health , oils , oral cancer , ovarian cancer , pancreatic cancer , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , potato chips , poultry , prostate cancer , sweet potatoes , throat cancer , turkey , vitamin c , women 's health - -

PLAIN-101	how to treat multiple sclerosis with diet multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and frightening degenerative autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which our body attacks our own nerves . it often strikes in the prime of life and can cause symptoms in the brain , such as cognitive impairment ; in the eye , such as painful loss of vision ; as well as tremors , weakness , loss of bladder control , pain , and fatigue . the most frequently prescribed drug for multiple sclerosis is interferon beta , which can make one feel lousy and cost $ 30,000 a year . but hey , it might be worthwhile — if it actually worked . we learned recently that it doesn ’ t seem to prevent or delay long-term disability . that leaves chemo drugs like mitoxantrone that causes irreversible heart damage in one out of every eight people who go on the drug and causes cancer ( leukemia ) in nearly 1 % of people who take it . but ms is no walk in the park either . if only there was a cheap , simple , safe , side-effect free solution that also just so happened to be the most effective treatment for ms ever prescribed … dr. roy swank , who we lost recently at age 99 , was a distinguished neurologist whose research culminated in over 170 scientific papers . in the video , treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet , i highlight a few . as far back as 1950 , we knew there were areas in the world that had a lot of ms — north america , europe — and other places — africa and asia — that hardly had any . and migration studies show that those who move from a high risk area to a low risk area significantly drop their risk , and vice versa . so it seems less genetic and more lifestyle . dr. swank had an idea . as he recounts in an interview with dr. john mcdougall at the ripe young age of 84 , “ it seemed possible to me that this could be a matter of food , because the further north you go the less vegetarian a life is led and the more people are carnivores , you might say — they spend a lot more time eating meat . ” after looking at the multiple sclerosis data from world war ii in occupied countries where meat and dairy were rationed , along with his famous study in ’ 52 that found that the frequency of ms related directly to the amount of saturated animal fat consumed daily in different areas of norway , he concluded that it might be the animal fat that was causing the increased risk . he decided to put it to the test by restricting people ’ s intake of saturated animal fat , most commonly coming from dairy and chicken in the u.s. ( see trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero ) . in treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet , you can see data on his first 47 patients before cutting out about 90 % of the saturated fat from their diet and after , showing a decrease in both the frequency and severity of ms attacks . normally , we ’ re lucky if we can get people to stick to a diet for six months , and so that ’ s why most dietary trials last a year at the most . the first study he published reported results from the first three and a half years . then came the five and a half year follow-up in which he added about another 100 patients . then the seven year follow-up , published in the annals of internal medicine . then the 20 year follow-up , and then the 34 year follow-up . how did his patients do ? if we can get to people early in their disease , when they ’ re only mildly disabled , and restrict their saturated fat intake , dr. swank showed he could stop their disease in 95 % of cases — no further disability 34 years later . but if they started slacking on their diet — even years in , their disease could become reactivated . they felt so great that some felt that they could cheat a little bit , since they had their disease so well under control . but eating just eight grams of saturated fat more a day was accompanied by a striking increase in disability and a near tripling of their death rate . how about a 50 year follow-up ! they were able to track down 15 of the original patients that stuck to the diet , now in their 70s and 80s , with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years , and 13 out of 15 were walking around normal in all respects . conclusion : “ this study indicated that , in all probability , ms is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat . ” dr. swank thought it was the sludging of the blood caused by even a single meal of saturated fats that can clog tiny capillaries that feed our nervous system . diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol can thicken the blood and make our red cells sticky . a single meal of sausage and eggs can stick our blood cells together like rolls of quarters . and that kind of hyperaggregation can lead to a reduction of blood flow and oxygenation of our tissues . what ’ s in sausage and eggs that may cause so much inflammation ? see my video series on endotoxins described in my blog how does meat cause inflammation ? if we put someone ’ s blood through a machine that sucks out about 90 % of the cholesterol in their blood , we can demonstrate an immediate improvement in microcirculation in the heart muscle . but what about the brain ? the eyes are the windows … to our brain . we can visualize — in real-time — changes in blood vessel function in the retina at the back of the eye , which gives us a sense of what ’ s happening further back in the brain . and if we lower the cholesterol level in the blood , we can immediately get a significant improvement in vasodilation — the little veins open wider and let the blood flow . so yes , it could be the animal fat leading to clogging of our capillaries , but now we know animal fats can have all sorts of other deleterious effects such as inflammation , so who knows what the actual mechanism may be by which cutting animal fat can cut ms progression . regardless , patients with ms that follow a diet with no more than 10 or 15 grams of saturated fat can expect to survive and thrive to a ripe old age . of course , cutting out saturated fat completely might be better , given that heart disease is our number one killer . the bottom line is that the results dr. swank published remain “ the most effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer reviewed medical literature . ” in patients with early stage ms , 95 % were without progression of their disease 34 years later after adopting his low saturated fat dietary program . even patients with initially advanced disease showed significant benefit . to date , no medication or invasive procedure has ever even come close , to demonstrating such success . doesn ’ t cost $ 30,000 dollars ; doesn ’ t give you leukemia — and works . better ! this all begs one big obvious question : if dr. swanks results are “ so stunningly impressive , why haven ’ t other physicians , neurologists , and centers adopted this method of treatment ? ” one reason may be that mri machines weren ’ t invented until the 1970s , decades after dr. swank ’ s study began . mris are how we track the progress of ms today . we don ’ t have to rely on patients ’ subjective reports or doctor ’ s clinical judgments , we can see the disease get better or worse right there in black and white . it ’ s like in the 1970s when nathan pritikin appeared to reverse heart disease by the thousands but no one took him seriously until angiography was invented and the likes of ornish and esselstyn ( see our number one killer can be stopped ) could hold up angiographic images , proving conclusively that a plant-based diet could help literally open up arteries . so what we need is someone to repeat swank ’ s experiment today with mri scans every step of the way . and i ’ m happy to report that exact experiment was just completed by dr. john mcdougall . dr. swank was one of dr. mcdougall ’ s heroes , and dr. mcdougall is one of mine . study enrollment was completed last year and we should have the full results soon . i touched on this in my live 2013 year-in-review lecture more than an apple a day , but i ’ m excited to be able to take a deeper dive into this extraordinary story . those interested in supporting dr. mcdougall ’ s landmark study ( headed by dr. dennis bourdette , m.d. and under the supervision of dr. vijayshree yadav ) can donate to his nonprofit mcdougall research & education foundation ( you can also donate to nutritionfacts.org to help keep us bringing you similarly underreported yet life-saving science ) . this is exciting information for those with ms. i am wondering , however , if there is any recent information that would help those with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis . i understand there is currently a study program in place testing a product called pirfinidone . if you have any information on this or any other study , including , of course , diet , that would benefit those with ipf , it would be greatly appreciated since few people with ipf survive longer than eight years , and someone very near and dear to me is struggling with this condition.systemic enzymes are fantastic for lysing any type of fibrosis in the body . they are taken on an empty stomach so they can be absorbed. http : / / www.totalityofbeing.com / framelesspages / articles / copdandpulmonaryfibrosis.htmthank you for this information . i will definitely look into it.the reason for the lack of interest by both the public and medical profession could be that diet is not considered relevant to ms. outside heartburn and allergies , diet is still a fringe treatment to most medical professionals , who use sound bytes rather than research to determine what to prescribe . the research here is clear and the sound bytes override it , to the detriment of all but the most intelligent public who read nutritionfacts.org.someone needs to do a study on essential tremor like these ms studies . i ’ ve been using a whole-food , plant-based diet for years to manage et and believe it is not progressing . if we can stop the progression of et with diet , it would help tens of millions of people . please , some of you clinical nutritionists , put some of your et patients on a plant-based diet and lets find out if it stops the progression . the typical et patient gets 10 % worse tremor symptoms each year . it should be easy after a few years to tell if the diet is effective.dr. terry wahls cured her severe ms with a paleo diet . nine cups of fruits and vegetables per day , no dairy , no gluten and clean living.i was granted my medical doctorate with honor with the work i did on ms. 1 / the target is oligodendrocyte , the cell producing myeline , and wrapping more than 1 axon , protecting the neuron and the neuro-transmission . it is a disease reversible starting in blood , entering the blood brain barrier through an inflammatory reaction from may different origins , 2 / creating an inflammatory reaction before destroying an oligodendrocyte which is the key point of reversibility . when you understand this first step , you start to eat organic , to have 60 % or more in vegetables to get enough antioxydant , to have good fat as avocados to be sure to maintain a balance without reaction . the japanese people living japanese style have no ms , it is not genetic , they have ms when in europe or the us , nutrition looks as the key . the work i did between 1974 to 1985 has inspired more work , all scientific data and lifestyle changes are consistent with a response by the brain cells to an agent brought from the blood from nutriments.great work , thanks . is there also a link between diet and motor neuron disease ? i ’ ve read something about a role for the myelin sheath in that disease too.yes , i did a very extensive work on japanese diet and neurology . all concerning the myelin look better when having a rich anti oxidant food , virgin cold pressed fat oil , no addition of sugar and twice or more portion of fish a week. to say it in simple word , neuro transmission , moto neurons included needs to have active signal , nothing must interfere , simple and rich food as japanese , or real mediterranean are protecting the neuro transmission bringing the elements needed without shutting down the signals , we need phospholipids , clean onesare omega 3s from flax seeds ok instead of fish ? just i did not answer your question , excuse me , i was with the nutrition . oligodendrocytes are the cells making the myelin sheath in a sort of knitting / woven work . i worked on the interaction of the cells to build this sheath around the axon and protect the conduction and the neurotransmission . each part of axon is wrapped by different pieces coming from different cells as if one is damaged the portion of neuron is protected by an other one coming from another cell , security is in place . the ms is the destruction of this myelin sheath , there are phase of inflammation , that makes neuro signs reversible and phase of destruction and then it is scares , we have less chance to reverse , whatever the plasticity of the brain cells , oligodendrocytes included can do migration to repair the damaged portioni had carbon monoxide poisoning at 1 1 / 2 years of age which led me with lesions in my brain … at age 69 i have symptoms of ms and veggies and eating well really helps , i had symptoms all along , tiredness , tingling , numbness , incontinence , etc and never made the connection to co2 poisoning … even though i have these problems i am relieved to know it was probably caused by an accident at an early age … i deal better this way .. before it was just fear if unknown.an accident as you had may be responsible of the signs you describe . i was ordering water gym , to my patients having an acute accident to avoid progressive worsening due to pain when moving. at 69 you know how to deal with it and limit the discomfort.and what about dr. terry wahls , who reversed her secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis with a micronutrient-dense diet and paleo principles ? according to her , some meat , some animal saturated fats , eggs are essential for treating ms with diet : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = f2ya3qpddlm ( dr. terry wahls ’ protocol that reversed multiple sclerosis ) i was wondering the same thing … i ’ m reading dr wahls book now and she emphasises the importance of incorporating grass fed meat and wild fish etc in one ’ s daily diet … so which is best follow ? meat or no meat ? dr. wahl ’ s diet as listed below , is incredibly nutrient dense * despite * the inclusion of animal foods.from my limited reading ( i have not read her book ) , she seems to emphasize omega-3s , which is perhaps why she is endorsing “ grass-fed ” meat or certain fish . why she doesn ’ t use plant-based sources for omega-3s is unclear . perhaps because she was already inclined towards eating a paleo diet ( during which she continued to decline ) before starting the vegetable-heavy nutrient dense regime described below ( as a result of which she improved ) . perhaps this paleo inclination has resulted in an aversion to flax or chia seeds , or perhaps she feels she requires long chain omega-3s , though she could of course consume this in the form of algae.i suspect that being off all grains and potatoes , she requires something calorically dense to simply survive and function , and has found that in low micronutrient but high calorie animal foods.in any case , with all of the veggies she eats per day , the room left for animal foods is scant . i can ’ t imagine her eating a large amount of animal foods on top of all of those veggies.so on one hand , we have multiple , highly reproducible studies showing a high plant food low saturated fat diet works for ms. on the other hand , we have an n = 1 anecdotal tale about someone who eats an obviously high plant food diet and has also corrected her ms. depending on the amount of animal foods she consumes , there may or may not be very much significant disagreement here . it would be interesting to know her saturated fat intake . perhaps it is lower than people are inferring from her dietary description , or perhaps it is higher than those on the swank diet , but her 9 cups of veggies per day are also higher than those on the swank diet , and are providing a therapeutic effect to mitigate the effect of the fats . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ dr. wahl ’ s diet : 3 cups of cruciferous and dark greens3 cups intensely coloured : 1 cup red vegetables / fruit , 1 cup blue black vegetables / fruits , 1 cup yellow / orange vegetable / fruits3 cups others including : 1 cup mushrooms / onion family ( for organic sulphur ) , and seaweed for iodine and trace minerals.include spices and herbs.omega 3 rich foods , green leaves and animals fed green leaves , wild fish and seafood . and you could add fish oil.eat organ meats once per weekregular bone brothfermented foods or a probioticb00mer : you hit the points i wanted to make , but you did so a lot more robustly and elegantly than i would have . i was going to compare to the “ mediterranean diet ” and quote ( to the best of my memory ) jeff novick : “ were they healthy * because * of the olive oil or * inspite * of it ? ” without clinical trials on dr. wahl ’ s diet , we have to use common sense to determine which parts ( or all ) of her diet were likely the cause of her personal , anecdotal success.thanks for your post.thanks thea . i had jeff novick ’ s quotation in my mind as well . funny how people love to pick out the single least significant and least healthful food out of an overall healthy diet to glorify e.g. olive oil or goat cheese with the mediterraneans , fish with the japanese , etc.i could only stand to watch about half of the video as it was achingly unscientific , but the word i heard a million times was micronutrients micronutrients micronutrients . what exactly does micronutrient intake have to do with eating meat ? nothing , unless you ’ re trying to minimize it.she also flippantly mentions “ the essential fats are important too ” , specifically mentioning saturated fat , which of course is nonessential . and in the same breath attempts to relate it to plasma membrane fluidity , which is inversely related to saturated fat composition.it is astounding that someone that displays ignorance about such extremely basic biochem and nutrition principles is given a platform to speak about diet and health . of course , if her message of micronutrients and essential fas is getting cleverly construed to = > eat meat and saturated fat and be healthy , well , i ’ m sure she ’ ll sell a lot of books.b00mer : you gave me my laugh for the day . : - ) thanks for that additional analysis / info . wow . wow . wow . reminds me of jon stewart ’ s responses to certain politicians and our media . painful , but it ’ s better to laugh than cry.dr. wahls ’ experience is not anecdotal or based on one person . she has been doing clinical trials on patients with her diet for the last year . and thousands of people are using her diet plan with amazing success . just visit her facebook page . the brain uses fat for fuel , not glucose . i like everything about this site except its obvious vegan fanaticism.ehm … the first fuel for brain is glucose , and if there are problems with glucose supply then body starts to use ketones body from fat catabolism … http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / human _ brain # metabolismif fat are really primary sources for the brain why does gluconeogenesis exists ? i found a review that could answer some question about the brain preference for glucose instead of atty acids : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23921897in another review the authors talk about the brain areas that regulate glucose homeostasis : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23913677or this text : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / books / nbk22436 / or another : http : / / books.google.it / books ? id = bpoeqasaploc & printsec = frontcover & dq = glucose + and + the + brain & hl = it & sa = x & ei = rd73u8 _ rd-zo7aaylyhyba & ved = 0cceq6aewaa # v = onepage & q & f = falsei think it covers pretty much every brain metabolism … of course it could be more difficult than that : http : / / www.nature.com / jcbfm / journal / v23 / n6 / abs / 9591414a.htmlto me , glucose is of primary importance , then cames the other substrates … there are no articles linked to on her facebook page.on her personal website , she lists only three articles , * none * of which examine the role of fat in treatment of ms : – one article has no dietary intervention component whatsoever . – the other two articles examine up to five other physical , exercise , and lifestyle related interventions in conjuction with dietary interventions including up to 17 supplements and huge amounts of nutrient dense green and sulfur containing vegetables . again , there is no evidence presented to suggest that her patients are in fact consuming large amounts of saturated fat.compare these * two * multifactoral , small ( literally one was n = 1 ) , uncontrolled , short-term studies with the longest running , most successful study on ms in the history of medical literature , which * specifically studies * dietary saturated fat and its effect on ms.there is no comparison between the work of swank and wahls.if you or others purchase her books and see personal progress , that is interesting , but anecdotal.if she ’ s got a study in the works that she can 1 ) actually get published , that would 2 ) actually validate what she says about fat , then i ’ ll be interested to read it.but this website is based on modern science and what that means is peer reviewed literature , not anecdotes and hearsay . you could even say we ’ re fanatical about that . until dr. wahls actually publishes * any * literature showing that fat is beneficial for ms patients , there really isn ’ t any valid scientific conversation to be had about it.the articles she lists on her website study the following : 1. neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( nmes ) and physical therapy improves gait2. a case study of one woman using physical therapy , home exercise and stretching , nmes , and a diet of 600 grams of cruciferous vegetables , 300 grams of brightly colored fruits or vegetables , 60 to 100 grams of meat , poultry or fish , 4 supplements , and no milk , eggs , or gluten . the patient specifically mentions in her own words that it is when she fails to consume the cruciferous vegetables , she experiences a decline in energy and mental focus.3. the effect of stretching , strength exercise , meditation , massage , electrical stimulation , and a “ modified paleolithic ” diet ( specifically encouraging green and sulfur containing vegetables as well as 17 supplements ) on fatigue – in the author ’ s own words , it was a small , uncontrolled pilot study , and their only conclusions were that it improved fatigue and that people followed the plan relatively well.as far back as the 1980s when i was a practicing natural nutritionist , mds would recommend their patients see me for nutrition counseling , since dietitians were still interested in processed , packaged , ‘ industrial strength ’ edibles . long story short : numerous ms patients regained health even to the point of getting off disability and going back to work . diet is the key biochemical factor in health and wellness , which allopathic medicine still cannot seem to accept since it is steeped in chemical medicine , i.e. , toxic pharmaceuticals , which , in many diseases , only exacerbates the problem . the human organism was designed to function with high quality nutrients found in plant-based and some animal foods , as humans have ingested since time immemorial . only within the last century have laboratory-made – mostly petrochemical-based – pharmaceuticals displaced healing foods and modalities . nutrition was called quackery in the 1980s by those in the medical profession who thought they knew it all . i can remember an md , who was head of a hospital , asking me , “ don ’ t you think if there was something to nutrition , we ’ d know about it ? ” dr. greger ’ s work is a breath of fresh air and i compliment him and his team to the highest . my only hope is that the medical profession in its entirety expand their collective consciousness so as to include natural nutrition – not food processing industry nutrition – in med schools and throughout ancillary medical professions.you are right , when i reversed ms by diet on few hundreds patients , i heard all stupid arguments from my colleagues , being the only md in a department of neurology who was not prescribing sleeping pills and having my patients sleeping well . when the tension was too intense i changed my clinical research subject from ms to vascular to explore the bbb and then i was granted american patent for a rescue blood pump i am launching now . i want to be back to nutrition and neurodegenerative disease because i have enough data to know that something is possible to be done with the younger generation . eating is the fuel of life , i do not get why so may people are blind about that.doctors believe that i have 2nd progressive ms. i have been eating as vegan for 6 months . are you saying that i should eat salmon twice a week ? the diet as preventive medicine is a life long diet . twice wild fish a week as cold water cod , herring , salmon , salmon roe once a week these with a organic vegetarian diet may help you to prevent ms to worsen , i described signs of lymphocytes 1 week before relapse , then the 2nd step was to give antioxydants when these signs started for 3 weeks , i observed relapses 2 weeks after the ending the antioxydant treatment . in progressive ms , it is a mixture of chronic inflammatory response , worsening of scares and reactivation of old lesion . i like turmeric and ginger as anti-inflammatory nutriments , most of my patients with progressive ms felt improved adding that to their diet , salmon with ginger green tea rice which is a simple recipe , very japanese looks helping . gaba rice of course.can you eat flax or hemp seeds instead of fish to stay vegan ? yes you can and have seaweeds salads and soups tooi like hemp seed but i have no scientific evaluation . i just use it for me when i am very busy , i had a serious chronic disease , my diet works better than prescription.i have taken your advice regarding turmeric , ginger , and last night i made the ginger green tea gaba rice with a small piece of wild alaskan salmon with the skin on . i have to admit ; i am already walking better , and will continue to have the salmon twice a week for a few months , and see how i do . i am a little concerned about pcb ’ s though . thank you ! there is nothing special in salmon and other fish that isn ’ t found in in a better form in plant foods . however , seafood contains iodine , which is deficient in land based foods due to modern intensive farming practices stripping the soil . the abundance of flourine and chlorine in the modern world also displaces iodine from the body , so we need much more of it today . iodine is essential for the production of a thyroid hormone that is involved in the methylation process , which in in turn creates the methylcobalamin needed to build the myelin sheaths , the fatty protective layer around nerves which break down in people with ms.you would have had better results from consuming kombu / kelp , and would have avoided the cholesterol and saturated fats in the fish . you would have even better results adding drops of lugol ’ s iodine into a smoothie while taking a methylselenocysteine supplement ( selenium is essential for displacing halogens bound into iodine receptors . also if you take iodine while selenium deficient it will exacerbate that deficiency and affect your thyroid ) .take an algal supplement for omega 3s ( which are superior to fish supplements ) and / or consume 7g of flax , 20g of hemp or 4 walnuts . also eat plenty of berries and leafy greens which are high in omega 3s while being low in all other fats.thanks fruitbat ; i am not especially thrilled about eating meat again . it ’ s just that i have been a strict vegan for the last six months , and have greatly enjoyed eating whole food , but i have continued to loose my ability to walk . thanks for your suggestions ; i have been doing most of them including taking selenium ( plus eating beans twice a week ) , except for the kelp , and iodine . i will try this and see if it makes a difference in my abilities . i have been eating ground flax seeds , walnuts and flax oil for the omega 3 ’ s , but was thinking that there might be something to eating the omega 3 ’ s from a real fatty fish whole food source . i do want to continue to walk.i am so happy to help and hope it works out for you ! the lugol ’ s comes in different strengths ( from 2-15 % ) and qualities , some contain sodium iodide instead of the superior potassium iodide for example . don ’ t be afraid of consuming too much – in japan the average iodine intake from sea vegetable consumption is 13 milligrams a day , over 86 times higher than the rda of 150 micrograms recommended in the western world . one twelfth of a teaspoon of 7 % lugol ’ s contains 12.5 milligrams of iodine . 12.5 to 50 milligrams is considered by doctors who have studied iodine therapy to be a useful dose . it is best to start at the lower level , and consume it in a fruit smoothie as it disguises the taste while providing magnesium , which works with iodine in the body.it is important that the form of selenium is usable – the inorganic form such as selenite can be toxic if too much is consumed , and are difficult for the body to utilise . a good supplement is life extension se-methyl l selenocysteine.regarding omega 3 fats in fish , you ’ d have to consume 215g or nearly a whole fillet of salmon every day to provide enough , which would also give you 118 mg of cholesterol . additionally , it would give you 1.5g of methionine – more than you need in a day in a single piece of food – dr greger has a video about excessive methionine feeding cancer cells.algal supplements naturally contain dha and epa in a good 2 : 1 ratio , are free of mercury , and have not been chemically deodorized to disguise the smell of rotting fish . if your fat intake is low enough , the body can produce epa and dha from omega 3 ’ s found in plant foods , but a supplement can ’ t hurt if you feel you need one.on a personal note , i started the 80 / 10 / 10 high calorie raw fruit and leaf based diet several months ago , and while there were some general improvements in my health and appearance , i was disappointed that i didn ’ t get the incredible benefits claimed by other people , particularly in regard to my adhd . it is so disheartening and frustrating to be making the effort to do everything right and not see results . iodine was the missing link for me – sea vegetables are ignored ( though not prohibited ) on the 80 / 10 / 10 so if a person is already iodine deficient ( which is common , especially in sufferers of adhd ) this diet will not help to rectify the problem and may even make it worse . the same is true of a general plant based diet , since livestock fodder is fortified with iodine so that animal products provide small amounts , and people on plants based diets generally do not consume sea vegetables to make up for and better it.good luck to you , hopefully this extra information was helpful , and i really hope that supplementing with iodine will prove beneficial in reversing your msi am happy iy is working for you , making it part of your routine may help you significantly . thank you to share it.i ’ d just like to point out that vegans have always existed . meat eaters are overly fond of saying that humans have always eaten meat . no other primate habitually eats flesh , the only animal products other primates eat are insects.as someone who has lived with relapsing / remitting ms for about 27 years , this kind of upcoming report is very exciting to me . i own dr. swank ’ s book and have tried to model my diet on his , although i ’ ve never been 100 % faithful to the diet . i did want to correct an impression you gave in the article that interferon beta and chemo drugs are the only treatment options for ms. i ’ ve been on copaxone since 2000 and have had only one relapse during that time.i think at this point the best science supports dr. swank ’ s approach . you can read more about this issue on john mcdougall ’ s website which includes an interview with dr. swank . given the nature of the disease it is difficult and expensive to do good studies due to the time frames needed . i would not recommend meats or saturated fats at this time . hopefully the study that was funded by dr. mcdougall ’ s foundation will lead to a larger longer study . i can ’ t think of any downsides to his approach . i do know that if you have one chronic disease you don ’ t want another such as arterial disease or diabetes or cancer . good luck.the best science seems to show there is no effect . the study already has been published : http : / / www.neurology.org / content / 82 / 10 _ supplement / p6.152.shortthe study was not expected to show efficacy given the small numbers of participants ( 30 ) and limited time frame ( 1 year ) when considered relative to the natural time frame of ms ( years ) . dr. bourdette is hoping that this study will open the door to a much larger and longer term study which would be needed to actually show efficacy . so the best science is yet to come . it will most likely be done in europe as most studies in this country are done to test the use of drugs or procedures . i heard dr. bourdette speak at the mcdougall advanced study weekend at the time the study was funded . the interesting side note is it took the ethics committee at oregon health and science center a while to decide that a study which put participants on the intervention diet was safe ! so for now as i mentioned in my previous post i would recommend this approach to anyone who might have or does have ms. i have one patient who was wheel chair bound who benefited with better control of his type 1 diabetes and his wife says his stool problems have greatly improved . thanks for taking the time to comment and post the article … keep tuned to nf.org as the science keeps coming.the swank diet appears to include meat , eggs and dairy . it is not a vegan diet . to really benefit one needs to go vegan plus and eat a diet of whole organic plants while avoiding salt , sugar and refined carbohydrates. xyzmy sister has had ms for over 35 years . unfortunately , i do not think anybody shared the info generated by dr. swank ’ s research with her . we did not know it to share with her until the very recent years . she has been in a nursing home for about 13.5 years , unable to roll over in bed , or to move arms and legs . she is barely able to speak at this point , and has had stomach tube for liquid diet for years . she has been in hospice care for over a year . she is 63 years old . the disease has devastated her life.kathypoppyseed : re : ” unfortunately , i do not think anybody shared the info generated by dr. swank ’ s research with her . ” that ’ s just so criminal.this type of thing drives me * nuts . * dr. greger addresses this point yet again in his latest summary talk ( from table to able ) . our doctors and experts should be telling us what the science says . let us decide how we want to use that information . but they have no business patronizing us and hiding the information.ms is such a terrible disease , which your sister and you have first hand experience with . i ’ m sorry to hear about your situation.i switched over to a vegan diet recently and noticed an immediate improvement in terms of more energy and fat loss . i ’ m in medical school now and i believe that we will find out with more research that autoimmunity is the root cause of many seemingly unrelated diseases . my own theory is that the body gets confused by foreign animal proteins and mounts an autoimmune attack , and that the deleterious effects are only felt eventually over time . dr. greger has shown us countless studies on the benefits of a vegan diet . it really is a no-brainer at this point.what kind of food can i eat and could i get a recepie bookkags : i am not a doctor or expert and i do not know your situation . i can not make recommendations from either of those perspectives . however , i have purchased quite a few whole plant food based cookbooks over the last few years . i can recommend some books that based on my limited understanding would meet the needs of someone who is posting on this page.first , you might consider checking out dr. mcdougall ’ s book , the starch solution . the front part of the book contains some great info . and the back part contains some great recipes.while i just got , happy herbivore light and lean , i think it is going to be one of my favorite books . check it out ! if cost is an issue for you , check out vegan on the cheap ( and just don ’ t use oil for those recipes that call for it ) . for really simple recipes , check out vegan on $ 4 a day.if you have kids , check out let them eat vegan . ( or even if you don ’ t have kids , check it out . ) you might also want to check out some on-line resources , including pcrm ’ s site and the free 21 day kickstart program . they have a ton of free recipes that are healthy , tasty and easy to make.hope that helps.or appetite for reduction by isa chandra moshkowitzhttp : / / www.cpnhelp.org is an antibiotic protocol which has actually cured many many people.i feel like you are overpromising , dr. greger . my vegan friend with ms was vegan before her diagnosis ten years ago and has been vegan continuously for at least 3 decades . she is still crippled by her horrible ms symptoms.ms is as variable as humans are , to the extent that i call it “ the charlatan ’ s wet dream ” . whatever you pick , including nothing ( exercise , meditation , acupuncture , prayer , etc . ) , someone can point to it and say “ this worked for me ! ” . add biochemical individuality to spontaneous remission , the placebo effect , and confirmation bias , and stir in some charisma and scientific jargon , and you have a recipe for malady-based riches.she needs iodine . iodine . although being vegans doesn ’ t automatically mean one is eating a low saturated fat diet.read professor george jelinek ’ s book “ overcoming multiple sclerosis ” . he was diagnosed with ms in 1999 and due to his work as a professor of medicine , was in a position to access all the latest research about ms. his protocol is based on dr swank ’ s diet , vitamin d3 supplementation ( 5000iu daily ) , omega 3 as fish or flax oil daily , execise and meditation ( to alleviate stress ) . he has not had a relapse for about fourteen years . “ recovering from ms ” , also by jelinek , and law , is the stories of some of the people with ms who have used his protocol very successfully . he also has interviews on you tube.dr. greger , i ’ ll bring to your attention that mcdougall and yadav ’ s 1 year results have already been presented and published at 2014 american academy of neurology ’ s annual meeting . the results show no difference in presence of lesions , from mri scans . i refer you to : http : / / www.neurology.org / content / 82 / 10 _ supplement / p6.152 and http : / / www.healthline.com / health-news / low-fat-vegan-diet-may-ward-off-ms-fatigue-050614i do wish you would be equally vocal about studies that show no effect , at least as a reference to those who come to this page with high hopes.also bison is your alternative to beef . fish is also good for you . no beef , sugar or coffee . we are still working on the last 2 with my wifeit seems to me that there are two threads in this conversation , neither of which are recognizing the other . that can change , the recognition part , the conclusions do not need to change , necessarily . ok , on the one thread we have a description of doctor swank ’ s wor , which spans decades and has follow up results of both long and sort term duration . this thread also brings to the readers a recent controlled study initiated by dr. john mcdougall. the second thread is about the paleo diet and the results a physician got with that diet on her own case do multiple sclerosis . also sited is the commonality of large proportions of foods containing antioxidants . the book that woman wrote has been read by the participants in that thread . i have a sister who has had ms for 36 years . the last 13.5 years have been spent in a nursing home . the whole time she has been paralyzed , unable to move her arms or legs , unable to roll over , in bed without assistance . the last 5-7 years she has had a tube for feeding directly into her stomach , because she cannot swallow effectively . i could go on and on . she has been fed some variety of ensure , a liquid , which has kept her alive . she can also have snacks , of junk food , if someone feeds them to her , likeguess my reply was too long . i just want to concluded that i. do not think that my sister ever was told about dr. swank ’ s work . it is way too late for her now , but diet should be an integral , part of health care practices . ms is just one example of where that is so important . so people who understand that diet is so important ought to be getting on the same side in an effort to change established medical practices and establish food cultures . thanks , i have made my point poppyseedsomeone pointed out to me years ago that diet is the problem because in a lot of countries ms just don ’ t exist . i was very thankful for that infoa preliminary , not yet peer reviewed study released today reports no association between diet and ms. here is a link to a summary. http : / / www.medpagetoday.com / meetingcoverage / ectrims / 47667i find myself at a loss for what to believe . i suspect the study referenced above simply does not have enough participants following the actually food plan required to achieve the results we ’ d like to associate with a healthy vegan diet . anyone else feel like screaming ? oh , and note that in the study cited above , the only statistical correlation to reduced incidence of ms was high adherence to a western diet.yes , the authors have relationships with companies making ms products.she had amasing results . i don ’ t know if dr greger is aware of this ladyhttps : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = hlxxg49vzmui have 2 friends who have great results with their ms when they started taking juice plus + , and my own family has had amazing results as well ! can juice plus + help with multiple sclerosis ? though we cannot promise that juiceplus + will cure any illness or health condition , this is what i can say : ms is an autoimmune challenge that juice plus + can make a difference with , in time . it may take double the dosage , however , if the ms is severe.the immune study shows that b-cells become less hyperactive with juice plus + , i.e. make fewer antibodies against the body itself , which is the problem with all autoimmune disorders . autoimmune disorders show up in different ways in different people , manifesting symptoms based on our own unique genetic weaknesses.instead of focusing on the name of the disease , if we can go back to the cause of all autoimmune diseases – a trigger-happy immune system – then we do better . juice plus + makes the immune system less trigger-happy . “ clean eating fitness junkie ” http : / / www.facebook.com / jenpalbci invite you … to watch this video that could change your health & the health of your family in numerous ways ! http : / / safeshare.tv / w / ociscsvcthwe have been taking juice plus + capsules and drinking the complete shakes for a couple of years now . we ’ ve all experienced better sleep , healthier hair , nails , skin , teeth & gums , and a huge boost in our immune systems , which means we have more energy ! no flu ( and no , we do not get the flu shot ) ! ! i haven ’ t even had a cold ( knock on wood ) ! my husband & kids have had only 1 cold ! my husband & i compared our yearly physical blood work results from before & after starting juice plus + and all of our numbers improved ! our pediatrician was wondering where we ’ ve been , because the kids haven ’ t had a single “ sick visit ” in over 2 years ! we show up one a year for “ well child ” check-ups and that ’ s it ! my son used to catch strep-throat multiple times a year : ( ! the most amazing thing of all , and one of the reason i decided to promote this amazing whole food nutrition is my husband ’ s miraculous results while taking a double dose of juice plus + before & after his tonsillectomy , and all during & after his 6 weeks of daily radiation therapy . all 4 of his dr. ’ s kept asking “ how were you able to work so long while going through radiation ? ” and “ what ever you ’ re doing , keep it up ! ” “ i ’ ve never seen someone recover so quickly ! ” “ your health is incredible ! ” “ you are cured ! ” … .on and on and on.anyway , i just feel really passionate about this product and decided to promote it , in hopes that others can experience the vast improvements in health like we have . it ’ s also great for those with diabetes , because you can get all of your fruits & vegetables without any of the sugar ! i love that juice plus + is not a supplement … .it ’ s actual real food nutrition ! please let me know if you have any questions , or want more information . i would love to hear from you ! if you ’ d like to give juice plus + a try , please contact me or you can even go directly to my website and order from there.http : / / jennifer-palazzolo.juiceplus.com / content / juiceplus / en / what-is-juice-plus / what-is-juice-plus.html # .vebcypldxngone of the most compelling things about juice plus + is the fact that there have been over 30 research studies conducted in leading hospitals & universities around the world . the studies and results are available on my website : http : / / jennifer-palazzolo.juiceplus.com / content / juiceplus / en / clinical-research / clinical-research.htmlhave a great day ! jeni have ms since 2007 . my lifestyle and my nutrition were so bad but i had just one redicive i all my life , at the moment . when i ask the people who have ms as well , the people tell me almost the same , their lifestyle and nutrion are so f … bad . i don ´ t know if the vegetarian people have better life than people who eat meat but i think that we need some nutrients as vitamin b and we can ´ t find in veggies … we need vitamin d , we need omega 3 … and normally the people who eat the meat don ´ t have a good lifestyle ( because they meet trans-fat , drink sugar ¨ liquid ” as coca-cola , mcdonalds … . ) and the vegetarian people are interesting more in their nutrition … but i am totally sure … we need a god meat ! dear dr. greger , thank you for this article . the mcdougall ’ s study on multiple sclerosis and diet has been published and no real difference was seen between the “ diet ” and “ control ” groups in mri images ; nor was a difference in disability or relapses seen between the diet intervention and control groups . what is your opinion ? thank you.seriously wondering would fresh meat from a deli cause relapses also ? it might . deli meat still has loads of saturated fat so if high animal fat is one of the culprits then limiting or avoiding meat ( deli meat ) may be considered. acute myeloid leukemia , africa , aging , angiogram , animal fat , animal products , asia , autoimmune diseases , beef , bladder disease , bladder health , brain disease , brain health , cardiovascular health , chemotherapy , chicken , cholesterol , cognition , dairy , dr. caldwell esselstyn , dr. dean ornish , dr. john mcdougall , dr. roy swank , eggs , europe , eye disease , eye health , fat , fatigue , heart disease , heart health , inflammation , ldl cholesterol , leukemia , low-fat diets , meat , medications , milk , mortality , multiple sclerosis , nerve health , norway , pain , plant-based diets , pork , poultry , pritikin , saturated fat , sausage , side effects , surgery , tremors , turkey , vegans , vegetarians , vision weakness - -

PLAIN-11	living longer by reducing leucine intake many studies have shown that calorie restriction , without malnutrition , can increase lifespan and lower the risk of age-related diseases , such as cancer . however , for many people , calorie restriction clearly has its drawbacks . in the classic minnesota starvation study , many of the volunteers suffered a preoccupation with food , constant hunger , binge eating , and lots of emotional and psychological issues . even researchers who study caloric restriction rarely practice it . there ’ s got to be a better way to suppress the aging engine enzyme , tor ( see why do we age ? for more on tor ) . that ’ s why researchers were so excited about rapamycin , a drug that inhibits tor , thinking it could be caloric restriction in a pill . but like any drug , it a long list of potentially serious side effects . there ’ s got to be a better way . the breakthrough came when scientists discovered that the benefits of dietary restriction may be coming not from restricting calories , but from restricting protein intake ( see my video caloric restriction vs. animal protein restriction ) . if we look at the first comprehensive , comparative meta-analysis of dietary restriction , “ the proportion of protein intake was more important for life extension than the degree of caloric restriction . ” in fact , just “ reducing protein without any changes in calorie level have been shown to have similar effects as caloric restriction . ” that ’ s good news . protein restriction is much less difficult to maintain than dietary restriction , and it may even be more powerful because it suppresses both tor and igf-1 , the two pathways thought responsible for the dramatic longevity and health benefits of caloric restriction . some proteins are worse than others . one amino acid in particular , leucine , appears to exert the greatest effect on tor . in fact , just cutting down on leucine may be nearly as effective as cutting down on all protein . where is leucine found ? predominantly animal foods : eggs , dairy , and meat ( including chicken and fish ) . plant foods , such as fruits , vegetables , grains , and beans , have much less . “ in general , lower leucine levels are only reached by restriction of animal proteins . ” to reach the leucine intake provided by dairy or meat , we ’ d have to eat nine pounds of cabbage — about four big heads — or 100 apples . these calculations exemplify the extreme differences in leucine amounts provided by a conventional diet in comparison to a plant-based diet . the functional role of leucine in regulating tor activity may help explain the extraordinary results reported in the cornell-oxford-china study , “ since quasi-vegan diets of modest protein content tend to be relatively low in leucine . ” this may also help explain the longevity of populations like the okinawa japanese , who have about half our mortality rate . the traditional okinawan diet is only about 10 % protein , and practically no cholesterol , because they ate almost exclusively plants . less than one percent of their diet was fish , meat , eggs , and dairy – the equivalent of one serving of meat a month and one egg every two months . their longevity is surpassed only by vegetarian adventists in california , who have perhaps the highest life expectancy of any formally studied population in history . this reminds me of the study i profiled in the benefits of caloric restriction without the actual restricting . methionine is another amino acid that may be associated with aging . see methionine restriction as a life extension strategy to find out which foods to avoid in that case . both leucine and methionine content may be additional reasons why plant protein is preferable . other reasons why those eating plant-based diets may live longer : this all may help explain the results of harvard ’ s meat and mortality studies . what are the practical protein recommendations for us to follow ? how much protein should we eat daily to not activate tor , but to fulfill our nutritional needs ? can we eat unlimited vegetable protein since it is low in leucine and methionine ? here are some protein recommendations . in the last link of this blog dr. greger mentions how plant protein is preferable . it ’ s hard to say exactly how much protein to restrict to suppress tor . the recommendations for protein intake vary from 10-35 % of total calories . the tradition okinawan diet is only about 10 % protein , so perhaps the lower end of that range ( 10-35 % ) is preferred.maybe this is a stretch , but i was thinking that if nature provides growing , developing infants with an ideal formula in mother ’ s milk , maybe our nutritional guidelines should be based close to that proven ratio , so i investigated it and was very surprised by what i found … ( remember it is mostly water . ) mature human milk contains 3 % – 5 % fat , 0.8 % – 0.9 % protein , 6.9 % – 7.2 % carbohydrate calculated as lactose , and 0.2 % mineral constituents expressed as ash . its energy content is 60 – 75 kcal / 100 ml.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 392766thanks , charzie . since the values you gave are by weight , i converted them to percent of calories . human breast milk contains ~ 5 % protein , 54 % fat and 41 % carbohydrate . pretty surprising that protein is so low . i ’ m guessing that the growing infant needs lots of healthy fats for brain development , that adults probably don ’ t.thanks so much julie , a math whiz i am not , but thought it was interesting with all the questions about protein we get grilled about . i agree about the brain growth and the fat % … plus it is very easy to digest and utilize and comes with all kinds of amazing benefits , including even pro and pre biotics . once past nursing age i ’ m sure the ratios shift to less fat and more carbs , ( but cow ’ s milk is never an acceptable substitute for infants for numerous reasons . ) if adults ingest that much fat , well … i had diabetes and it was all about the fat because dropping it to > 10 % made it go away before i even lost much weight ! the amino acid in plant based diets that is likely to be limiting is lysine ( not to be confused with leucine ) . consume enough lysine in a varied plant based diet , and you ’ re likely to have adequate amounts of all the other essential amino acids.beans , greens and potatoes have more lysine relative to their leucine + methionine content than other higher protein plant foods : potatoes ( 0.83 ) , legumes , greens ( 0.7 ) , nuts & seeds ( 0.5 ) grains ( 0.3 ) , so even though the leucine content of beans may seem high in absolute terms , they still offer the best balance of adequate lysine without excess leucine and methionine . food group leaders by this measure include cauliflower ( 1.72 ) , split peas and lentils ( 0.86 ) , pumpkin seeds ( 0.70 ) , buckwheat & quinoa ( 0.67 ) .the more i look at potatoes , the more they appear like the ideal staple . compare the percent of amino acid requirements for a 60 kg adult in 2000 kcal of these foods : potato skim milk whole eggs his 147 % 1000 % 720 % iso 141 % 853 % 782 % leu 106 % 802 % 649 % lys 151 % 921 % 709 % met + cys 159 % 712 % 1013 % phe + tyr 220 % 1353 % 1099 % thr 180 % 941 % 864 % try 227 % 1053 % 973 % val 168 % 833 % 769 % fiber 203 % 0 % 0 % one could eat nothing but potatoes and get adequate but not excessive amounts of every essential amino acid ( and be well ahead on the fiber and potassium fronts , as well ) .thanks , darryl . i eat lots of beans , greens and potatoes so i guess i ’ m all set on amino acids.darryl , i ’ m curious , what is your area of expertise ? thanks for all your amazing insights here on nf forum.i have an undergraduate degree in biochemistry but have worked most recently in computer science . i just discovered ( largely inspired by dr. greger ) a fascination with the underreported sides of nutritional science , and in particular its relation to chronic and aging-related disease , and so for the past two years , on average i download 3-5 papers daily from the primary literature , and when i find time read a couple.cool ! biochemistry is definitely an great foundation for the field of nutrition . so , you are in the vanguard of two fields that can change the world ( nutrition and technology ) . amazing ! keep going ! what do you make of the glycemic load of potatoes ? according to nutritiondata , the gl of a large baked russet is 29 . see http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / vegetables-and-vegetable-products / 2550 / 2there ’ s no question potatoes have a pretty high glycemic index , and hence present an issue for those who already have insulin resistance or diabetes . there ’ s perhaps a saving grace in that a substantial fraction of their starch will gelatinise / anneal into digestion resistant starch if baked and allowed to cool for a few hours.sweet potatoes are nutritionally superior in most respects , with 2000 kcal complete in all essential nutrients for a 60 kg adult except b9 , k , se , and maybe efas ( some greens and a brazil nut would fix this ) , and moreover have a glycemic index about half that of potatoes . i wish that i enjoyed their taste more ( i find them too sweet in most dishes ) .darryl : thanks for this post . i like how you put all that information together . very helpful.re : “ … i wish that i enjoyed their taste more . ” you may feel that way about all sweet potatoes , but i thought i would share that i find that the sweet potatoes that are white or purple-fleshed are a lot less sweet than the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes . and i have had great success in substituting those types / colors of sweet potatoes in dishes without problem . sometimes i even like the sweet ones better in dishes that call for regular potatoes.i just wanted to share because i generally do not like the orange-fleshed sweet potatoes and was happy to discover a few years ago that the other colors actually taste different to me . plus they have a better texture than the orange ones i think.just sharing.adding fiber or fat will low the glycemic load of potatoes – and of any food , so to speak.and what about the phytonutrients in potatoes ? i have been following a plant based diet for the last 2 years , and before that i used to intermittently fast every 3 months to lower my igf-1 and mtor levels , which i get measured every few months . since following your site the last few months and reading the very interesting article i have increased my intake of black beans and other legumes to benefit from their potential . however this article about leucine seems contradictory to that of increasing bean intake , such as black beans , to improve long appear to contain a reasonable quantity of leucine.leucine is still an essential amino acid so humans require dietary sources . the average 140 pound adult needs roughly 2673 mg per day . also , i feel if we spend too much time worrying about one essential amino acid we forget about the massive amount of iron , zinc , fiber , antioxidants and phytochemicals in black beans . they are such a healthful food that i would hate to see folks limit them based off their higher leucine content.that was my thinking as well , i will see how my increased consumption in black beans has affected my igf-1 levels next week . keep you posted ; - ) ) thanksplease , chris – really interested to know what have worked best in lowering igf-1 levels ! what is the current thinking on resveratrol and aging ? the primary target for resveratrol is activation of sirt 1 . there are a lot of data “ out there ” regarding resveratrol – some data suggest reduced risk for cardiovascular disease , diabetes , some neurological diseases and various cancers . probably no effect on maximum lifespan in humans ( as opposed to cr ) , but probably effect on health span in some subgroups . resveratrol is not the fountain of youth and resveratrol can in no way outweigh a poor diet . regarding health there are no alternative to a diet as near as possible to wfpb diet.plantstrongdoc gave the link to a study in another blog i ’ ll post it here , if interested . thanks , dommy ! joseph , as you know resveratrol is just one out af several polyphenols that have been extensively studied – others are quercetin , genistein , catechin and others – and data suggests considerable health benefits . resveratrol is probably famous because it is present in red wine – and hence a very studied compound . others are also “ potent compounds ” – and the “ secret ” behind the enormous health benefits from a plant based diet is probably a synergistic effect from all the polyphenols and it can of course not just be reduced to resveratrol or quercetin – but a very interesting field.this is not news to nf readers but here ’ s the latest study correlating nut consumption and longevity : “ nuts and peanuts , but not peanut butter , may protect against death from cancer , heart disease , respiratory disease , and other major causes ” http : / / www.alphagalileo.org / viewitem.aspx ? itemid = 153534 & culturecode = enthank you , joseph.awesome. thank you ! just curious , what does the photo have to do with this topic . looks like a mcdonald ’ s fish sandwich.i was trying to contrast caloric restriction versus animal protein restriction – quantity of food versus quality of food . sounds like it didn ’ t come across . if you can find a better creative commons pic i ’ ll swap it out ! not an easy task. how about this : https : / / flic.kr / p / 53rvyti will some more for a photo . the other thing i don ’ t get about the picture above is the shoe lace or whatever that is . and is that photo supposed to be showing both animal protein and plant protein ? i don ’ t see that . not an important part of this great article , just something that made me wonder.dr. greger , i posted the below comment on your calorie restriction vs. animal protein restriction video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / caloric-restriction-vs-animal-protein-restriction / i ’ m glad you wrote more about this topic , but i ’ d love for you to discuss more about the shared connection mtor has with aging and muscle protein synthesis . the studies i reference below discuss how mtor is the pathway that leucine uses to signal muscle protein synthesis . for plant-based people who want to build lean muscle mass , i ask again , are these goals ( longevity vs. building lean muscle mass ) fundamentally opposed goals since they both seem to occur through the same amino acid ( leucine ) acting on the same signaling pathway ( mtor ) ? or , hypothetically , could is be a case of plant vs. animal sources of protein similar to your dozen videos on plant vs. meat nitrates ( see more in my original comment below ) .thanks for your consideration.original comment — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — – it seems that both signaling muscle protein synthesis ( mps ) and aging prematurely ( as discussed in this and previous video ) involve the leucine / mtor connection . do you think , or is there research , that long life and building muscle mass are fundamentally opposed goals based on how our body is designed ? also , do you think , or is there research , that the mtor theory of aging and leucine acting as a trigger could be meat / animal-protein specific ? in other words , could eating leucine-rich plant foods in order to signal mps still provide longevity benefits as well as muscle-building benefits ? kind of similar to the whole nitrate / nitrite conundrum where plant-sourced nitrates ( from beets and arugula ) get metabolized in the stomach and re-sent to the mouth where , instead of becoming carcinogenic nitrosamines ( as is what happens when you consume nitrates from meat ) , they become no and increase our oxygen efficiency . this seems plausible to me since you ’ ve praised pumpkins seeds ( which are relatively high in leucine ) in some past videos : ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = p … specifically the mineral content and serotonin boosting effect.research papers describing mps and leucine signaling : – http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16365096 – http : / / jap.physiology.org / content / 106 / 6 / 2026 – http : / / www.biolayne.com / wp-content / uploads / norton-j-ag-food-ind-hi-tech-2008.pdfhi michael . i meant to give this to you earlier , thanks for the reminder ! here are a few position papers that discuss protein needs in athletes . 1 ) nutrition and athletic performance and 2 ) position of the american dietetic association and dietitians of canada : vegetarian diets and a more recent version , here . the exact amount of protein for athletes to maintain and build muscle mass without stimulating tor is very hard to determine . i do not think any study has been conducted to know for certain . again , i think you ’ re onto something , as even though pumpkin seeds may be higher in leucine they provide fiber , antioxidants , and other phytochemicals that eggs and chicken do not.i think this is an important question . sarcopenia is a serious concern for older people ( like me ) as it can lead to falls , fractures , diabetes , or otherwise restrict the quality of one ’ s life . i find it sad to see older people who are frail due to sarcopenia , since it is unnecessary . it is certainly significantly more difficult to build lean muscle when one is over 65 , at least that ’ s my personal experience . because of this , i think it wise to pay attention to muscle mass when one is younger ( wish i had paid more attention ) – it ’ s much easier to maintain it than create when one is a senior . living longer does not necessarily mean a better quality of life . picking out one aspect of health ( not stimulating tor ) and then overly restricting protein to achieve that one goal could well backfire way down the road.here ’ s the url for a short and inconclusive overview of some studies and issue from harvard : http : / / www.health.harvard.edu / blog / daily-protein-needs-seniors-still-unsettled-201406117208great point , for those over 65 more protein is required . the low end of protein recommendations are between 0.8-0.9g / kg for adults . after 65 years old , based on this study , i would suggest bumping up these recommendations.i also saw that study when was published several months ago . i recall they categorized less than 10 % of calories from protein ‘ low protein ' ; between 10 and 20 % ‘ moderate protein ' ; and over 20 % protein ‘ high protein ’ diets . those under 65 did better on low and moderate protein diets , but those over 65 did better on high protein diets insofar as cancer was concerned … but they had much more diabetes . so it ’ s a tough call to recommend a high protein diet even for seniors . i guess it really depends on how many calories you take in.for a typical 80 kg . ( 175 lb . ) man , a moderate recommendation would be 1 gram of protein x 80 , or 80 grams / day . say this guy eats 2,400 calories – which a lot of active men do . 80 grams of protein is about 320 calories , so he should be aiming for 320 / 2,400 or 12.5 % of calories from protein . that ’ s low-moderate . to be considered ‘ high protein ’ , he ’ d have to consume over 480 protein calories , or 120 grams . that ’ s 50 % over the moderate recommendation of 1 gram per kg. of body weight , and nearly twice the rda set by official health organizations ( 0.8 grams per kg . ) .i just doubt that getting 1.5 grams / kg. is a good idea when so many seniors suffer from reduced kidney function ( about a third of those > 60 have stage 3 ckd ) . but maybe vegetable sourced protein is ok ? thanks for sharing your thoughts . i think it ’ s noteworthy that the high protein group eating animal protein in this study was responsible for 75 % increased overall mortality and a 4-fold increase in risk of dying from cancer , compared with higher protein intake from plant sources . the increased risk of diabetes mortality seemed strange . i wonder if they controlled for animal protein ? i would agree that 1.0g / kg is probably better than 1.5g / kg , but keep in mind protein recommendations vary based on individual needs.thanks for the reply . the study you cite is very interesting , particularly to me the part about older people having more difficulty producing sufficient igf-1 for good health ( not sure what that level might be ) .this underscores the fact that nutrition and health is a complicated topic ! more of something is not necesssarily better , but the same can be said for less.i share your concern about getting enough protein to just maintain strength and muscle mass at 60 this yr . i ’ ve been pretty much vegan for 2 yrs and lost 15 lbs down to 150 at 6ft tall . i measure my strength every month by how many pushups , situps , pullups , and dumbbell presses i can do . i didn ’ t want to become the typical skinny , weak vegan example . out of 21 meals i include one with fish.i recently upped my protein to maybe 50 or 60g from a low in the 30-40 area as it was a struggle to keep up the reps and no muscle mass gains . all downhill into our 80s … grr so i ’ ll see if that makes a difference . a vegan muscle building site recommends 150g of protein for a 150lb man . i ’ m not about to do that.i am 81 and fair health but nothing serious , yet . i read this about leucine . “ excess leucine may be a cause of pellagra , whose main symptoms are “ the four d ’ s ” : diarrhea , dermatitis , dementia and death , [ 10 ] though the relationship is unclear ” i have considered adding protein powder to my morning smoothies . doesn ’ t seem like a good idea . i don ’ t work out except a short walk a few times a week but watching my diet and food i eat . i am 5ft 7in and 154 lb.sounds like you ’ re doing pretty darn good at 81 rob . i guess i raised the bar pretty high for myself having the superman jack lalanne for a role model .. lol he was in great shape all the way to 97 by working out every morning at 5 and then 6am for more than an hr . he ate alot of fruit and salad , but also ate egg whites and salmon every day . i ’ m trying to avoid doing that.i am wondering why your protein intake is so low compared to mine . according to chron-o-meter , a typical days worth of food on my diet provides about 75g of protein . since i am only 5 ’ 7 ″ , small framed and 124 pounds ( 56 kg ) , i doubt my difficulty building muscle is protein related since i ’ m getting about 1.3g / kg / day , which i ’ ve seen recommended for seniors ( i ’ m 68 ) . when i used to do a lot of weight lifting ( which i only started in my early 50s ) , i was a long time vegetarian but ate a lot of dairy , including whey protein , but quit heavy lifting and focused on aerobic conditioning about 3-4 years ago , and about a year ago switched from long time vegetarian to vegan . the combined change dropped my weight from about 142 to 124 . i am happy about losing fat but i clearly also lost a lot of muscle as i am not nearly as strong these days . i am trying hard to regain some of that muscle but it is a struggle . i have read that for seniors , increasing volume of resistance exercise is needed to adequately stimulate muscle growth , but don ’ t have the references handy . keep up the good fight ! i guess i get too full eating fruit , potato and salad and haven ’ t paid much attention to protein . i don ’ t use protein powder , just added beans 3 times a day , plus quinoa and sweet peas . i did some exercise most of my life . i guess i miss the good old days at age 30 when gaining strength and size was easy and felt strong before a workout . i haven ’ t really lost any muscle at 60 and i ’ d like to keep it that way . but i am finding it harder to make any gains.well after 2 wks of increasing my plant protein and a bit of fat from nuts i ’ m pleased with the results in both strength and mass . also feel stronger and more “ puffed up ” in the legs , back and arms . that ’ s a big plus because it helps make the wrinkles in the arms and even under my eyes decrease . i may not have been eating enough fat along with enough protein . i also gained 3 lbs , to 153 assuming it is muscle . so it ’ s not all downhill ( getting weaker ) from 60 to 80 even on a plant based diet.sitting 50 lb overhead press increased from 22 to 31 my weakest event . squats with 35 lb from 32 to 42 reps , 5 sets pull-ups 5 to 7 chin-ups 7 to 8 sit-ups still 80 in 2 min.now i am wondering whether significantly increased amounts of leucine post strenuous exercise , e.g. from heavy weight lifting , might not have the negative effects it would otherwise have . the last article cited by michael got me thinking about this.leucine is still an essential amino acid . i think the idea is that consuming too much may be problematic , but lower amounts are fine and still necessary . i suggest shooting for the low end of protein recommendations , but as we discussed bumping up needs after 65 years old.i am pretty sure the calorie-restriction-longevity idea has been discredited for humans ( even though it holds for rats and mice ) . not that it is central to your posting . but it might be best not to feature that idea since it seems to fly in the face of evidence ( for humans and at least some other primates ) .instead of just saying that , perlis , can you show us a link to something that goes against the evidence that the doctor stated . thanks , johnhas cr been discredited ? there are contradictory primate studies on this issue , both of which have some serious issues . as for the human studies , none is long enough to make a proper determination of lifespan extension , but most biomarkers look positive for cr . one thing that is quite clear , is that equilibrium species ( such as humans ) are not going to see the 30-40 % maximal lifespan increases with cr that have been shown for mice . the traditional long-lived okinawans are perhaps the best example of moderate cr combined with low protein intake , but there are several other lifestyle factors that likely contribute as well.vegetarian adventists in california study you linked to http : / / www.pkdiet.com / pdf / vegetarianism.pdfconclusions : choices regarding diet , exercise , cigarette smoking , body weight , and hormone replacement therapy , in combination , appear to change life expectancy by many years.so – how can you claim that diet alone is responsible for the increase in life expectancy ? ? this is only a partial answer to your question , but the video at this link http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / vegetarians-versus-healthy-omnivores / shows evidence that the plant-based diet has a protective effect that goes beyond that of other healthy choices . this is not at all to say that exercising , not smoking , and so on aren ’ t very important to one ’ s health , but diet really does seem to be the most important factor of all . i believe that there are other videos here related to this topic that i didn ’ t have time to browse around for

sites to argue with them ? i am not trying to be hostile or anything ; i am just curious.i find the scientific evidence offered by dr. greger very helpful for my lifestyle choices . what do you find here that supports your day to day life ? thanks ! dr. greger , i have a question . i have been following a low-fat , whole-food , plant-based lifestyle for 4 years . i am now a consultant for the lifestyle and have my own business : attainable wellness . i have also been using liquid aminos for seasoning on a daily basis . liquid aminos have leucine and methionine as well as other amino acids that are derived from soy beans . after reading your article i wonder if liquid aminos are healthy ? could you share your opinion ? i don ’ t want to lead myself or my clients astray.thank you so much , sherry pattersonattainable wellnesshttp : / / www.attainablewellnessinc.comsherry @ attainablewellnessinc.coman oldie but useful . is msg bad for you ? . keep in mind there is less than a half a gram of protein in liquid aminos . i am not advocating it , but if you like the taste i see no reason to avoid based on the animo acids content.it might be interesting to note that soy protein isolates are very high in leucine ( http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / foods-000082000000000000000.html ) … but as previously noted ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-much-soy-is-too-much / ) 3-5 servings of ( whole ) soy is better for you . looks like those transitional “ vegan faux-meats ” based on tvp may not be a “ safe ” alternative afterall.i wonder if leucine from plant sources is any different than leucine from animal sources ? … some of the top foods with high leucine levels are from plants : soy protein isolate , spirulina and watercress ! : - ( good points ! please see my comments below in this thread . it may help explain your two recent questions . thanks.there ’ re only two types of leucine : l-leucine and d-leucine . plants and animals contain only l-leucine , so the leucine vegans get from food and that omnivorous do are one and the same : l-leucine.what are your thoughts on liquid aminos as a seasoning . they contain leucine and methionine derived from soy beans.please see my comments below to sherry . thanks , unless this is sherry from another account , in which case please see my reply to your original comment : - ) “ to reach the leucine intake provided by dairy or meat , we ’ d have to eat nine pounds of cabbage — about four big heads — or 100 apples . ” i ’ m just wondering if the nine pounds of cabbage would relate to , say , a cup of yogurt . — or maybe a half cup . or three cups . in other words , how big a portion of animal protein are we talking ? according to cronometer.com , 9 lb of cooked green cabbage contains 1.7g of leucine . the same amount is contained in 1.3 cups of plain , lowfat yogurt.i am 65 years old and my arms — the skin of my arms — has become ultra sensitive . i am a passionate vegan and i would never go back on this one ; however , every single time i show what happens to my skin in my arms — that is the only part of my skin where it happens — they tell me immediately that the problem comes from not eating enough “ animal protein ” . let me explain what happens : a little heavier pressure on the skin of my arms causes the capillary vessels to explode and bathe with blood a vast region . eventually it all goes back to normal . my mother was not vega at all and she had the same weakness ; so , it has to be some sort of genetical trend , or is it ? what would the advice be ? i ’ m not sure how animal protein would “ fix ” the problem . you could try and see if there is a difference ? we have many videos on skin health . protein , vitamins , and minerals are important for generating new growth of skin , hair and nails . so long as these nutrients are adequate i would expect proper growth . have you seen a dermatologist ? what did your doctor recommend ? did you check your bleeding , prothrombin , and coagulation times ? i see that soy foods and nuts and seeds , even beans are high in leucine . should one avoid them too ? what is the leucine content of nuts and seeds . should they be restricted.i understand that some plan foods are high in methionine , like sesame seeds . would you recommend limiting these foods ? i eat a whole food plant-based diet since my breast cancer diagnosis and i was wondering if i should limit my consumption of tahini.good question , cecile , and i see that nobody ’ s responded . in addition to methionine and leucine , other amino acids may be troublesome : arginine also appears to stimulate mtor signaling and many cancers thrive on glutamine . as for sesame seeds , they also contain a fairly significant amount of copper , which stimulates angiogenesis . as a cancer survivor , i opt for following the precautionary principle – and have eliminated sesame seed paste . according to the nutritiondata website , chia seems to be a healthy alternative . compared to other common seeds , it ’ s lower in glutamic acid and very low in methionine.speaking of the okinawans , you profiled a study a ways back talking about the benefits of the sweet potato , as far as undigested proteins of s.p. having positive effect , but is there also a negative effect as far as undigested proteins circulating the body , causing immune or gut issues ? i ’ ve always heard that undigested proteins can be a bad thing as well . thoughts on this , dr. g ? thanks.i am wondering which study you are referring to . one of the reasons i quit taking ppis for acid reflux was the issue of undigested proteins causing allergies . so this sounds odd to me but i have not seen the video.dr. greger did a video highlighting the benefits of sweet potatoes , and he said that parts of the sweet potato proteins remaining undigested are what created these said benefits . so yeah , for some folks maybe undigested proteins do not cause harm but i am wondering if this applies to the sweet potatoes as well.i got a little confused . here lucene shortens my life. but in every bodybuilding guidebook it ’ s one of the essential aminos that every sportsman should take . even they claim it is good that it activates mtor . i had read that 5- ' 10mg a day is essential to gain muscle . where s the middle ? here are some protein recommendations . in the last link of this blog dr. greger mentions how plant protein is preferable . it ’ s hard to say exactly how much protein to restrict to suppress tor . the recommendations for protein intake vary from 10-35 % of total calories . the tradition okinawan diet is only about 10 % protein , so perhaps the lower end of that range ( 10-35 % ) is preferred . the low end of protein recommendations are between 0.8-0.9g / kg for adults . after 65 years old , based on this study i would suggest bumping up these recommendations . for athletes now we ’ re talking a new ballgame . i talk about that further down in the thread about protein needs , of course they can vary depending on individual needs.don ’ t know if this will help anyone ’ s fears or not , but i looked up leucene amounts for 1 cup of a few foods that people might easily / naturally eat a cup of at one time — on the nutrtionself.com website : chicken : 2827 mg pinto beans : 1308 mg quinoa : 483 mg brown rice : 372 mg broccoli : 230 mgso , even though beans are higher in leucine than say brocooli , beans still have * significantly * less leucine than say chicken . given the abundance of evidence we have on the benefits of beans ( check out : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = beans ) , i say , “ pass me some beans , please ! ” sources : chicken : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts /

2what about soy protein from tofu or tempeh ? you mention vegetables and beans , but not soy products.we mention tofu and tempeh in our soy section.however , some other studies show that supplementing leucine extends lifespan in mice.even though the results of the study , published in the journal cell metabolism , are based on animal studies , they hold a lot of promise especially in our efforts to keep old age at bay.in the study , dr. enzo nisoli , of the university of milan gave mice drinking water laced with three amino acids — leucine , isoleunic and valine . at the end of the study , the mice receiving the amino-acid cocktail extended their lifespan by 12 per cent compared to the control group receiving ordinary water.small typo : “ it a long ” should probably be “ it has a long ” as an athlete i know that leucine is probably the most important amino acid for anabolic response , and proteins are as good s their leucine content , so if i want to be stronger and build muscle , dont i need plenty of leucine ? alas , mtor is responsible for some anabolism ( and in the hypothalamus , satiety ) , but also suppresses catabolic processes like autophagy that confer protection against aging related diseases . there may be a fundamental downside to depending on leucine for anabolic response and weight loss.there is a bright side : while protein restricted animals live longer , and leucine related mtor inhibition appears to account for some of this , most of the benefit of protein restriction is captured in experiments that just restrict methionine . excess methionine appears harmful by an different mechanism , increasing mitochondrial membrane potential and ros production.so , there ’ s the option of attempting to maximize benefits from higher leucine intake while minimizing excess methionine ( and probably cysteine , which spares methionine requirements ) . foods with high leu / ( met + cys ) include most legumes ( avg 3.2 ) , azuki beans ( 4.2 ) , kidney beans ( 3.8 ) , , peas in pod ( 5.3 ) , almonds ( 4.0 ) , corn ( 3.7 ) , green peas ( 2.8 ) with soy at ( 2.7 ) . for comparison , whey ’ s ratio is 2.2 and egg whites are 1.5 , so for a given amount of leucine kidney beans would provide only 40 % the met + cys load . there ’ s also the strong possibility in the literature that two conditionally-essential amino acids , glycine and serine , may mimic methionine restriction , and many of the same foods rate highly for gly + ser / met + cys content . i like glycine as a bedtime hibiscus tea sweetener.could you explain how cysteine “ spares methionine requirements ” ? and where ’ s the evidence for serine ? speaking of amino acids , i ’ ve also read that arginine stimulates mtor signaling http : / / www.mdpi.com / 1422-0067 / 12 / 1 / 506 / htm and that many cancers thrive on glutamine. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2917518 / comments ? you ’ re always so insightful.what would you ( and everybody else ) say about the links ( below ) i came across some time ago ? “ cancer cells require the amino acids glycine , glutamic acid , aspartic acid , and serine to synthesize dna , build new blood vessels , and duplicate their entire protein contents . they also require these and certain other amino acids to synthesize other proteins that act as growth-promoting hormones or tumor growth factors . the controlled amino acid formula impairs the synthesis of a protein called elastin , which is absolutely essential to the manufacture of new blood vessels . ” ​ https : / / www.apjohncancerinstitute.org / caat-protocol “ this led to the identification of glycine – a non-essential amino acid – as a metabolite that is consumed by rapidly growing cancer cells and released by slow-growing cancer cells . glycine is endogenously produced in both the cytosol and mitochondria ; using genetic profiling , the authors determined that transformed cells have an increased reliance on either exogenous glycine or glycine produced by the mitochondrial pathway . ” ​ http : / / dmm.biologists.org / content / 5 / 4 / 415.3.full “ one of the most striking results of the new data is how the pattern of glycine consumption relates to the speed of cancer-cell division . in the slowest dividing cells , small amounts of glyine are released into the culture media . but in cancer cells that are rapidly dividing , glycine is rapaciously consumed . the researchers note that very few metabolites have this unusual pattern of “ crossing the zero line , ” meaning that rapidly dividing cancer cells consume the metabolite while slowly dividing cells actually release it . ” http : / / www.sciencedaily.com / releases / 2012 / 05 / 120524143446.htm “ not all cancers show up on fdg pet scans , and that could be because some use glutamine metabolism rather than glycolysis . or they could depend on still another nutrient , the amino acid glycine . a may 2012 article in science found that , in a study of 1,300 samples of tumors from early-stage breast cancer patients , those whose tumors had higher levels of glycine synthesis were more likely to die from the disease.researchers know very little about how the body regulates glycine metabolism . yet its contribution to tumor cell proliferation only increases the evidence that changes in metabolism are a cause of cancer and not just a consequence . ” ​

all his suggestions but i have to object to his charactorization of calorie restriction as a diet with constant hunger , many emotional and psychological issues , etc . the minnesota starvation study is esp unfair as a basis for evaluating cr . i believe it is the study conducted during wwii using soldiers or consciencious objectors who were forced to participate in the study . why not use research conducted in the last 20 years with willing participants who are committed to cr ? like me . i have practiced a vegan , cr lifestyle since 1998 and have done fine with it . i reduced my calories to 1800 ( i was formerly eating about 2200 ) . i was hungry for the first year , at times , during the day until my weight went very slowly ( less than a pound per 2 weeks ) down to my college weight , my body reached some kind of equilibrium and i stopped losing weight . i checked out my diet with a nutrition database to make sure that i was get adequate nutrition . since i was eating 11 servings of veg / fruit a day with plenty of legumes and nuts , my nutrient intake was outstanding including 50 grams of fiber and 60 grams of veg protein . my bio markers are fine including 149 total cholesterol , 78 ldl and 120 / 70 or lower blood pressure . 1800 calories of vegan food , as long as you exclude the usual vegan snacks like chips , sports bars , etc is really an enormous amount of veg / fruit / legumes and hunger is not an issue . most cr people , including those who eat animal protein , are actually eating a near vegan diet to to the enormous value placed on vegetable , fruit and legumes.these are all healthy foods . as joseph gonzales has mentioned above , leucine ( and also methionine , btw ) is an essential amino acid , and it needs to be consumed . while you shouldn ’ t be swimming in whey protein shakes ( whey protein is very high in leucine ) , a well-rounded plant-based diet is highly unlikely to result in a detrimental level of leucine , methionine , or any other animo acid . you ’ re certainly not cutting your life short by eating soybeans , lentils , peanuts , almonds , and walnuts — unless that ’ s the full extent of your daily diet.aventist study 2 result say that vegan live shortter lives than those who eat fish.not really . the mortality rates weren ’ t significantly distinguishable ( the mean for each cohort fell within

PLAIN-111	how to get kids to eat their vegetables what happens if we give one group of kids a plate of cookies and the other group the same number of cookies , but cut in half , and tell both groups they can eat as many as they want ? researchers reported that decreasing cookie size led to 25 % fewer cookie calories eaten . the goal of that study was to help counter obesity-promoting eating behaviors facilitated by the availability of large portions of junk food . the findings “ suggest that reducing the size of cookies ( without altering the total amount of food ) decreases children ’ s short-term caloric intake , ” a dietary strategy for parents to discreetly decrease unhealthy behaviors . but they were using sugar wafers – what ’ s in those things ? partially hydrogenated oil ( trans fats ) . what ’ s so bad about trans fats ? see trans fat in meat and dairy , trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero , and breast cancer survival and trans fat . no one should be eating those cookies . in fact , i can think of another “ dietary strategy ” to decrease kid ’ s intake — don ’ t give them any ! admittedly , this is easier said than done . even in the ‘ granola crunchy ’ san francisco bay area , a proposed ban on junk food suggested by parents and school administrators sent a faction of teachers into an apoplectic fit . in texas , there was so much parental outrage that they got lawmakers to pass a safe cupcake amendment . the amendment , known as lauren ’ s law , ensures that parents and grandparents of schoolchildren celebrating a birthday can bring whatever they want to school . fine . what if we just offered fruit in addition to the cupcakes at classroom celebrations ? in a study outlined in my video , tricks to get kids to eat healthier at school , researchers provided bowls of fresh , cut-up fruit in addition to the party food brought by the parents at two of four kindergarten or preschool celebrations to observe student response . no special effort was made to encourage students to choose the fruit : they just put it out there . would kids actually eat fruit when there was birthday cake , ice cream , and cheese puffs taking up nearly a whopping third of their daily caloric intake ? yes ! on average each kid ate a full fruit serving . take that , cheesy puffs ! there are entire curricula available now for schools , such as “ veggiecation , ” where for a whole year classrooms feature a new “ veggie of the month , ” sprinkled with nutrition mantras like ” fiber equals a happy tummy . ” and they work ! “ the active engagement of students in tasting and rating vegetable dishes seemed to have contributed to higher consumption of featured vegetables . ” one school was able in some cases to double vegetable consumption just by giving them attractive names . elementary students ate twice the number of carrots if they were called “ x-ray vision carrots , ” compared to when they were just “ carrots ” or generically named “ food of the day . ” how about “ power punch broccoli , silly dilly green beans , or tiny tasty tree tops ? ” selection of broccoli increased by 109.4 % , and green beans by 177 % . conclusion : “ these studies demonstrate that using an attractive name to describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective , persistent , and scalable with little or no money or experience . these names were not carefully crafted , discussed in focus groups , and then pre-tested . ” they just thought them up out of thin air . and kids were suckered into eating healthier for months by putting out silly little signs . in this school , vegetable intake was up nearly 100 % , while in the control school without signs , vegetable consumption started low and actually got worse . so why isn ’ t every single school in the country doing this right now ? ! bring it up at your next pta meeting . and if we want to get really bold , we can join the nutritious school lunch revolution led by pioneering organizations like the new york coalition for healthy school food ( check out their website at www.healthyschoolfood.org ) . whenever i find myself frustrated by half measures , i am forced to remind myself just how sad the standard american diet is . see nation ‘ s diet in crisis for a reality check . one of the problems is that parents may not even realize there is a problem ( mothers overestimate dietary quality ) . for more healthy eating tricks check out : tricks to get kids to eat healthier at home and tricks to get adults to eat healthier . i ’ d be interested in contacting schools who had this veggiecation . anyone know of any schools ? hi june , check out their website and / or locate a veggiecator : http : / / www.veggiecation.com / dr greger i want you to be more straightforward . cutting food into smaller pieces , a dietary strategy for parents to decrease “ unhealthy behaviors ” is really taking advantage of more surface area to decrease “ overeating ” ! i think you must always describe what you mean when by “ healthy ” or “ unhealthy ” behavior . strategies to decrease calorie consumption or to limit overeating just sounds less judgmental and is easier for people to understand . dr greger your videos and blogs get better every day . thanksthe amendment , known as lauren ’ s law , ensures that parents and grandparents of schoolchildren celebrating a birthday can bring whatever they want to school. http : / / 0rz.tw / 9biiyread kids the mitch spinach children ’ s book series . learn how to get superpowers from eating fruits and veggies ! how about making the vegetables more tasty , not with sugar , but with cooking ?

PLAIN-122	citrus to reduce muscle fatigue the lactic acid that makes yogurt tangy is the same lactic acid that builds up in our muscles when we exercise strenuously . instead of bacteria fermenting the sugar in milk to make energy for themselves , our muscles ferment sugar in our diet to produce energy to contract . if , like when we ’ re sprinting , lactic acid builds up in our muscles faster than it can be removed we can end up with a burning sensation in our muscles , forcing us to stop . now if we train , we can increase the number of blood vessels in our muscles and clear out the lactate faster . for example , when researchers took some overweight sedentary women and started them on an aerobic training program of running and walking , at the end of three months , their lactate levels during exercise dropped 17 % . but those on the same program who drank two cups of orange juice a day dropped their levels 27 % . they did the same exercise program , but the citrus group experienced a significant decrease in blood lactate concentration , indicating an improvement in physical performance with less muscle fatigue . i don ’ t recommend drinking juice , though , because we ’ re losing all that wonderful fiber that slows the rate of fruit sugar absorption into our system . in my video , reducing muscle fatigue with citrus , we can see the blood sugar spike one might expect after drinking coca-cola . compare that to the spike we see with orange juice ? no difference . however , if we eat the same quantity of sugar in the form of orange slices we experience a significantly smaller spike in blood sugar . so the whole fruit is nearly always better than fruit juice . now this is not to say oj isn ’ t better than coke . oj has those citrus phytonutrients like hesperidin , which may be why the women ’ s triglycerides didn ’ t go up even though they were drinking two cups of fruit juice every day . hesperidin may actually help lower our digestion of fats , but once we get up to three cups a day , we really can start bumping our triglycerides . the burning sensation during strenuous exercise may be related to the build-up of lactic acid in our muscles , but that ’ s different than the delayed onset muscle soreness that occurs in the days following a bout of extreme physical activity . that ’ s thought to be due to inflammation caused by muscle cell damage , little micro-tears in the muscle . if it ’ s an inflammatory reaction then might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help ? find out in my video reducing muscle soreness with berries . for more about what citrus phytonutrients can do can be found in my video , keeping your hands warm with citrus . what ’ s a good way the add citrus when oranges aren ’ t in season ( or you don ’ t like the mess of peeling fruit ) ? try cutting it into slices ! ! faster & not quite as messy : ) organic lemon juicehi , off topic : is there any clinical study about mastic gum ( hp treatment ) ? thanksoff topic : i ’ m curious about the healthiness of fermented foods such as sauerkraut . i have had to take antibiotics many times , and i make my own sauerkraut to boost my intestinal flora . should i continue with eating it regularly ? athletes , blood sugar , body fat , citrus , coca cola , dairy , exercise , fat , fatigue , fruit , grapefruit , hesperidin , lactic acid , lemons , limes , milk , muscle health , oranges , phytonutrients , sugar , triglycerides , yogurt - -

PLAIN-132	can we fight the blues with greens ? why does frequent consumption of vegetables appear to cut one ’ s odds of depression by more than half ? and “ frequent ” was defined as eating vegetables not 3 or more times a day , but just 3 or more times a week . a 2012 study was found that eliminating animal products improved mood within two weeks . the researchers blamed arachidonic acid , found primarily in chicken and eggs , which might adversely impact mental health via a cascade of brain inflammation . more on this inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid in : but better moods on plant-based diets could also be from the good stuff in plants — a class of phytonutrients that cross the blood brain barrier into our heads . a recent review in the journal , nutritional neuroscience , suggests that eating lots of fruits and vegetables “ may present a noninvasive natural and inexpensive therapeutic means to support a healthy brain . ” but how ? to understand the latest research , we need to understand the underlying biology of depression — the so-called monoamine theory of depression . it ’ s the idea that depression may arise out of a chemical imbalance in the brain . in my video fighting the blues with greens ? i run through an oversimplified version . one of the ways the billions of nerves in our brain communicate with one another is through chemical signals called neurotransmitters . two nerve cells don ’ t actually touch — there ’ s a physical gap between them . to bridge that gap , when one nerve wants to tap the other on the shoulder it releases chemicals into that gap , including three monoamines : serotonin , dopamine and norepinephrine . these neurotransmitters then float over to the other nerve to get its attention . the first nerve then sucks them back in to be reused the next time it wants to talk . it ’ s also constantly manufacturing more monoamines , and an enzyme , monoamine oxidase , is constantly chewing them up to maintain just the right amount . the way cocaine works is by acting as a monoamine re-uptake inhibitor . it blocks the first nerve from sucking back up these three chemicals and so there ’ s a constant tapping on the shoulder — constant signaling — to the next cell . amphetamines work in the same way but also increase the release of monoamines . ecstasy works like speed , but just causes comparatively more serotonin release . after awhile , the next nerve may say “ enough already ! ” and down-regulate its receptors to turn down the volume . it puts in earplugs . so we need more and more of the drug to get the same effect , and then when we ’ re not on the drug we may feel crappy because normal volume transmission just isn ’ t getting through . antidepressants are thought to work along similar mechanisms . people who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of monoamine oxidase in their brain . that ’ s the enzyme that breaks down those neurotransmitters . in the video mentioned previously , i show the levels of monoamine oxidase in the brains of depressed individuals versus healthy individuals . if the levels of our neurotransmitter-eating enzyme is elevated , then our levels of neurotransmitters drops , and we become depressed ( or so the theory goes ) . so a number of different classes of drugs have been developed . the tricyclic antidepressants , named because they have three rings like a tricycle , appear to block norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake , and so even though our enzymes may be eating these up at an accelerated rate , what gets released sticks around longer . then there were the ssris ( the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ) like prozac . now we know what that means — they just block the re-uptake of serotonin . then there are drugs that just block the re-uptake of norepinephrine , or block dopamine re-uptake , or a combination . but if the problem is too high levels of monoamine oxidase , why not just block the enzyme ? make a monoamine oxidase inhibitor . they did , but monoamine oxidase inhibitors are considered drugs of last resort because of serious side effects — not the least of which is the dreaded “ cheese effect , ” where eating certain foods while on the drug can have potentially fatal consequences . if only there was a way to dampen the activity of this enzyme without the whole bleed-into-our-brain-and-die thing . now we can finally talk about the latest theory as to why fruits and vegetables may improve our mood . there are inhibitors of the depression-associated enzyme in various plants . there are phytonutrients in spices , such as clove , oregano , cinnamon , and nutmeg , that inhibit monoamine oxidase , but people don ’ t eat enough spices to get enough into the brain . a certain dark green leafy has a lot , but its name is tobacco , which may actually be one of the reasons cigarettes make smokers feel so good . ok , but what if we don ’ t want brain bleeds or lung cancer ? well , there is a phytonutrient found in apples , berries , grapes , kale , onions , and green tea that may indeed affect our brain biology enough to improve our mood , which may help explain why those eating plant-based diets tend to have superior mental health . for other natural treatments for mental illness , check out : this is fascinating . once again a one minute eduction improves my resolves to eat the right things ( plants ) and eschew the wrong things ( animals ) . thank you ! i live in seattle so there ’ s a constant fight with weather-related mood issues to add to whatever you bring . the lowering or stopping of meat eating does seem to make mood less solidly grey . i am wondering if some of it is chemistry ( you need lots of acid to digest it ) . and possibly some is also blood flow reduction ( the saturated fat ) . there can be good effects on mood from taking nitric oxide supplements such as arginine-citrulline formulas , and neo40 lozenges . i ’ m over 40 so have to take both of these to get an effect . but comparing these supplements to antidepressants , these supplements affected a larger area of energy in the body than just the brain – they pour the life back into everything , it seems to me . so if you examine spinach and beets , two outstanding sources of nitrates , there ’ s strong direct chemical creation of nitric oxide from plant-derived nitrates . nitrates become nitrites from action of bacteria in saliva , then pass on to the acidic stomach and become nitric oxide right there . but nitrates also are recycled from gut back to the saliva in an endless loop . this is the backup mechanism for older people whose arterial linings are shot and can ’ t make nitric oxide from arginine as would younger people . the use of both arginine and sodium nitrite supplements like neo40 ( neogenis.com ) effectively raises my nitric oxide levels to a good high target range in just a day or two , with great effect on mood and energy levels . it ’ s really quite amazing . but … i also include beets and greens in fairly steady amounts through the week , higher than the average american by far would probably eat . i juice them and blend them , etc . the turmeric supplement can elevate mood for me , also , but not provide much energy release in the body . it ’ s got some benefits so i add that too ! : ) kaniwaplease post info about kaniwa or chenopodium pallidicaule , this was featured on dr. oz . how much phytates does it have ?

PLAIN-1330	health food stores health food stores are great resources for those eating healthy diets , but not everything there is good for us . in the beverage department , one might want to steer clear of kombucha tea and mangosteen juice . be careful with licorice since just a moderate intake can compromise kidney function . while blue-green algae and spirulina ( see videos here , here , here , here ) have potential benefits , they may contain potent toxins which damage muscles , the brain , and the liver . no such toxins have been found in chlorella , but green leafy vegetables provides many of the same nutrients for less money . also good for you : goji berries are full of antioxidants , rose hips may ease arthritis pain , and broccoli sprouts are a very inexpensive health food . and be sure to stock up on whole grains , which help maintain healthy body weight and slow the progression of atherosclerosis . one might want to take the advice of health food store employees with a grain of himalayan pink salt ( see here , here , here , and here ) .see also the related blog post : health food store advice : often worthless or worst - alternative medicine , complementary medicine , supplements , snake oil , liver health , herbs , nausea , nutrition myths , cost savings , pregnancy , side effects , bargains , women 's health , brain health , cancer - -

PLAIN-1352	herbs some of the earliest populations have called upon the medicinal benefits of herbs to treat a variety of ailments . herbs have some of the highest antioxidants levels . just a dash of herbs has the power to reduce inflammation and may even protect against dna damage ( see also here ) . combining herbs can increase their benefits by boosting the bioavailability of some of the compounds they contain.hydroponic basil may be richer in antioxidants than soil-grown basil due to the higher amount of stress the plant is placed under . pregnant women should be wary of feverfew and black cohosh , which was surprisingly recommended at health food stores . when it comes to herbs , however , it is best to stay away from retail supplement suppliers as their claims as recommendations , and ingredients are often unreliable and may be dangerous . in the case of ayurvedic medicine , it may even be contaminated with lead and other heavy metals . - spices , complementary medicine , antioxidants , alternative medicine , dna damage , cancer , inflammation , oxidative stress , supplements , phytonutrients , heart disease , heart health , liver health , turmeric , tea - -

PLAIN-142	dealing with air travel radiation exposure doctors appear to be causing tens of thousands of cancers with ct scans and dentists may be causing a few brain tumors with dental x-rays ( see my two videos cancer risk from ct scan radiation and do dental x-rays cause brain tumors ? ) , but what about these new-fangled airport full-body scanners that use so-called backscatter technology to reduce x-ray exposure ? a thousand times less radiation exposure than a chest x-ray , though they ’ re still being phased out . in fact , flight passengers may get 100 times more radiation during the flight every hour , because they ’ re so high up in the atmosphere and exposed to more cosmic rays . does that mean a round-trip cross-country flight is almost like getting a chest x-ray ? yes . anyone who ’ s seen my speaking schedule knows i ’ m totally screwed . but what can you do ? as is the answer to so many health questions , you can eat healthily . high dietary antioxidant intakes are associated with decreased dna damage in airline pilots . note the word “ dietary . ” antioxidant supplements didn ’ t work . no benefit was found for those taking multivitamins , vitamin c pills , or vitamin e pills . but those getting the most vitamin c from food , b carotene from food , cryptoxanthin from food , and lutein / zeaxanthin from food , saw a significant decrease in dna damage . the usda keeps a nice list of phytonutrient resources . cryptoxanthin sources listed here ( healthy pumpkin pie anyone ? ) . lutein and zeaxanthin can help us prevent glaucoma and see 27 miles farther and may present a dietary prevention of age-related macular degeneration . are these eyesight-saving phytonutrients also found in eggs ? you might be surprised . see egg industry blind spot . for more on why produce is generally preferable to pills , check out : these are all phytonutrients , of course , so when they say food , they really mean plants . and because antioxidants can have synergistic effects , the greatest protection was found when they were eating a combination of phytonutrients , so the greatest protection was found in those eating the citrus and broccoli and nuts and seeds and pumpkins and peppers and dark green leafy vegetables . though if one had to pick , greens may be the best . all this time i ’ ve been packing kale chips on planes as a snack just because they ’ re so lightweight , but now i know their dual purpose . the researchers conclude that a diet consisting of a variety of fruits and vegetables provides a natural source of these antioxidants as well as other potential protective factors , which may offer the best protection against cumulative dna damage associated with ionizing radiation exposure . the results are especially relevant to flight crews , astronauts , and frequent flyers . the same thing was found following hiroshima and nagasaki atomic bomb survivors for decades . models based on the available data suggest that the cancer risk in exposed persons may have been knocked down by daily green and yellow vegetable consumption from about 50 % increased cancer risk to only about 30 % increased risk . similar results were found for fruit consumption . so fruit and vegetable consumption can diminish , but not eliminate the risks of radiation . same thing was found following children after chernobyl . i profile a study in my video mediating radiation exposure from airline travel in which consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits was found to afford protection to the immune systems of exposed children , whereas egg and fish consumption was associated with significantly increased risk of chromosome damage within their bodies . researchers were unsure whether the damage attributed to fish and eggs was because the eggs and fish carried radioactivity , or whether it was just from the animal fat intake alone . why might eggs be harmful even if not radioactive ? see who says eggs aren ’ t healthy or safe ? or my other 58 videos on eggs . i cover natural and artificial radioactivity in fish in fukushima and radioactivity in seafood and explore concerns about other pollutants in my 89 fish videos . does food absorb radiation up that high in the sky ? in-flight eating maybe not good idea ? … .. maybe prior to flight , post flight eating only ? the type of radiation we ’ re exposed to in an airplane is not radioactive particles that things absorb , it ’ s electromagnetic waves , aka radiation . so , sure , the food gets hit by radiation , and sure , that radiation can cause “ damage ” to the cells in the food . but the food isn ’ t contaminated with radiation , it ’ s merely been hit by it . only by hanging around fission reactions can actual radioactive particles be absorbed.seems to me that we should not be bringing any food ( kale chips included ) onto the plane . same goes with supplements . if our bodies absorb radiation , why would these “ small little bodies ” of food . and then we eat ‘ this ’ food ? does seem prudent . i ’ m going to indulge in antioxidant rich foods pre-flight and when i land . same might go for water.the type of radiation we ’ re exposed to in an airplane is not radioactive particles that things absorb , it ’ s electromagnetic waves , aka radiation . so , sure , the food gets hit by radiation , and sure , that radiation can cause “ damage ” to the cells in the food . but the food isn ’ t contaminated with radiation , it ’ s merely been hit by it . only by hanging around fission reactions can actual radioactive particles be absorbeddr g good idea on kale chips … i think ? i just looked in whole foods and the only brand i could find , name starts with a “ r ” , is about 40 % fat . what brand did you select ? where did you buy ? thanksyou should just make your own : - ) . it ’ s pretty easy if you have an oven or dehydrator . tastes better too.i too am concerned about bringing food onto a plane . it does make sense that if the human body absorbs radiation , then the avocado , the baby food , the breast milk , … .all the goodies i bring with me up in the air … .. all this stuff absorbs the radiation as well . makes me think the first things i should do when the plane lands is throw it all in the trash.interesting ! has anyone done a study on pilots and stewards / stewardess and their risk of cancer ?

PLAIN-152	how probiotics affect mental health before thorazine was invented in 1950 , mental illness was often treated surgically . in fact , in 1949 the inventor of the lobotomy was awarded the nobel prize . before tens of thousands were lobotomized , however , colectomy was all the rage . there was a theory that bad bacteria in the gut ­ was the cause of mental illness . so the cure was to surgically remove the colon . yes , the surgery killed about one in three – but when they didn ’ t die , surgeons claimed positive results . some , for example , bragged that when they resected the colons of schoolchildren as a preventive measure there was a cessation of “ abnormal sex practices ” like masturbation ( which was viewed at the time as a precursor for mental illness later in life ) . reminds me of the mastectomies they used to perform for menstrual breast pain ( plant-based diets for breast pain ) . others , though , suggested a less drastic approach , proposing that one could instead treat this “ intestinal putrefaction ” by changing the intestinal flora . indeed , over a century ago there were reports of successfully treating psychiatric illnesses like depression with a dietary regimen that included probiotics . doctors perceived a connection between depression and “ feces deficient in quantity and moisture and very offensive in odor . ” reportedly , after the probiotic regimen not only did people feel better psychologically , but they had their “ feces increase in quantity , become softer , and of regular consistency , and the offensive smell diminish … . ” concurrent with the probiotics , however , all patients were started on a vegetarian diet — so it may not have been the probiotics at all . why might the vegetarian diet alone have improved mood ? check out my videos plant-based diet & mood and the follow-up improving mood through diet as well as my serotonin series starting with human neurotransmitters in plants . this entire field of inquiry remained dormant for about a hundred years , but a new discipline has recently emerged known as enteric ( meaning intestinal ) neuroscience . our enteric nervous system — the collection of nerves in our gut — has been referred to as a “ second brain ” given its size , complexity , and similarity . we have as many nerves in our gut as we do in our spinal cord ! the size and complexity of our gut brain is not surprising when considering the challenges posed by the interface . we have a hundred times more contact with the outside world through our gut than through our skin . we also have to deal with our 100 trillion little friends down there . that takes a lot of processing power . anyone who ’ s had butterflies in their stomach knows that our mental state can affect our gut . studies show that every day stresses can actually affect gut flora populations . an innovative study out of australia looked at feces scraped from toilet paper used by undergrads during exam week . if you check out my 5-min video gut feelings : probiotics and mental health , you can see how many bacteria the undergrads had in their feces before and after the exam . you ’ ll notice the effect lasted the whole week . their findings show that our mental state can indeed affect our gut , but can our gut affect our mental state ? we didn ’ t know until recently . many suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome complain of gut dysfunction , so researchers tried giving sufferers probiotics to see if their mental and emotional state could be improved and it did appear to help . you can learn more about treating chronic fatigue syndrome in : what about for healthy people , though ? a study entitled “ assessment of the psychotropic properties of probiotics ” marked a turning point in our thinking . researchers found that one month of probiotics appeared to significantly decrease symptoms of anxiety , depression , anger and hostility . until that study was published , the idea that probiotic bacteria administered to the intestine could influence the brain seemed almost surreal – like science-fiction . well , science yes , but maybe not fiction . might people suffering from certain forms of mental health problems benefit from a fecal transplant from someone with more happy-go-lucky bacteria ? we don ’ t know , but this apparent ability of probiotics to affect brain processes is one of the most exciting recent developments in probiotic research . gut feelings : probiotics and mental health closes out my 4-part video series on the latest in probiotic science . i started with the two most established indications for their use in preventing and treating diarrhea with probiotics , then moved onto a more speculative use in preventing the common cold with probiotics ? , and then offered practical advice on how to best take probiotic supplements in should probiotics be taken before , during , or after meals ? what else might our good bacteria be doing for us ? they may help with weight control ( fawning over flora and gut flora & obesity ) and serve up anti-cancer compounds ! ( flax and fecal flora and sometimes the enzyme myth is true ) . is it possible that certain plant-based foods are causing certain mental health issues ? dr. greger , your good friend dr. mcdougall claims on his website that dairy and gluten-grains have been found to cause schizophrenia . he states this very clearly.could these gluten-grains be altering the gastrointestinal tract , compromising the integrity of the proper bacteria … .. thus allowing the problem in the first place ? my mental health changed for the better when i eliminated 100 percent of gluten grains , dairy , and eggs … with grains ( in all forms , actually ) being the worst offender . … .getting rid of red meat , poultry , and most fish helped as well . a simple diet of raw and cooked vegetables , raw fruit , raw nuts , some beans , occasional shellfish … .. has changed things for the better.do you have a vegan probiotic that you recommend ? jjv2 : lots of people swear by water kafir . you can read about it on-line , buy the crystals and grow it yourself . if taken care of , it lasts indefinitely . i can ’ t attest to its effectiveness myself . but it sounds better than anything else out there that i have seen.another option is rejuvalac . i have made rejuvalac myself several times . it ’ s not all that tasty by itself , but it makes great nut cheese . and i understand that it is also a natural probiotic . just something else for you to consider / research.good luck.dr. greger – wondering if you have any research supporting the use of probiotics to help children with spectrum disorders ? http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2015 / 06 / 28 / magazine / can-the-bacteria-in-your-gut-explain-your-mood.html ? action = click & contentcollection = opinion & module = mostemailed & version = full & region = marginalia & src = me & pgtype = article has more details of current research. anger , anxiety , bacteria , bowel movements , colectomy , colon , constipation , depression , emotional health , enteric nervous system , enteric neuroscience , fecal transplant , fibromyalgia , gut dysfunction , gut flora , intestinal flora , intestinal putrefaction , lobotomy , mastectomy , mental health , mental illness , mood , plant-based diet , probiotics , psychiatric illness , thorazine , vegan , vegetarian - -
PLAIN-1526	liver cancer major causes of liver cancer are diseases such as hepatitis and consuming too much alcohol . but there are plenty of ways to help lower our risk of liver cancer by dietary means . eating broccoli , cranberries , lemons , amla , walnuts and pecans may lower our risk of liver cancer and cancer in general , as may increasing the amount of phytates in our blood , which are most commonly found in whole-foods such as beans , nuts and grains . recently , coffee has been shown to decrease the liver cancer risk of those that consume alcohol by 50 % ( but simply not drinking alcohol is a better solution ! ) . sea vegetables may also suppress the risk of liver cancer , but be wary of their iodine content and avoid hiziki ( or hijiki ) seaweed and spirulina . lastly , it ’ s best to avoid added sugars , such as high fructose corn syrup and table sugar , as that can lead to fat build-up in our livers . - cancer , breast cancer , liver health , mortality , rectal cancer , liver disease , colon cancer , pancreatic cancer , fruit , antioxidants , alcohol , smoking , oral cancer , breast health , vegans - -

i have done videos about studies that make the headlines , but i think my most important role is to showcase studies that would otherwise never see the light of day . the reason we don ’ t see ads on tv for broccoli is the same reason we don ’ t hear about the vast majority of published research – there ’ s no profit motive . it may not make anyone money , but what if our lives would profit ?

it may have been a dcma take-down request if a video inappropriately referenced third-party product or other protected / copyrighted material . at any rate , it should have just been the one video , so the whole-account shutdown smacks of something related to “ terms of service ” violation.it could also have been related to anything related to discussing farts , stools , or sexual function ( ed ) , or other “ graphic medical material ” , which to some people is emotionally inseparable from porn.might want to read through it and see if there is anything in your videos that could be interpreted as violating the native terms of service.citing published research in a video you offer for free to the public does not violate dmca by any stretch of the imagination.so sorry for the trouble you tube has given you . you certainly don ’ t deserve it . happy to help what i can to keep this going strong.wholly ridiculous . possibly “ weeks ” to get turned around ? good grief , youtube … hmmm , smells like dirty rotten tricks to me . i hope the party or parties submitting these “ complaints ” to youtube are identified . now i ’ m guessing that would be some baaaaaad pr.i just sent feedback to youtube asking for reinstatement of nutritionfacts.org and i will continue to do so every day until it ’ s restored . youtube users if you want to do the same , click this link to get to the youtube page and click “ send feedback ” at the bottom of the page. http : / / www.youtube.com / channel / ucddn8duxydgjz3qr5mjadtadonedone ! ! ! done . ridiculous.donation complete . this site has done a lot of good for a lot of people . don ’ t let this lone ( of course , along with a few notable others ) voice in the wilderness be silenced ! youtube is a tricky beast . i decoupled my youtube account from my google identity and now i can ’ t create playlists , comment , vote up comments , add to existing playlists ( except watch later ) . google is trying to exert complete control – reminds me of monsanto and their seeds that blow into neighboring fields ! donating asap . don ” t worry dr ! keep it going ! ! other doctors like myself use you as a resource for patients ! just donated.finally donated. with the absurd amount of nutritional misinformation out there , this site is just too important to lose.donated ! i am happy to do so considering the incredible wealth of nutritional information provided here ! ! i review the daily videos , and love how you can search on almost any topic and get scientific answers for various common nutritional questions ! if everybody does a little , nobody has to do a lot … i just posted on youtube ’ s facebook page . would you do the same or post on youtube ’ s twitter ?

PLAIN-1655	mortality in the us , there is a one in two chance of dying from heart disease . most people admitted to hospitals for heart attacks have “ normal ” cholesterol levels though ; this suggests the current recommendations are not stringent enough ( see here , here , here , here , here ) . a plant-based diet appears to reduce heart disease risk ( see also here ) and may improve lung function in copd patients . eating just one handful of nuts a day , for example , may cut the risk of dying from heart disease in half . the pritikin , ornish , and essylstein low-fat plant-based dietary programs have been found to even reverse heart disease ( see also here , here , here , here , here , here ) .also thought to possibly extend one ’ s lifespan : vitamin d supplements ( see also here , here , here , here , here ) , seven hours of sleep per night , again , eating a plant-based diet ( see also here ) , severe caloric restriction , a single serving of berries every day , and coffee.thought to shorten one ’ s lifespan : vitamin e supplements ( see also here ) , eating just one egg a day ( see also here ) , meat intake ( see also here , here , here ) , iron pills , early puberty , untreated celiac disease , kombucha tea , prescription drugs ( which kill an estimated 106,000 people in the us each year ) , and a meat-based low carb diet . and the following appear to have no effect on lifespan : vitamin c pills , multivitamins , and moderate alcohol consumption in healthy people.in terms of cancer mortality , lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of women in the us , but breast cancer the most common . women with breast cancer who eat soy may cut their risk of dying and recurrence . broccoli has been shown to improve survival rates among bladder cancer patients and lignans from flax seeds improve survival rates among breast cancer patients . saturated fat and trans fat intake have been shown to lower breast cancer survival rates . dietary fat of animal origin has been associated with increased pancreatic cancer risk.when japanese men die , many have tiny prostate tumors ; but they often die with their cancer , not from their cancer , which is not the case in the united states . also , various types of cancer occurrence and mortality rates are higher in poultry workers , when compared to the general population . one possible explanation for this is that people with high exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses may have increased risk for dying from several cancers and neurological diseases.the top killers in the us now include alzheimer ’ s disease . saffron as well as apples and ginger may slow down the progression of alzheimer ’ s.other dangers to watch out for : generally the first and only symptom of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is a painful death ; eating meat just a few times a month increases the risk ( see here , here ) . death rates from liver failure have been found to be even more closely related to pork consumption than to alcohol consumption . sudden infant death syndrome is the leading cause of death for healthy infants after one month of age and has been associated with maternal cow ’ s milk consumption.doctors prescribe diabetes drugs regularly even though they may increase the risk of death ; cinnamon has also been found to help with blood sugar , but without such side-effects . triphala has been found to preferentially wipe out breast and pancreatic cancer cells ; unfortunately , it has been found to be contaminated with lead . - cancer , meat , beans , fruit , vegetables , plant-based diets , medications , cardiovascular health , heart health , heart disease , cardiovascular disease , animal products , africa , eggs , greens - -

PLAIN-174	cinnamon for diabetes the use of cinnamon to help treat diabetes remains controversial . we know that cinnamon is so good at controlling one ’ s blood sugar that you can cheat on a diabetes test by consuming two teaspoons of cinnamon the night before your glucose tolerance test . that ’ s where they make you drink some sugar water to see how well your body can keep your blood sugar levels under control , and if you eat those two teaspoons right when the test starts or 12 hours before you can significantly blunt the spike . even a teaspoon a day appears to make a significant difference . a review of the best studies done to date found that the intake of cinnamon by type 2 diabetics or prediabetics does lower their blood glucose significantly . so what ’ s the controversy ? well , as i described in my video the safer cinnamon , cassia cinnamon , also known as chinese cinnamon ( probably what you ’ re getting at the store if it just says “ cinnamon ” ) contains a compound called coumarin which may be toxic to the liver at high doses . originally the concern was mainly for kids during christmas-time where they might get an above average exposure , but more recently some researchers suggest that kids just sprinkling some cassia cinnamon on their oatmeal a few times a week might exceed the recommended safety limit . as you can see in my 5-min video update on cinnamon for blood sugar control just a quarter teaspoon of cinnamon a few times a week may be too much for little kids , and if they ’ re eating that cinnamon-sprinkled oatmeal more like every day they can bump up against the limit for adults . so a teaspoon a day of cassia cinnamon might be too much for anyone , but can ’ t we just switch from cassia cinnamon to ceylon cinnamon and get the benefits without the potential risks ? without the risks , yes , but we ’ re no longer so sure about the benefits . nearly all of the studies showing blood sugar benefits of cinnamon have been done on cassia . we ’ ve just assumed that the same would apply for the safer cinnamon , ceylon , but only recently was it put to the test . that nice blunting of blood sugars we saw in response to cassia cinnamon disappeared when the researchers tried ceylon cinnamon instead . in fact , it may actually be the potentially toxic coumarin that was the active ingredient in the cassia cinnamon all along . thus , sidestepping the toxin by switching may sidestep the benefit . so should we just give up on going out of our way to add cinnamon to our diet ? no , i think it ’ s still a good idea to shoot for a teaspoon a day of ceylon cinnamon since there are a bunch of other benefits linked to cinnamon besides blood sugar control , not the least of which is it ’ s potent antioxidant content ( as i show in my one of my favorite videos antioxidants in a pinch ) . in my superfood bargains video , where i rank foods in terms of antioxidants per unit cost , cinnamon comes out as one of the cheapest food sources of antioxidants , beating out cloves and coming in just under purple cabbage . what about the oxalates in cinnamon ? not a problem , but the oxalates in too much turmeric may be a concern . as you ’ re making a healthy pumpkin pie with all that cinnamon , don ’ t accidentally add too much nutmeg , though , the subject of my follow-up video don ’ t eat too much nutmeg . ultimately cinnamon can no longer be considered a safe and effective treatment for diabetes . either you ’ re using cassia cinnamon , and it ’ s effective , but may not be safe , or you ’ re using ceylon cinnamon , which is safe , but does not appear effective . note that even the cassia cinnamon only brought down blood sugars modestly ( in other words , only as good as the leading diabetes drug in the world , metformin , sold as glucophage ) . so yes , it may work as good as the leading drug , but that ’ s not saying much . the best way to treat diabetes is to attempt to cure it completely , reversing diabetes with a healthy diet . books i would recommend ( in order of publication ) are defeating diabetes , dr. neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes , and the end of diabetes . i talk more about the potential potency of plants in general in power plants and more about spices in particular in videos such as : amla versus diabetes explores the use of indian gooseberries as a way to help control blood sugar , though , again , the best way to deal with diabetes is to prevent and treat it with a healthy diet . nice article doc . reminds me of other natural elements like arsenic that are toxic or therapudic depending on dosagedear doctor g. love you dude , don ’ t ever stop . one suggestion , please label your postings , like this one , as re-post ( unchanged ) , revised ( updated ) , or new . this way i will know that i ’ m not having a seizure ( deja vu ) , but rather just reading something important , again.it seems like he may be intentionally trying to have each “ blog ” as a video and as an article . i think it ’ s nice to reiterate some older points.i understand that cinnamon can cause your platelet count to go down . if you have a low platelet count , this could be dangerous.thank you for this life-transforming and energizing site , dr. gregger ! our friends and we use cost co ’ s saigon cinnamon and cannot find any called ceylon . any new tests to see if saigon is ok ? any tips for online or marin county ca sources ? hey gayle , if you would like to purchase locally , whole foods sells organic ceylon ( a.k.a. “ true ” or sweet ) cinnamon for $ 22.99-24.99 / lb in the bulk section where all the herbs and spices are located . if you would like to purchase online , vitacost , mountainroseherbs , and amazon may be a few options to check out.thank you , minh ! i had been told whole foods did not have ceylon ! i should have looked to verify . thank you for your help ! hi dr greger , do you have a way to donate directly through paypal without logging into google ? the donation setup makes me a little nervous.hey phil , click “ donate ” at the top of the nutritionfacts.org homepage . then , click where it says “ click here ” under the donations & tax receipts on the right side . from this webpage , you have the choice of either logging into your paypal account or using a credit card to donate ( at the bottom left where it says “ don ’ t have a paypal account ? ” ) . hope this helps ! going vegan a year ago got rid of my diabetes , so i know your massage is correct , thanks for all your hard work.i have seen studies saying that it is only the cassia that has the blood sugar lowering ability and not the other ! exactly ! but cassia is the one that is harmful . cons outweigh the pros for cassia. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / update-on-cinnamon-for-blood-sugar-control / please note that coumarin , the toxic component in cassia cinnamon , is oil soluable . simply preparing cassia cinnamon as a tea ( hot water infusion ) will leave the bad stuff behind , and preserve the benefits . just use a mini-coffe maker , with a non-bleached paper filter , put a teaspoon of cassia right in the filter section , and enjoy . sometimes simple solutions ( pun ! ) can be best.good article . i like the angle of the discussion focusing on the two kinds of cinnamon which is seldom discussed in other posts antioxidants , blood sugar , cassia cinnamon , ceylon cinnamon , children ’ s health , chinese cinnamon , cinnamon , coumarin , diabetes , glucophage , glucose tolerance , indian gooseberries , liver , liver disease , liver health , metformin , nutmeg , oxalates , plant-based diet , toxins , vegan , vegetarian , youth health - -

PLAIN-185	the best nutrition bar there are a variety of healthier fruit and nut bars on the market now that boast dried fruit as a primary ingredient . dried fruit is calorically dense , though . should we be concerned that eating such bars may make us fat ? you may have noticed in the conclusion of the fig study i covered in best dried fruit for cholesterol that adding 14 figs to people ’ s daily diets did not lead to significant weight gain . wait a second . that ’ s 300 calories of figs a day . over 5 weeks that ’ s 10,000 calories . how did 10,000 calories disappear into thin air ? figs are so satiating and packed with fiber that even without trying people just end up eating less of other foods throughout the day . i get full just thinking about eating 14 figs ! was that study just a fluke ? let ’ s look at the other new studies i covered . what about adding three quarters of a cup of dried apples to our diet every day for a year ? two hundred extra calories a day , but no significant change in weight . two hundred extra calories of prunes a day for a year ? no significant change in weight and same thing with a month of a daily 300 calorie load of dates . in general , the 5-10 % of americans that average a tablespoon or more of dried fruit a day tend to be less overweight , less obese , and have a slimmer waist with less abdominal obesity . they tended to eat more , but weighed less . similar findings were found for those that eat nuts and nut butters , lower body mass index , slimmer waist , and significantly less excess weight and obesity . see my video nuts and obesity : the weight of evidence . the various mechanisms are summarized in solving the mystery of the missing calories and explored further in a four-video series : what if you put dried fruit and nuts together ? what would be the effect of adding daily fruit and nut bars on top of one ’ s regular diet for two months ? researchers took about a hundred folks who were overweight and randomized them into two groups . half ate their regular diet , and the other half ate their regular diet plus two fruit and nut bars a day , totaling an extra 340 calories . but these weren ’ t candy calories ; these were largely whole plant food calories , dried fruits and nuts . two daily fruit and nut bars for two months did not cause weight gain . and they had additional sugar in them ( they were kind brand bars ) . maybe that may be why the participants ’ cholesterol didn ’ t get better despite the nuts , which should have helped . i highlight some brands in my 3-min video do fruit & nut bars cause weight gain ? with no added sugar , but it ’ s even cheaper to just concoct one ’ s own trail mix and eat dried fruits and nuts on their own . i ’ m hoping prominent nutritional biochemist bruce ames releases his nutrient dense chori-bar in a vegan formulation . the chori-bar was designed by the ames lab and usda food scientists to ameliorate nutritional deficiencies in children at risk , and has some novel innovations , but alas the current formulations use whey protein as a binding agent.the story of the chori-bar the research the patentanother great article , but i have an editing suggestion on this sentence : ” maybe that may be why the … ” instead try , “ that could be the reason why the … ” : ) try “ that could be why … ” abdominal obesity , almond butter , caloric density , cholesterol , dried apples , dried fruit , figs , fruit , nut bar , nut butter , nutrition bar , nuts , obesity , peanut butter , satiety , weight gain , weight loss - -

PLAIN-195	why are children starting puberty earlier ? early onset of puberty is considered a risk factor for a number of diseases in adulthood , including hormone-related cancers , a shorter lifespan , metabolic syndrome , and cardiovascular disease . the conventional thinking has been that the age of puberty has been getting earlier and earlier because our children have been getting fatter and fatter . however , european kids are also getting heavier , yet there has not been a steady decline in puberty onset ( see graphs here ) . so it may be less about how much kids are eating and more about what they ’ re eating . the most consistent link between diet and premature puberty has been found to be animal protein consumption . every gram of daily animal protein intake — that ’ s just like the weight of a paperclip — has been associated with a 17 % increase in the risk of girls starting their periods earlier than age 12 . why this link between animal protein and premature puberty ? we know meat increases the level of igf-1 and that alone is associated with early onset puberty . if you ’ re not familiar with insulin-like growth factor 1 , i have a series of videos about the growth hormone ( though mostly in relation to cancer risk ) . see , for example , the answer to the pritikin puzzle and cancer-proofing mutation . the early onset of puberty in girls associated with animal protein consumption may also be due to endocrine disrupting chemical pollutants in the meat supply . watch my 4-min video protein , puberty , and pollutants . for more videos on premature puberty see : i talk more about endocrine disrupting chemicals in particular in : it is said that besides the above mentioned consequences of early onset of puberty another big problem would be that maids won ’ t grow in length more than one more year after menarche . afterwards they wouldn ’ t grow any more . if this happens when being for instance only 11 years old , it could lead to a pretty short body length . is there any science behind this ? i ’ d regard this point as very important as maids soon become women and if they will have health problems in the distant future it is bad indeed , but if they don ’ t even enjoy a happy life until they get sick it is even worse – their love life and happiness would be affected.yes it is true that menarche permanently stunts the growth. which one of the worst reasons why artificially early menarche is so bad.at the time of the revolutionary war , the average of menarche ( when a girl gets her first period ) was about 17 . around the 1900 ’ s , in america , the average age was about 14 to 15 . currently it is about 11-14 , but girls as young as 9 can get their periods now . moreover , we are seeing signs of the start of puberty … .hair under the arms , pubic hair , etc in girls as young as 6 . it is due to the increased saturated fat in their diet . the more periods a girl has in her lifetime , the higher her risk of breast , uterine , and ovarian cancer . plus , early menarche robs girls of their childhood.i am now 72 , but my peers and i entered puberty at age 11 . today , many physicians are seeing signs of puberty in little girls age 3 and 4.there is zero evidence to support this . in fact , there is no evidence to support that saturated fat is harmful at all . the biggest heart study in the world found saturated fat and cholesterol to be protective ! there is however , substantial evidence that all the soy , growth hormones and xenoestrogens in everything all around us are huge factors in our health . i ’ d start there.actually , i agree with padma , being another person that actually works with patients , i have helped deliver babies from 12 yr olds . we are seeing children as young as 8 yrs old in puberty. this was not common in the 70 ’ s when i began practice . and btw , there is no legitimate study i have ever seen that says saturated fat is protective , it is eb knowledge that saturated fat is very inflammatory and destructive to the inner lining of our arteries , that includes brain , heart , kidneys … i don ’ t think either saturated fat or soy are the problem . there are societies that eat tons of saturated fat ( mongolians , turkish herding peoples , the arctic peoples , herding peoples in africa , and traditionally some native americans ) who never had early puberty problems . on the other side of the coin , you have chinese , japanese , korean , and other east asian peoples who ate a ton of soy and rarely consumed animal protein ( they called soy “ the meat without a bone ” ) and they also did not have problems with early puberty. what is causing early puberty is the massive influx of petrochemicals into everyday life of so many , from the food made out of oil ( the fertilizer and pesticide both being made out of oil , you are literally eating oil when you eat these plants ) to the buildings made out of oil ( vinyl and polyester carpet floors , plastic counter tops , vinyl chair seats , mattresses stuffed with polyfill and saturated in fire retardants ) cars made out of oil ( the dash , seats , etc all made from oil ) and running on oil , the same at school and home , and eating out of plastic and cans that have xenoestrogenic effects on the health. oil is not good for us and every oil-based product has a xenoestrogenic response in the body and unfortunately our entire lifestyles are saturated with petroleum now , from our food to our environments , the clothes on our back , the soap , food containers , building materials , etc its all oil based unless you make a concerted effort to avoid itwouldn ’ t all the hormones they feed cows have something to do with it ? if you are consuming dairy products that have had added female and male hormones that would be a contributing factor . however , most of the female hormones in milk are there naturally due to the pregnancy . most of today ’ s “ improved ” dairy cows are kept pregnant over 300 days of the year . so they are usually milked while pregnant . pregnancy is a very high estrogenic state . dr. garvey would be more qualified as a gynecologist to comment further . being nursed and pregnant at the same time is not a prescription for long and productive life . most dairy cows are sent off to slaughter after only about 4 years . of course they live longer then the male dairy cows who are diverted to veal production and live for about 6 months before slaughter.not all cows receive rbgh , remember , recombinant bovine growth hormone which was injecting into cows to force them to give more milk . this was implicated early on during the 1990 ’ s . and came onto the market with michael taylor , now food czar for the u.s. fda , but in the 1980 ’ s , a lobbyist with monsanto worked to get it widespread into dairy.this was the reason i began buying certified organic organic valley and stonybrook farms dairy milks and yogurt , and i was not alone.however , now with an injured spine , my calcium comes from beans , certain fruits , and mostly dark leafy greens . they don ’ t make my body hurt the way dairy did.the average menarche of the maasai is almost 14 years. considering their diets are almost entirely animal foods [ high protein and high saturated fat ] shouldnt their menache be somewhere around age … 4 ? i couldn ’ t find any references on age of menarche for the maasai but assuming 14 is accurate there are many reasons why it should be higher then folks on the standard american diet but not as high as those on a wfpd . the two that come to my mind are activity and calorie intake based on food availability . photo ’ s of the maasai show them to be very lean . since fat cells produce estrogen women who have higher per cent of body fat will have higher estrogen levels . as jeff novick points out so well in his calorie density dvd you can eat higher calorie dense foods if your physical activity level is high enough . like any complex system there are many factors contributing to the outcome.the massai consume about 3500 calories per day and though “ active ” in the sense that they walk a lot , they aren ’ t as active as american athletes . the massai are lean while eating crazy levels of saturated fat.this article sadly conflates modern , industrially produced , hormone-laden animal foods with all animal foods . it ’ s not like humans haven ’ t been eating meat , dairy , fish and eggs for , oh , thousands and thousands of years now . mongolians , maasai , and other heavy meat eaters don ’ t have early puberty , so this theory , without qualification , is bunk.and the author hasn ’ t even factored in the fact that almost everything processed contains some form of soy now – a known source of phytoestrogens . nor considered all the industrial chemicals used in the u.s. in everything from furniture to clothing that are known xenoestrogens ! we can ’ t just lay it all on animal protein , it doesn ’ t make good sense or science.it is totally possible to get wholesome meat , dairy , fish and eggs that haven ’ t been tainted by industrial chemicals , hormones and soy additives . just ask your local family farmer.ignoring the fact that you did not cite any evidence for your claims , the issues primarily discussed here do not have too much to do with contamination . the most convincing evidence to cut out animal products is ubiquitous among factory farmed meats and organic grass fed meats . that issue being endotoxemia and elevated igf-1. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / endotoxemia / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / igf-1 / in addition , human evidence shows that soy phytoestregons do not function like xenoestrogens and are beneficial to ones health and negligible in terms of negatively effecting hormonal balances . this remains true as long as one is below the 3-5 serving per day mark . after this point , one can expect raised igf-1 levels which in turn may affect early onset of puberty in children and promote tumor growth . this is true due to its protein quality , not necessarily the phytoestrogens. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dairy-sexual-precocity / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / breast-cancer-survival-and-soy / in addition , poultry is a highly concentrated source of arachidonic acid which is highly inflammatory. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid / meat eating is only in recent human history , there are only scant findings before a few hundred years ago . not too many humans can run down a deer or even a rabbit , the muscles in our legs are not designed to do such a thing , but our hands are perfectly designed to grab those apples off a tree , or our teeth to chew on a handful of grass seeds . our intestines , gastric juices , pancreatic enzymes , and bacterial flora are perfect to digest fiber in plants and fruits , not decayed meat . only a carnivore can eat an animal carcass that has sat in the sun for a week , guess what would happen to you ! another possibility is that the europeans are getting a smaller dose of the super-estrogen steroid bisphenol a ( bpa ) .it certainly could be a contributory factor along with many others . since it has been introduced into the food chain relatively recently compared to the declining rates of puberty it most likely isn ’ t a major one . that said i advise patients to avoid it applying the precautionary principle.i don ’ t know how widespread but bpa has been in use since the 1950s http : / / www.enhs.umn.edu / current / 2008studentwebsites / pubh6101 / bpa / history.htmli did not see this early puberty in vegan children , mostly overweight flesheating children . everyone was exposed to bpa without realizing it back then , even the veggie kids . 30 yrs ago when i worked at a city hospital we were helping pregnant 12-13 yr olds deliver babies . in mho , believing meat is ok to feed young girls is living in a fool ’ s paradise . recently , i saw a little girl that was months from puberty at 8 years old , we see that more and more at 9 and up , but 8 really throws you . i hate to say this , but this information has been out for decades , meat eaters are foolsi would add those who eat dairy and eggs to your list as well . i think they are only fools once they learn about the dangers and continue to consume them . unfortunately many health care professionals are missing the opportunity to point out the way to eat as well as its importance.dr.s suspected my 12yr old of having underlying chronic illness because she had not yet reached menarche . 13 1 / 2 now and signs are there but she is hoping not to deal with it til after 14 like her mother and grandmother . both her and i are vegan , grandmother not but in postwar germany everyone virtually so.i don ’ t think it is milk and meat in general that are causing early puberty. there are societies that consume almost nothing but milk and meat ( mongolian , african herders , native americans who ate so little starch that today they are high risk for diabetes , and inuit almost purely meat and fish ) and i don ’ t think these traditional societies ever had a problem with menstruating 9 year olds . the reason we are seeing precocious puberty is due to modern pollutants that mess with the endocrine system . petrochemicals mimic estrogens , are xenoestrogens . also we feed kids foods that make them obese and body fat actually makes some of its own estrogen . kids don ’ t walk to school or play outside like they used to because of fear of molestors and parents getting charged with neglect and their kids being put in cps if they walk or play by themselves in their neighborhoods . so , we are making kids fat and putting them into early puberty by our lifestyles and dependence on petroleum products in our entire lifestyle , most parents don ’ t even understand what xenoestrogens they are exposing their kids to with a plastic baby bottle filled with warm formula made from a factory farmed cow or soy. the moms rub petroleum based lotion on their bellies when pregnant and use chemical air fresheners in the house. these are all xenoestrogenic. we cant go raising humans in a soup of xenoestrogens and also make them obese through too much sugar and not enough activity ( and not enough vitamin d due to being inside all day ) and not expect bad results , in this case , a drastically lowered age of puberty has proven to be the result. animal protein , beef , cancer , cheese , chicken

PLAIN-206	foods that may block cancer formation more than 85 % of breast cancers are sporadic and attributable to long-term exposure to environmental carcinogens , such as those in the diet , through a multistep disease process progressing from non-cancerous to pre-cancerous to malignant stages . how can we interrupt this process ? the chemical carcinogens formed in chicken , fish and other meats during cooking that i profiled in my last two posts estrogens in cooked meat and avoiding cooked meat carcinogens are so effective at transforming normal human breast cells into breast cancer cells that researchers have used it as a model of cancer formation to test out various plant-based interventions . visualize the jekyll to hyde breast cancer transformation here . for example , three recent meta-analyses ( compilations of individual studies ) reviewing all the epidemiological ( population-based ) evidence concerning green tea consumption and breast cancer risk concluded that green tea consumption may be protective . well , now researchers can put it to the test . see my 3-min. video cancer , interrupted : green tea to see what green tea can do to block the transition towards breast cancer caused by the cooked meat carcinogens . more on the chemicals formed by exposing mammal / fish / bird muscles to high temperatures : any other feats green tea can pull off ? see treating genital warts with green tea and treating gorlin syndrome with green tea . might white tea work even better ? see antimutagenic activity of green versus white tea . any other plants that might be able to smack on the cancer kibosh ( besides broccoli of course : dna protection from broccoli and broccoli versus breast cancer stem cells ) ? what about garlic ? watch my 4-min video cancer , interrupted : garlic & flavonoids to find out . should garlic be raw or cooked ? see how can i preserve the anti-cancer effects of cooked garlic ? i ’ ve previously profiled garlic in # 1 anticancer vegetable ( make sure to also watch its “ prequel ” veggies vs. cancer ) . other foods that may protect dna include kiwifruit ( kiwifruit and dna repair ) , cruciferous vegetables ( dna protection from broccoli ) , leafy vegetables ( eating green to prevent cancer ) , and plants in general ( repairing dna damage ) . what other dietary changes should we consider after a cancer diagnosis ? see : dr. gerger ’ s posts on the adverse health effects of cooking meat seem to focus on cooking “ muscles , ” but i wonder if the same problems arise cooking other animal parts , i.e. , liver , organs , etc . might there be something different about cooking muscle tissue that other organ meats do / do not have ? could low heat cooking of a 100 % grass fed , no hormone cow ’ s liver , say , be ok ? or say boiling bones from a similarly well-raised animal to make a stock ? we do so pray that he is wrong about our favorite foods , do we not ? got that right , patricia.not really . i don ’ t enjoy meat and have no taste for liver , trust me on that ; i ’ m just curious what the science would say since the term “ muscles ” was all that was specifically mentioned in dr. gerger ’ s videos summarizing the several research papers.yep , another “ inconvenient truth ” .liver for example , is the store house for toxic metals in the body . i learned this when i gave my first german shorthair pointer liver because it made her coat glow , her hair was soft and silky . soft and silky fur is not something that german shorthair pointers are know for , but i attributed it to her diet . however , the downside of that liver , was she died of a cancer of the cells that line the blood vessels .. whatever it was called . this was the first and last time i had ever fed liver to my pets . and , to think , my mother forced my brother and i to eat liver as children.oh but the magic of “ grassfed ” turns everything unhealthy into a health food ! it ’ s magical ! umm … sorry to have to mention this , but have you looked ^ up ^ recently ? even grass is being polluted by aluminum , barium , etc from chemtrails . see “ what in the world are they spraying ? ” on youtube . i still would eat low on the food chain , rather than eat animal organs that filter toxins . this poor planet.in the book , ” the china study ” by t. colin campbell , phd and thomas m. campbell ii , md , their research found that if a person eats 4 oz. of animal proteins , cancer will grow at a slower rate than if someone at 8 oz. of animal proteins . another study was done with 2 oz .. of animal proteins and the cancer slowly disappeared . one more was done on an all plant based proteins and the cancer disappeared at a much faster rate . it ’ s important to detox , then you have to go to a 100 % holistic / alkaline diet . no sugar . sugar feeds infections and feeds cancer.i ’ m always annoyed when i read a headline that says “ this ( insert favorite food name here ) may prevent ( insert favorite disease here ) ” or “ eating so & so may cure cancer ” , etc. beef , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , broccoli , cancer , chemical carcinogens , chicken , cooked meat , cruciferous vegetables , environmental carcinogens , estrogen , fish , flavonoids , garlic , green tea , kiwifruit , leafy vegetables , meat , plant-based diet , soy , tea , vegan , vegetarian , white tea - -

PLAIN-216	plant-based diets for metabolic syndrome metabolic syndrome , also known as syndrome x , is a medical disorder characterized by the so-called “ deadly quartet ” : abdominal obesity , high fasting blood sugars , high triglycerides , and high blood pressure . metabolic syndrome can set people up for liver disease , stroke , diabetes , cancer , and heart disease . it ’ s been estimated to afflict about a quarter of the american population . how do we stop it and how can we prevent it ? well , if it has to do with obesity , the level of fat in the blood , and high blood pressure then that would seem like a job for plant-based nutrition . in my 2012-2013 year-in-review presentation uprooting the leading causes of death i address the role diet may play in preventing , arresting , and reversing our top 15 killers , including many related conditions . we didn ’ t have data on metabolic syndrome specifically , though , until now . the results can be seen in my 2-min. video metabolic syndrome and plant-based diets . even after controlling for lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise , risk was highest in those eating non-vegetarian , intermediate for those eating semi-vegetarian , and lowest in those eating vegetarian , cutting the odds of having metabolic syndrome by more than half . we see that same step-wise progression towards lower disease risk the more plant-based one ’ s diet gets with high blood pressure , cataracts , diabetes , and obesity . to maximize benefits it appears we have to move towards maximizing the proportion of plants in our diet , but it ’ s not all or nothing . just adding more healthy plant foods to crowd out some of the animal and junk foods in the diet may offer significant protection . for example , consumption of three portions of whole grains a day appears as powerful as high blood pressure medications in alleviating hypertension . an analysis of a bunch of randomized drug trials suggests that taking blood pressure lowering drugs may reduce the risk of getting a heart attack by 15 % and the risk of getting a stroke by about 25 % , the same benefits attributed to three daily servings of whole grains . some grains appear to be more protective than others , though . watch my 2-min. video whole grains may work as well as drugs to find out which may work better . more on refined versus whole grains can be found in great grain robbery and is white bread good for you ? whole grains may in fact extend our lifespan ( what women should eat to live longer ) , but what about the phytates in whole grains ? see new mineral absorption enhancers found . and see antioxidants in a pinch for how to make your morning oatmeal even healthier . plant-based diets provide an excellent defense against the diseases triggered by metabolic syndrome primarily since these healthy diets provide the essential antioxidants lacking in a typical western diet . the healthiest plant-based diets contain little or no meat . and when such diets contain limited meat ( particularly red or processed meat ) , less potentially harmful heme iron is absorbed . when too much iron builds up in anyone having impaired antioxidant defenses ( i.e. , in those not eating enough plant-based foods ) , excessive oxidative stress will occur which can accelerate cell , tissue and dna damage . excessive oxidative stress can initiate the development of the disease associated with metabolic syndrome . most affected individuals harbor significant central obesity , which provides abundant lipids for harmful lipid peroxidation and more severe adverse consequences . those who already have two or more risk factors for metabolic syndrome will generally reduce their risk by increasing their intake of nutrient-dense , plant-based foods , and if their iron stores are elevated , reducing their intake of meat and / or by donating blood.since red meat is not good and fish is toxic and chicken has bacteria , is it okay to eat canned chicken ? donna , all meat naturally contains chemicals that damage the arterial endothelial cells , resulting in coronary disease . i wish it were otherwise , as the smell of broiling meat still makes me salivate , but unfortunately there ’ s no eating meat of any kind if you want to protect your heart . the issues about fish toxins and chicken bacteria are secondary . chicken and fish contribute equally with red meat to coronary disease because they are meat , not because of the secondary problems with them.is canned chicken safe to eat ? abdominal obesity , antioxidants , cancer , cataracts , diabetes , heart disease , high blood pressure , high blood sugar , high triglycerides , hypertension , liver disease , metabolic syndrome , obesity , phytates , plant-based diet , refined grain , stroke , syndrome x , vegan , vegetarian , white bread , whole grain , whole grains - -

PLAIN-2186	supplements contrary to the claims of many sellers of supplements ( including bad advice from health food stores ) , we should strive to get most of our nutrients from produce not pills , though there are rare diseases that require supplementation.there are tens of thousands of phytonutrients in plants that can display synergistic effects and have not been successfully isolated efficaciously in supplement form . for example iron , which is important during pregnancy , may be harmful in pill form . similarly , folate in beans and greens is preferable to folic acid in pills . flax seed , but not flax seed oil , lowers cholesterol . citrulline supplements may aid erectile dysfunction , but a better source is watermelon . similarly , eating soy foods , rather than taking soy supplements , may reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence . and it is whole produce , not pills , which has been shown to increase physical attractiveness.however , for those on plant-based diets , there are two vitamins not produced by plants that may require supplementation . they are vitamin d from sun but not from tanning beds ( see also here , here , here , here , here , here , here ) and vitamin b12 ( see also here , here , here , here , here ) . among vegans , b12 deficiency is an epidemic if no supplements are used , which can have devastating consequences for their infants ( see also here ) . vegetarian ’ s myelopathy is a syndrome coined to describe vitamin b12 decficiency , which can result in paralysis . another nutrient vegans should keep an eye on is iodine , which is especially important during pregnancy ( though harmful in too too great quantities ) .one of the most commonly used supplements is fish oil . it has been found to contain ddt as well as other industrial pollutants , including high levels of dioxin , pcbs and mercury ( which are neural and cardiac toxins ) . this includes distilled fish oil , cod liver oil and those labeled ‘ toxin-free ’ . instead , there are safe plant sources of omega-3 ; alternatives include algae and yeast derived epa and dha , which also lower inflammation.while there are some harmless vitamin supplements such as vitamin c and airborne supplements , others may do more harm than good , such as multivitamins , which may actually increase breast and prostate cancer risk , and antioxidant vitamin supplements such as vitamin e that may shorten one ’ s lifespan.a variety of other potentially harmful supplements exist including : herbalife ( for its liver toxicity , possibly due to vitamin a ) , juice plus + ( which is really just another vitamin supplement ) , glyconutrient supplements , lutein pills , creatine , copper supplements ( which may contribute to alzheimer ’ s ) , zinc gel , kombucha tea , noni juice , and rice bran . ayurvedic medicine ( see also here ) has been found to contain lead . spirulina and blue-green algae supplements may contain neurotoxins and / or liver toxins ( a safer alternative is chlorella ) .see also the related blog posts : vitamin d : shedding some light on the new recommendations , vegan b12 deficiency : putting it into perspective - antioxidants , oxidative stress , vegetables , fruit , vitamin c , phytonutrients , cancer , nuts , beans , men 's health , alternative medicine , broccoli , vitamin e , mental health , mortality - -

PLAIN-22	why are cancer rates so low in india ? it is estimated that many tumors start around the age of 20 . however , detection of cancer is normally around the age of 50 or later . thus , it takes cancer decades to incubate . why does it take so long ? recent studies indicate that in any given type of cancer , hundreds of different genes must be modified to change a normal cell into a cancer cell . although cancers are characterized by the dysregulation of cell signaling pathways at multiple steps , most current anticancer therapies involve the modulation of a single target . chemotherapy has gotten incredibly specific , but the ineffectiveness , lack of safety , and high cost of these monotargeted therapies has led to real disappointment , and drug companies are now trying to develop chemo drugs that take a multitargeted approach . many plant-based products , however , accomplish multitargeting naturally and are inexpensive and safe compared to drugs . however , because drug companies are not usually able to secure intellectual property rights to plants , the development of plant-based anticancer therapies has not been prioritized . they may work ( and work better for all we know ) , and they may be safer , or even fully risk free . if we were going to choose one plant-based product to start testing , we might choose curcumin , the pigment in the spice turmeric ( the reason curry powder looks yellow ) . before we start throwing money at research , we might want to ask some basic questions , like “ do populations that eat a lot of turmeric have lower cancer rates ? ” the incidence of cancer does appear to be significantly lower in regions where turmeric is heavily consumed . population-based data indicate that some extremely common cancers in the western world are much less prevalent in regions where turmeric is widely consumed in the diet . for example , “ overall cancer rates are much lower in india than in western countries . ” u.s. men get 23 times more prostate cancer than men in india . americans get between 8 and 14 times the rate of melanoma , 10 to 11 times more colorectal cancer , 9 times more endometrial cancer , 7 to 17 times more lung cancer , 7 to 8 times more bladder cancer , 5 times more breast cancer , and 9 to 12 times more kidney cancer . this is not mere 5 , 10 , or 20 percent more , but 5 , 10 , or 20 times more . hundreds of percent more breast cancer , thousands of percent more prostate cancer — differences even greater than some of those found in the china study . the researchers in this study , highlighted in my video back to our roots : curry and cancer , conclude : “ because indians account for one-sixth of the world ’ s population , and have some of the highest spice consumption in the world , epidemiological studies in this country have great potential for improving our understanding of the relationship between diet and cancer . the lower rates of cancer may , of course , not be due to higher spice intake . several dietary factors may contribute to the low overall rate of cancer in india . among them are a “ relatively low intake of meat and a mostly plant-based diet , in addition to the high intake of spices . ” forty percent of indians are vegetarians , and even the ones that do eat meat don ’ t eat a lot . and it ’ s not only what they don ’ t eat , but what they do . india is one of the largest producers and consumers of fresh fruits and vegetables , and indians eat a lot of pulses ( legumes ) , such as beans , chickpeas , and lentils . they also eat a wide variety of spices in addition to turmeric that constitute , by weight , the most antioxidant-packed class of foods in the world . population studies can ’ t prove a correlation between dietary turmeric and decreased cancer risk , but they can certainly inspire a bunch of research . so far , curcumin has been tested against a variety of human cancers , including colorectal cancer , pancreatic cancer , breast , prostate , multiple myeloma , lung cancer , and head and neck cancer , for both prevention and treatment . for more information on turmeric and curcumin , check out carcinogen blocking effects of turmeric curcumin and turmeric curcumin reprogramming cancer cell death . i ’ m working on another dozen or so videos on this amazing spice . this is what i have so far : amla , dried indian gooseberry powder , is another promising dietary addition : i add amla to my pink juice with green foam recipe . not all natural products from india are safe , though . see , for example , my video some ayurvedic medicine worse than lead paint exposure . more on the antioxidant concentration in spices in general in antioxidants in a pinch . why do antioxidants matter ? see food antioxidants and cancer and food antioxidants , stroke , and heart disease . which fruits and vegetables might be best ? see # 1 anticancer vegetable and best fruits for cancer prevention . i need to start cooking more indian food . it ’ s a good thing it ’ s so tasty . just remember guys , most indian restaurant food is loaded with butter and cream.very true . do you know if that is also the case in india ? i hear they eat alot of clarified butter . ( ghee ) ghee is definitely the preferred frying medium , but the day to day food is basically a simple dal , vegetable dish , and rice . the rich and creamy dishes are reserved for special occasions.you can make many indian dishes without … they may not be precise , but they are close and very good … this is true . i make both northern and southern dishes by roasting my spices in a dry pan instead of in oil . it all tastes delicious.this indian chef shows how oil free spice roasting is done. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = xp8g4n5k3iqjustme : fun video ! thanks for the link.veganrunner : sounds like you got some knowledgeable answers to your actual question . i just wanted to share that pcrm ’ s 21 day kickstart program has an indian version , which is still in english , but all the recipes are indian ones . it is my understanding that those recipes were developed by natives . so , those recipes should be a way to make some reasonably authentic tasting indian food without the animal products . ( the 21 day kickstart program is free , though requires registration . ) just sharing in case you would be interested.thanks thea . the reason i was asking is because i have a patient who refuses to give ghee up . he is under the impression it is a health food . one of his indian friends told him so and he is sticking to it ! she also said to eat walnuts so it isn ’ t all bad advice . i was wondering if anyone knew of this tradition / belief . but i think brydon gave a good answer – “ used for special occasions . ” veganrunner : very interesting . this is the second time in a relatively short time where i have heard of someone who has seriously taken health advice from someone who isn ’ t qualified . the other person was swearing by what her masseuse told her . : -oas you say , you already have an answer . but i was wondering if maybe the following would also help ? this short jeff novick video doesn ’ t mention ghee , but the same principle would apply . of course , your patient may not be able to make the connection … https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = lbalgjmzuek & feature = fvwrelgood luck with your patient.i am indian pharmacologist and try answering some questions . yes indians use lot of spice in food . turmeric is traditional and compulsion in many foods . turmeric is an hall mark to be used in all sacred occasions . in marriage it is used on bride / groom face . many events of day involves turmeric.coming to ghee . yes consumption of ghee is extremely good for health . but the ghee what we are suppose to use is clarified butter extracted from butter milk and not from the milk solids . now by research it is known that butter can slim you down and we believe ghee also should.if any recipe is required please do ask ramesh000 @ yahoo.com @ veganrunner : disqusyou can replace ghee in most indian dishes with coconut milk or coconut oil . i know , coconut oil and milk are bad too but probably not as bad as ghee , which is even worse than butter.milk is very bad i agree , but coconut oil is extremely good for brain and antimicrobial . it keeps you slim . try putting on wt by using oil . you fail totally and become slim.brydon10 : here ’ s a recipe for you to get started : tofu paneer bhurji . the recipe was recently featured in pcrm ’ s recipe of the week . i haven ’ t made it yet myself , but it looks really , really good and i have vowed to give it a try . if you try it first , let us know what you think. http : / / support.pcrm.org / site / messageviewer ?

) . anything to emphasize your comments are far from a typical blog entry.i think it would be hard to number references because he links to other videos , which of course have ample citations . we can still click the hyperlinks and see the individual references : - ) thanks for your kind words ! i agree , “ anything to emphasize your comments are far from a typical blog entry . ” excellent post ! i ’ m moving in with an indian family in a few months and will have to learn to love spicy food . ( leaving out the ghee , of course ! ) very helpful information about curcumin . what is the best and reliable place to buy curcumin ? i would suggest the turmeric spice , either fresh root or powder , rather than curcumin capsules . i ’ m not sure a reliable curcumin supplement , but perhaps others have more experience and can weigh-in ? joseph , do you know anything of liquid turmeric ? it is sold here in australia in health food shops.i don ’ t , sorry . i go for the powder and sometimes the root . one time i juiced the root and my juicer turned yellow . true ( uneventful ) story . good luck ! thank you joseph i will try the fresh root of turmeric spice . if you have any reliable place to buy , please let me know : ) any grocery store should do : - ) thank you joseph : ) it is just difficult to trust in any source of real ingredients ! but i will still keep checking at mountain rose herbs ’ web sitea good place to buy bulk herbs and spices , etc online is mountain rose herbs . they actively work to protect and preserve the earth . they are dedicated to sustainable business practices and support small organic farms around the world , as well as efforts to protect our wild lands.i just checked the web site but they are out of stock of turmeric root . if you have any other suggestion please let me know.i don ’ t know where you are based , but i find fresh turmeric root in both chinese , indian and asian food stores.just this morning i saw fresh turmeric root at sprouts market but it was expensive . the turmeric powder i use these days is from a company called terrasoul . it ’ s organic and i ’ m very happy with the product . i bought it online directly from the company but it ’ s available at amazon , too . i ’ ve used other organic turmeric brands from amazon and they ’ re all pretty good , too . one has to be careful buying turmeric , or any other spice , from indian stores because 1 ) the spices are not organic 2 ) the turnover is low , which affects the freshness . good turmeric powder has a bright color between orange and yellow ( saffron , amber ? ) . if it ’ s pale yellow , it ’ s best days are behind it . ( i ’ m from that part of the world and have been eating turmeric all my life , so i ’ m pretty familiar with it . ) sorry , are we talking about the same country ? .. https : / / nitawriter.wordpress.com / 2007 / 04 / 26 / india-has-one-of-the-highest-cancer-rates-in-the-world / according to the stats in that , india has , overall , one of the highest rates of cancer in the world . i seriously don ’ t know if i can trust this website for unbiased information . it seems as though whenever a new video comes out and you double check the facts , it becomes evident that what we are actually dealing with is a thinly disguised springboard for either preaching veganism or having a bash at ‘ animal products ’ . i can ’ t think of much in india that we can be proud of in terms of nutrition.and how ironic that india , of all countries in the world , should be looked at through vegan tinted specs , in order to say something positive about either vegetarianism or veganism.there are nationwide deficiencies of iron http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25614831 , b12 , choline and even d3 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25883424.none of this would be so if they had regular access to clean animal foods http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 24866058 that supply these nutrients . and please remember that ghandi himself tried to live off a vegan diet with his followers , but later concluded that it was detrimental to their health ( which of course it is . they drank some milk to correct , at least partially , the imbalance ) we should , with heads hung low in shame , remember that in india there is an epidemic of b12 deficiency that has crippled the nations health . millions of children are born with massively impaired cognitive function , often because of the parents stubborn refusal to eat foods of ‘ animal ’ origin . are we contributing to this gross misinformation ? this website claims to be impartial and yet will not address such real burning issues amonst this poor population of people ; and that , just for the sake of upholding a religious ideology ( i.e ‘ veganism ’ ) .come on folks , this is peoples lives we are dealing with here . remember that the possibility that “ a large percentage may have a subclinical vitamin deficiency are not simply theoretical within populations in india ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 74 / 2 / 157.full and , ” it has been known for > 3 decades that vegetarians in india have lower serum cobalamin concentrations than do nonvegetarians , with the lowest concentrations being in vegans ” this is not some wacky study looking at correlation .. we are talking about the hard science of nutrition , which does not respect our ideologies . so how does the b12 factor influence cancer ? in numerous ways : if indian women could only get their b12 levels up ( even if it were just from a few glasses of clean , raw milk if they had issues with ‘ meat ’ ) they would massively reduce their risk of cervical cancer http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2971743 / .that is just one example.but remember that cancer aside briefly , 60 % of indian women are aenimic .. pray , what is that to be proud of ? will curcumin sort that out ? and more importantly , how would vegetarian foods help these poor women ? a half of all kids under the age of 4 are malnourished … .plant foods to the rescue ? get real people.no plant foods are going to supply the b12 , d3 , retinol or omega 3 etc that are among the most common nutritional deficiancies found with the indian populations http : / / www.thehealthsite.com / news / national-nutrition-week-2014-top-nutritional-deficiencies-in-india / . we just need honest people to acknowledge this.gunter73 the reference you site reports 7 lakhs indians will be diagnosed with cancer in 2015 . 7 lakhs in case you do not know is 700,000. that is out of population of 1,200,000,000.in us according to 2012 report 13 million people were living with cancer . 13 million is 130 lakhs out of population which is 1 / 6th of indian population.hi g-man , be that as it may , i still don ’ t think we have a lot to celebrate about the health of the indian nation ; that is why i broght up the issue of malnourishment .. it is an absolute epidemic , and one which saddens us . we desparately need practical solutions to this problem.did you read the articles that you referenced ? it talked about the difference between traditional india and now . traditionally , india had very low rates of cancer , but with all their gmo and pesticide laden farms now , things seem to be changing . it does not seem that you are interested in finding out about what could make sense here , but rather , trying to create conflict with dr. greger . i don ’ t find your post informative or interesting , just creating conflict for its own sake . do you really think that india isn ’ t the land of most sophisticated and greatest use of spices for health ? then who is ? john s pdx orhi john , i personally love indian cuisine more than any other in the world ( ! ) .. not only that but years of personal involvement with indians has given me a great soft spot for them .. that was the reason for my post . when we have all ‘ said our bit ’ those issues i raised are still there .. and they make me sad . and no doubt they do with you as well . india has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world . not , i believe , primarily because of diet . but certainly diet has played a role . john , i love all those spices and am fully aware of their healing power .. but my point is that they wont address the harcore nutritional deficiency problems that the indain people suffer , simply because the spices wont supply the body with those nutrients.india is one of the few countries in the world where compassion and mercy for animals is actually part of the mainstream culture , i can ’ t see why anyone would want to reverse this and contribute to the horrible stain on humanity that is industrial animal agriculture . if there is a nationwide b12 deficiency as you say , the obvious solution would be to have the government mandate fortification of common foods with b12 rather than convince poor people to go against their religious / ethical beliefs and buy food that they likely can ’ t afford anyway . as for iron , there are plenty of plant sources of iron , it ’ s a matter of educating people on how to obtain enough . remember that anemia is common among women even in western countries where they are eating loads of meat . d3 can be obtained from sunlight , my guess is that more people are doing office jobs now so don ’ t go out enough during the day so this is also a matter of education.you said “ india is one of the few countries in the world where compassion and mercy for animals is actually part of the mainstream culture ” well perhaps keeps in the culture , but things are pretty ugly now : “ india has been the largest exporter of beef in the world since last year , and has further widened its lead over second-ranked brazil with a projected total of 2.4 million tons exported in 2015 against brazil ’ s 2 million.the usda report , released earlier this month , predicts that global beef exports overall will rise to a record 10.2 million tons , 3 % higher than the october 2014 forecast.beef has also overtaken basmati rice as india ’ s largest agricultural food export in terms of value , according to data from the country ’ s agricultural and processed food products ’ export development authority , cited by the economic times newspaper.although the slaughter of cows , sacred for the hindus that make up india ’ s majority population , has long been banned in several parts of the country , states like maharashtra — one of its largest — recently expanded the ban to include bulls and bullocks as well . however , since india ’ s exports are composed entirely of water-buffalo meat or carabeef , the bans will not affect the figures cited in the report . ” http : / / time.com / 3833931 / india-beef-exports-rise-ban-buffalo-meat / hi doug , i take your point about the fortification and thanks for attempting to address the issue with a cool head ( ! ) i think the people of india , just as anywhere else , have the right to choose for themselves . some of them refuse to eat any animal products and for them the fortification idea is certainly a solution . for the vegetarians who drink milk for a food source of b12 , that milk shoul be made available and should be clean ( an aside , i dont personally drink milk ) . i would never suggest that they should eat anything against their conscience , but that would also include a purely plant-based diet.you must get a good workout jumping to conclusions , huh ? nutrition facts , not vegan facts … get it ? veganism is some arbitrary cult that abducted you against your will to elucidate us poor malnourished souls ? so you ’ re here to inform us that eating a plant based diet is somehow deficient ? did you even read the articles you so magnanimously provided because you missed some critical info … as others already stated . what is your agenda ? try another website , this one is based on science , not your personal belief that killing animals is a need to feed you ! what do you think the animals you favor for your dinner eat , to grow up to be on your precious plate ? plants … oh how does bessie manage ? ? ? and milk ? spare me ! unless you are a baby cow sir , why would you suck on cow ’ s milk ? human milk is for human babies , and contains the right proportion of nutrients for them . cow ’ s milk exists to make a calf grow into a half ton cow in a year … not a healthy goal for people , not to mention the foreign proteins that confound our biochemistry and cause many health issues . once any animal is weaned , milk is not necessary . just because we can , doesn ’ t mean we should . so i gotta ask , are you an infant or a calf … based on your sarcastic rant it ’ s hard to guess . by the way , b12 is made by soil bacteria , not animals . it would do anyone well to take some supplementation , since we have depleted the soil and have become so anal about a speck of it on our produce anyway , and even cows don ’ t get to graze the earth since they are forced to eat the crap the factory farms feed them . ( as if they don ’ t stand in enough of their own all day ) instead of their natural diet of grass they are forced to ingest cheap chemical laden grains , other dead animals , antibiotics to keep them alive under grotesque conditions , and other unsuitable slop , and their flesh concentrates all the other pollutants you so enjoy . yumm , chow down ! or do you prefer “ free range ” instead ? lol , yeah , that ’ s sustainable , great option . not a possibility when we have more cows than people nor the land to sustain them . or piggies . or chickens . ( and all those lovely by-products ) . when you see one of those animals , do you start salivating , chase after them at high speed , crush their neck in your pointy snout and vicious canines , and rip out their bloody innards with your sharp claws like any other carnivore ? and digest it in your highly acidic stomach and exceptionally short carnivore intestine so it doesn ’ t putrefy like in us biologically herbivorous humans ? or maybe you are merely an omnivore , like a bear , or a racoon , or a skunk . oh wait , they have pointy snouts , sharp teeth and vicious claws too … hmmm . do you have a picture to share ? eating animals is what advanced our brain growth and allowed us to evolve from apes into smart folks like you , right ? yep , just like all those other omnivores and carnivores … gee , what hampered their brains , eating all that meat ? maybe they never learned to harness fire and cook so they could get more nutrients for brain growth ? so ‘ prey ’ , what is your “ deficiency ” that you are compelled to spew your “ anemic ” ideology here ? “ honest people ” can deal with the truth without bending reality to suit their personal tastes and preferences . many of us have experienced first hand the healing effects of an appropriate diet in the return of health and shedding of disease , it speaks for itself quite clearly if you aren ’ t into denial . forcing your biased and slanted opinions down the throats of those who know better prompts me to offer you some more real science , outside of this “ preachy ” “ animal product bashing ” one , to sink your frightful canines into … https : / / www.scribd.com / doc / 94656 / the-comparative-anatomy-of-eating http : / / plantpositive.com / http : / / www.pcrm.org / http : / / www.onegreenplanet.org / lifestyle / the-vegan-diet-backed-by-science / http : / / www.nih.gov / researchmatters / june2013 / 06102013vegetarian.htm http : / / www.theatlantic.com / health / archive / 2012 / 01 / the-evidence-for-a-vegan-diet / 251498 / http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / natural.html https : / / www.forksoverknives.com / contributors / rip-esselstyn / https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / http : / / www.dresselstyn.com / site / plant-based-nutrition / http : / / nutritionstudies.org / http : / / doctorklaper.com / http : / / foodrevolution.org / sorry charzie but you ’ re reply is just too overweaning . you have failed to address even one of the issues i raised in what i wrote . they are real issues involving real people that call for real solutions beyond eating a handfull of soil.and seeing as you took it on yourself to remind me that this website is concerned with ‘ science ’ , why did you not reply to my post with cool-headed scientific answers ? as it is you have simply resorted to borderline insult accompanied with a seething rage .. but all that aside there are some things you mentioned that i would like to address .. first up , i did not say that a plant-based diet cannot cure disease : it can . but lacking any clinical experience , you seem to assume that a plant-based diet will cure the spectrum of diseases that are all connected with b12 deficiency . even dr gregor himself will tell you that is simply not true . there is such an epidemic in india . how do you suggest this be dealt with ? the reason i mentioned milk is that many indians who dont eat meat drink milk because it contains a modest amount of vitamin b12 .. if they choose , for whatever reason , not to eat meat or drink milk they run the risk of developing one of the b12 deficiency diseases . i think a five year old can work that out . the basic problem with your approach to health and nutrition is that issues such as ‘ sustainability ’ and ‘ animal welfare ’ and the likes are a separate issue . i dont actually disagree with you on those issues , but they are separate from a discussion of say retinol or d3 or b12 .. the issues i broght up in my post which you failed to address . this ‘ fudging ’ of human health with environmental issues forces people to become dishonest . i guarantee that if you listen to dr essylstyn or dr macdougall or one of the other ‘ plant-based ’ doctors speak for more than an hour , they will all at some point in their talk / lecture bring up environmental issues .. they are two totally different issues.if i was overweening , i was just mirroring your haughty , opinionated , diatribe . you know what they say about opinions … i ’ ve been adding whole frozen amla ( indian gooseberries ) to my breakfast oatmeal , purchased at my local indian grocery . would the frozen fruit possibly be subject to heavy metal contamination ? ? if dr. greger regularly eats powdered amla , can i assume the gooseberry component of triphala , which he warns against , is safe ? dr. greger initially praised triphala due to its impressive antioxidant capacity but later withdrew his recommendation based on the presence of various contaminants in some of the samples tested . banyon botanicals sells all manner of ayurvedic products . i questioned them re : this issue . they responded by reciting the testing and quality control measures that they employ which are documented on their website . i was satisfied with their response and have been purchasing triphala as well as tulsi and hingvastak from them.my bigger question is : can we trust the produce , frozen produce , and dried spices – imported from india – available at most indian groceries ? cathy : the only safest – or least unsafe – way to buy anything grown in india is to buy organic products imported by a reputable us company . if the frozen amla you use is not organic , i think using them is taking a chance . psychmd mentioned banyon botanicals . another good company is organic india . i take triphala tablets made by planetary herbals.listing countires by life expectancy , india ranks # 150 out of # 193 countries , near the bottom of the list ( but they don ’ t get cancer ) . i ’ ve lived in india and the average indian is in very poor health ( but they don ’ t get cancer ) . the grass isn ’ t always greener on the ‘ other side ’ .you must take into account that in a lot of india ( countryside areas ) the living conditions are the ones of a third world country , sanitation is terrible , what would you expect ? i don ’ t think that even the cities there fare much better . similarly , some countries in africa part of the population have healthier diets than in western countries , yet their life expectancy is not surprisingly , what you would expect from third world countries.now india is changing as it follows western diet . all times meat , soft drinks , medicine for small health problem etc.india has become poor country , because politicians are stashing trillions of $ by corruption . when there is lack of justice , poor finance , diet always takes a hit . to use knowledge they need moneyreference : world health organizationhttp : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / list _ of _ countries _ by _ life _ expectancythe life expectancy in india is only 65 . are they just dying of something else before they have a chance to get cancer ? this might make an interesting topic for a future video . curcumin boosts dha in the brain : implications for the prevention of anxiety disorders.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25550171brain : wow , this is great news ! for those who don ’ t eat fish the only way to get dha directly is through algal dha , which is expensive . thanks for posting.turmeric is truly the next wonder drug . does anyone know just how much tumerick you need daily to be effective ? also does taking the tumor it as a capsule work just as well ? we in india seeing cancer rate is steadily increase in the past 5 years … every one is using white polished rice rice … lot of refined oil … meat intake is on rise … . spices which they use are highly adulterated … its all globalization invasion in every country … .. http : / / www.xulonzoe.org health retreat center … however , hepatitis & diabetes are high up there – why ? “ americans get between 8 and 14 times the rate of melanoma ” anybody stop to think whether the dramatically higher levels of melanin in the average indian ’ s skin might have something to do with this ? ? i am truly believe that plan base diet it ’ s best treatment for cancer , i got diagnosed stage 2 b breast cancer in nov . 2013 . i ’ m only 32 at that time , i was scared ， my little girl only 2 month old . i starting to search best treatment for cancer and then i found dr. greger . learned a lot . i rejected chemo and radiation . start to cut meat little by little , around august 2014 , after i finished 3 times surgery , i became a vegan and i feel better and better and better every day . i didn ’ t take any drugs , my treatment just eat healthy and do exercise that ’ s all . my doctors are worried , but all the test results are showing i ’ m fine , i ’ m cancer free . and i feel really good , i don ’ t feel any sickness at all . right now i am back to normal , back to my old job , work full time , with two kids , life is good . i ’ ll keep my healthy lifestyle for my rest of my life , because it works , and i believe i have many many years to come . god bless everyone ! jojo : thanks for sharing your story . i can just imagine how scared you were . congratulations on being cancer free . i hope it continues that way for the rest of your life . and congratulations on eating a healthy diet . that can be a hard change for some people to make , even with a health condition . but you did it . you should be proud.what brand ( s ) of amla do you use in your pink drink so as to avoid contamination with toxic heavy metals ? thanks for the great service you provide , dr. gregeri cannot recommend a specific brand , but perhaps others using it and can give there take ? carl : while i can ’ t make any assertions myself , lots of people swear by the company , mountain rose herbs , as a great source for trust-worthy herbs / powders / teas etc . here are their amla selections. https : / / www.mountainroseherbs.com / search ? page = 1 & q = amla & utf8 = % e2 % 9c % 93 sadly , the powder is currently out of stock . but you could ask them when they will get it in again . ( note : while they are out of the powdered one , they do have the dehydrated version for the same price . depending on how the dehydrated product ends up being , you might be able to just get that and grind it up yourself in a food processor . or maybe enjoy it better in the chunky form ? ? ? just an idea . ) empowering article … thank you … please consider adding “ blogger ” to your “ add this ” buttonin india yogurt and cheese and ghee ( butter ) are eaten regularly all of which dr gregor usually finds cause cancer ? aloha , from memory ( i ’ m in thailand now ) harvard u. wondering why vegetarians have a 70 % less chance of getting cancer decided to look into it : what were vegetarians doing or not doing as the case maybe . harvard researchers found that chlorophyll wraps itself around the mutagen and the cancerous cell was now too large to penetrate a healthy cell . so , your body just eliminates it . tamils are primarily vegetarians so it would be interesting to know if their cancer rates were even lower than non-tamil rates . ( much like the seven day adventists vs other christians . ) another factor with a plant based diet , especially one with a lot of “ leafy green vegetables ” , is the body ’ s ph goes into the alkaline range and this also suppresses cancers , viruses and spoors . ( acidic ph is just the opposite in creating an environment in which these mutagens thrive . ) indians also consume much less food than westerners – it ’ s a poor country . did the studies control for caloric restriction which has for many decades demonstrated similar effects ? “ contaminated vegetarianism ” of asian indian is fallacy . the true indian diet life style should be taken from rural india where stuff like ice cream , saturated fats and fried foods are not seen . it will be interesting study the prevalence of heart diseases in urban vs and rural indian population to reinforce this view . yes , typical indian diet comprises ghee and butter which is proved to be good for health particularly brain . honey , butter and ghee is often prescribed in ayurveda while recent studies have de-linked the saturated fats ( not trans-fats or artificial hydrogenated fats ) with heart diseases but they seem to be pronounced effect when viewed in conjunction with life style . hence a deductive inference about a particular food as bad of good seem to be inconclusive unless a holistic factors are taken for study which is highly unlikely in the present research studies. antioxidants , beans , bladder cancer , bladder health , breast cancer , breast health , cancer , cancer survival , chemotherapy , chickpeas , china study , colon cancer , curcumin , curry powder , endometrial cancer , fruit , india , industry influence , kidney cancer , kidney health , legumes , lentils , lung cancer , lung health , meat , medications , melanoma , men 's health , multiple myeloma , pancreatic cancer , plant-based diets , prostate cancer , prostate health , ranking foods , side effects , skin health , spices , turmeric , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , women 's health - -

PLAIN-226	bugs & drugs in pork : yersinia and ractopamine consumer reports recently released a study in which they analyzed u.s. retail pork and found trace levels of an adrenaline-like drug called ractopamine in about 20 percent of the samples and a foodborne bacteria that sickens nearly 100,000 americans every year called yersina in two-thirds of pork samples . ractopamine safety analysis the national pork producers council tried to address concerns about ractopamine by noting that the levels in meat of this muscle growth promoter , which is fed to pigs in the form of paylean ™ and turkeys in the form of topmax ™ , were below the limit set by the un codex commission last summer . what they didn ’ t mention was that due to outstanding safety concerns , the commission ’ s drug residue limit only passed by a single vote out of 143 ballots cast . the codex commission based this drug residue limit in meat on the only human data available , a study of just six people that wasn ’ t designed to establish safety . at higher doses , the study subjects reported their hearts racing and pounding — so much so that one subject had to be withdrawn from the study . at a lower dose , though , no cardiac changes were noted . so that ’ s the dose the codex commission used to calculate the maximum allowable meat residue and acceptable human daily intake levels . just because a certain dose doesn ’ t cause a problem in six people is no certainty that the dose is safe for everyone . the european food safety authority — europe ’ s equivalent to the u.s. food and drug administration — calculated that a study of six people wouldn ’ t even have the statistical power to pick up a 40 percent change in cardiac output , a key measured endpoint . to detect as statistically significant a clinically relevant change , the study would have required at least 60 people . also , the study only looked at the cardiovascular effects of ractopamine . given its adrenaline-like effects , the drug could also cause metabolic effects in people such as an increase in blood sugar levels or behavioral effects such as restlessness or anxiety . finally , all six study subjects were healthy young men . what about particularly vulnerable populations such as children or people with heart disease ? the european food safety authority panel concluded that the codex limit did not sufficiently take these higher risk populations into account . they concluded that the single small human study “ can not be taken as a basis to derive an acceptable daily intake … and consequently no proposal for maximum [ meat ] residue levels could be made . ” in other words , we simply don ’ t have enough data to determine a safe level of drug exposure from meat . ractopamine – animal health and welfare the council of the european union recently joined china in reaffirming the ban on ractopamine , citing both human health and animal welfare concerns . studies over the last decade have shown that pigs on ractopamine may have chronically elevated heart rates , increased stress reactions , and difficulty walking . in fact the warning label reads : ‘ ‘ caution : pigs fed paylean are at an increased risk for exhibiting the downer pig syndrome , ” a condition in which pigs are too sick , injured , or exhausted to stand and may be dragged to slaughter . the pork industry uses an ironic pretext to defend its use of gestation crates – restrictive cages that virtually immobilize breeding pigs for nearly their entire lives . the industry claims this is to keep them from fighting , but at the same time pork producers feed millions of fattening pigs a drug shown to increases aggressiveness and attacks . given the human and animal welfare concerns , why does the u.s. pork industry continue to feed this drug to their animals every year ? a meta-analysis was recently published in the journal of animal science . based on all the studies done to date , pigs fed ractopamine “ had an overall carcass cutability advantage of 1.01 percentage units when compared to control pigs . ” all this for a 1 percent greater yield . for more on this drug in the meat supply , see my 6-min. video ractopamine in pork . for more on the drug use by the livestock industry see : yersinia – the gift that can keep on giving the discovery of yersinia in pork is no surprise . pigs are considered to be to be the main reservoir for yersinia enterocolitica and pork products the main source of human infection . while most foodborne pathogens come from a variety of sources , 100 percent of the attributable yersinia outbreaks reported in the united states from 1999 through 2008 were caused by pork . what was a surprise is the level of contamination of the u.s. pork supply — 69 percent of samples tested positive — and the level of antibiotic resistance . ninety percent of the yersinia bacteria found contaminating the pork was resistant to one or more antibiotics . in most cases , yersinia food poisoning causes an acute “ stomach flu ” characterized by fever , abdominal pain , and often bloody diarrhea . severe cases are frequently confused with appendicitis , leading to unnecessary emergency surgery . long-term complications of infection include chronic inflammation of the eyes , kidneys , heart , and joints . within a year of a bout of yersinia food poisoning , victims appear to have a 47-fold higher risk of coming down with autoimmune arthritis . the bacteria may also play a role in triggering an autoimmune thyroid condition known as graves ’ disease . yersinia – the role of factory farming the new findings , published in the january 2013 issue of consumer reports , are not surprising given how widespread the infection is in the national herd . the increasing emergence of human infections over the last century has been blamed on the industrialization of the pork industry and higher stocking densities . inside swine confinement buildings , researchers have been able to culture yersinia bacteria right out of the air . the pork industry acknowledges overcrowding pigs is associated with increased health risks , but the trade journal national hog farmer cites research showing that when “ space was dropped to 6 sq. ft . / pig , the building produced 26 % more pounds of pork at the same fixed cost . ” that entails cramming a 200-pound pig in a space equivalent to about 2 feet by 3 feet . sometimes , the article concludes , “ crowding grow-finish pigs a little tighter will make you more money . ” with so many americans falling ill from contaminated pork , why are there no industry-wide yersinia monitoring and control programs in the united states ? perhaps this is because yersinia enterocolitica doesn ’ t cause clinical disease in pigs and therefore doesn ’ t directly affect the industry ’ s bottom-line . the costs of crowded confinement may instead be passed on to the tens of thousands of americans who continue to be sickened every year at an annual estimated cost of a quarter billion dollars . research from europe suggests pigs raised using organic methods – which in europe means more than just what animals are fed – may have 50 times lower odds of harboring yersinia enterocolitica infection compared to pigs raised on conventional factory farms . after studying a variety of factors , the researchers ended up attributing the low rates of yersinia infection on organic farms to lower levels of stress among the animals . if stress is indeed a contributing factor , things may be looking up in europe . on jan . 1 , 2013 gestation crates for pregnant pigs were banned across all 27 nations of the european union . crated sows have been shown to have impaired immunity , thought to be a result of elevated stress hormone levels related to being virtually immobilized for years on end . pregnant sows in the u.s. , where the majority are still crated , have been shown to have among the highest rates of yersinia enterocolitica infection . since infected piglets have been shown to carry the infection through to slaughter , the impact of stress levels on disease resistance of breeding pigs can have human health consequences . thankfully , major u.s. retailers , restaurant chains , and leaders in the pork industry have started phasing out gestation crates , which may end up benefiting both animal welfare and the safety of the meat supply . for more on this pork-borne bacteria check out my 7-min. video yersinia in pork . for more videos on fecal matter contamination of the meat supply , see : the campylobacter in chicken that i end the yersinia video on is the poultry and paralysis bacteria. if you are eating organic and constains statement that no steroids or antibiotics are used can they still contain ractopamine or yersinia ? no ractopamine , but “ when production types and capacities were compared , the prevalence of yersinia pseudotuberculosis was higher in organic production than in conventional production ” laukkanen , riikka , et al . “ transmission of yersinia pseudotuberculosis in the pork production chain from farm to slaughterhouse . ” applied and environmental microbiology 74.17 ( 2008 ) : 5444-5450. http : / / aem.asm.org / content / 74 / 17 / 5444.fullare humans more susceptible to pathogens from pigs than from other animals ( e.g. , cows ) ? i ’ m thinking of how heart valves from pigs are used in humans , so we must be generally more biologically compatible.some actual facts : pigs can get human diseases , and yes , some diseases go the other way . i ’ ve been subscribed to pro-med since about 1999 , and i ’ ve yet to see a report of ‘ yersinia enterocolitis ’ as far as i can recall , much less one associated with pigs.in the consumer reports ‘ study ’ , only 128 samples were taken and evaluated – but they also cite that they took ‘ 148 pork chops and 50 ground pork samples from around the us ’ . discrepancies like that give science a bad name ! a tiny study like that is as silly as the study cited under the ractopamine portion of the article which used only six people ! there is no way that 128 samples is representative of all pork sold in the us , and without links to reputable studies , i can ’ t give that much credence at all.a much better study , of the pigs themselves , is available at http : / / naldc.nal.usda.gov / download / 29507 / pdf and indicated that 3.8 % of 2793 swine carried 106 different isolates of this bacteria which * may * be capable of causing human disease . and , of those , all were susceptible to 13 out of 16 antimicrobial drugs tested – which is pretty typical for any bacteria.again , a relatively small sample , perhaps , in comparison to the millions of pigs sent for slaughter each year in the us , but far better done than the one by consumer reports ! cook your food well , and choose your science with care – you ’ ll do a better job of protecting yourself that way , and be a lot calmer to boot . : ) adrenaline , consumer reports , foodborne bacteria , gestation crates , national pork producers council , pork , ractopamine , yersinia - -

PLAIN-237	pollutants in californian breast tissue americans are walking chemical cocktails according to the latest report from the centers for disease control and prevention . organochlorine pesticides tend to build up in animal fat ( see for example , cannibalistic feed biomagnification , avoiding other banned pesticides , and industrial carcinogens in animal fat ) so we tend to think of meat , eggs , and dairy as being the most heavily contaminated , but there are concerning levels found in some plant foods too . see , for example , my 1-min video pesticides in chinese bamboo shoots . i don ’ t know which is worse , the fact that researchers found nine different pesticide residues in cans of bamboo shoots imported from china , or that they described it as “ only ” nine . nearly all canned foods contain the chemical bpa , which has recently been linked to erectile dysfunction in men . in my 2-min. video bpa plastic and male sexual dysfunction i profile a study that concluded : “ increasing urine bpa level was associated with decreased sexual desire , more difficulty having an erection , lower ejaculation strength , and lower level of overall satisfaction with sex life . ” the only fresh , non-canned food found contaminated with bpa was sliced turkey . i ’ ve previously covered bpa in which plastics are harmful ? , where i detail which “ numbers ” of plastic are probably safest . my other video on plastics chemicals similarly found particularly high levels in poultry . eden foods is one of the few manufacturers that doesn ’ t use bpa . see my blog about their canned beans : do eden beans have too much iodine ? for more on male sexual health see : measuring urine levels of industrial toxins is more useful than measuring food levels , since it indicates how much of the pollutants are actually absorbed into the body . in one sense it tells you what kind of levels are circulating in your body but at the same time it tells you how much your body is able to successfully get rid of . ideally we ’ d like to measure levels in human tissues to see , for example , how much is actually lodged in one ’ s breast tissue . well , people get breast surgery all the time – why not test surgical samples of removed tissue ? women get fibroids removed ; we can test those . we could get data from fresh autopsy samples from accident victims , and hey , what about liposuction ? in my 2-min. video pollutants in californian breast tissue i compare the levels of fire retardant chemicals ( polybromated diphenyl ethers ) in the breast tissue of california women to various tissue samples taken from women in belgium , brazil , the czech republic , france , hong kong , japan , new york city , singapore , and spain . do we wish they could all be california ? no . the breast tissue of california women had nearly 10 times more than women in any other country , and compared to the lowest levels — autopsy samples of japanese women — new yorker liposuction had a hundred times higher levels . sounds like they ’ re eating more than just big apples . other than pet food and fish , which may be most contaminated , where do flame retardant chemicals ( pbde ) and polychlorinated naphthalenes ( pcn ) concentrate in the american food supply ? find out in my 3-min. video food sources of flame retardant chemicals . hello doctor , just concerned now about the effects of bpa free water bottles . is there any current research that indicates whether all bpa free bottles should be avoided ? i have recently purchased a few water bottles for home and work use that i fill up with my own water and drink from each day . wondering whether really , glass bottles would be preferable over any of them. animal fat , bamboo shoots , bpa , canned food , centers for disease control and prevention , china , dairy , eden foods , eggs , erectile dysfunction , industrial toxins , meat , pesticides , poultry - -

PLAIN-2429	diverticulosis : when our most common gut disorder hardly existed diverticula are out-pouchings from our intestine . doctors like using a tire analogy , high pressures within the gut can forced the intestines to balloon out through weak spots in the intestinal wall like an inner tube poking out through a worn tire tread . this is what they actually look like . these pockets can become inflamed and infected , and , to carry the tire analogy further , can blow out , spilling fecal matter into the abdomen or the bladder and lead to death . symptoms can range from no symptoms at all , to a little cramping and bloating , to incapacitating pain that is a medical emergency . nine out of ten people that die from the disease never even knew they had it.but the good news is that there may be a way to prevent the disease . diverticular disease is the most common intestinal disorder , affecting up to 70 % of people by age 60 . if it ’ s that common , though , maybe it ’ s just an inevitable consequence of aging ? no , it ’ s a new disease . in 1907 , 25 cases had been reported in the medical literature . not in 25 % of people but 25 cases period . and they ’ re kind of hard to miss on autopsy . a hundred years ago , in 1916 , it didn ’ t even merit mention in medical and surgical textbooks . the mystery wasn ’ t solved until 1971.how did a disease that was almost unknown become the most common affliction of the colon in the western world within one lifespan ? surgeons painter and burkitt suggested diverticulosis was a deficiency disease , a disease caused by a deficiency of fiber . in the late 1800s roller milling was introduced - further removing fiber from grain , and we started to fill up on fiber deficient foods like meat and sugar . a few decades of this and diverticulosis was rampant.this is what they thought was going on . just as it would be easy to squeeze a lump of butter through a bicycle tube , it ’ s easy to move large soft , moist intestinal contents through the gut . in contrast , try squeezing through a lump of tar . when we eat fiber deficient diets , our feces can be become small and firm , and so our intestines have to really squeeze hard to move them along , and this buildup of pressure may force out those bulges . and eventually , a low-fiber diet can sometimes lead to the colon literally ' rupturing ' itself.if this theory is true , then populations that eat high fiber diets would have low rates of diverticulosis . and that ’ s what ’ s been found . more than 50 % of african americans in their 50 ’ s were found to have diverticulosis , compared to less than 1 % in african africans , eating traditional plant-based diets . and by less than 1 % , we ’ re talking zero out of a series of 2000 autopsies , two out of 4,000 in uganda . that ’ s like a thousand times lower prevalence.what then , about this newer study concluding that a low fiber diet was not associated with diverticulosis . we ’ ll cover that next . i look forward to your coverage of the topic in the follow-up video , as i found the inconsistency in those studies to be confusing . thanks for your work here.i couldn ’ t wait . sorry. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3840096 / are they kidding ? “ we found no difference between the cases and the controls in mean dietary fiber intake ( 14.8 grams versus 15.3 grams per day , p = 0.2 ) and reported supplemental fiber intake ( 5 % versus 5 % , p = 0.7 ) ( table 1 ) . correspondingly , we found no association between dietary fiber intake ( or 0.96 , 95 % ci 0.71 – 1.30 ) and diverticulosis when comparing the highest quartile of fiber intake ( mean 25 grams / day ) to the lowest ( mean 8 grams / day ) ( table 3 ) . we also found no associations between dietary fiber intake by subtype ( beans , grains , fruits and vegetables ) and the presence of diverticulosis ( table 3 ) . ” comparing 15 grams to 25 grams , both values well below the recommended levels ? spoiler alert ! : ) it would have been much too long a weekend to wait . : - ) bahahahahahahahahahaahno one in the study actually had a high fiber diet . it ’ s like comparing a “ low fat ” diet at 30 % fat vs. 50 % fat and saying that heart disease is not correlated to cholesterol or saturated fat intake . i don ’ t especially try to eat fiber , but with whole fruits , brown rice , beans , whole potatoes and greens have 80-90 grams of fiber daily per cronometer.i calculated my fiber since going wfpb and it was ~ 90 . my colon thinks i ’ m the greatest guy now.excellent ! i truly enjoy your videos , finally the truth is being spread . unfortunately a lot of my family in the northeast doesn ’ t believe this . crazy.unfortunately we can ’ t make everyone see.wow ! i , too , am looking forward to the next video . and i can ’ t help but wonder : do current medical students watch these videos ? we hope so ! i know many do , as we always encourage medical students to engage in the website.my question is , can diverticulosis be reversed ? hi eddy . from what we know this canadian brochure is accurate : “ in general , increasing the amount of fibre in the diet is recommended with adequate fluid intake . while this will not cause the diverticula present to become smaller or go away , the high fibre diet may reduce the formation of other diverticula . there is no evidence that avoiding foods such as popcorn or those with small seeds such as strawberries or tomatoes is useful , although this has been recommended in the past . ” from dr. drost and dr. greger : diverticulosis would not be expected to reverse , but may help from getting worse . and a high fiber diet can help bowels keep moving so that current diverticulosis doesn ’ t get infected and become diverticulitis.i also think once presence of diverticula is confirmed , the next best step is to prevent further diverticula and prevent inflammation of the current one , which is through high fiber diet that facilitates bowel movement.what about small unground seeds ( like whole flax seed ) that may be present in a whole-grain bread ? ( i do grind my flax seed to sprinkle on cereals . ) my friend told me that a doctor told him small seeds like that remain lodged in your intestinal tract undigested . any truth in that ? doesn ’ t appear so . it ’ s an old way of thinking ( and rightly so ) that small seeds could get stuck , but there is no data on this theory . if i am mistaken and you find a study let us know ! then we can contact that canadian digestive foundation and see if they might want to update their brochure.why not ? increase fiber and remove the waste that collects in the pouches . the body wants to heal itself and be in a state of homestasis . give it what it needs.maybe we need a few blogs on recognizing bogus studies so we don ’ t get fooled by whoever it is that has an axe to grind- or profit to make.i have divertiulitis and have had to have the right side of my colon removed yet still have diver on my left . i ’ ve been dealing with it for over ten years . i just thought that i would mention that i typically ate a diet rich in fiber for the most part and was mainly vegetarian for about 3 years , years ago . i can say that yes , fiber is important and i know this because green smoothies seem to keep me from having flares . however , i consider hydration , stress management , exercise , and probiotics the real game changer here . i was on flouroquinoline antibiotics several times and i think that they were one of the main causes of the damage to my colon ’ s mucosal lining and the rest of me . but i mention dehydration as it makes a huge difference in how the bowel is able to move things through and stay healthy . and probiotics keep the e-coli at bay . i believe that usually e-coli is the offending culprit to flares ( infection ) and it was the sudden cases of uti ’ s that accompanied my flares that led me down the path of this thinking . also , i personally believe that we do have to be very careful to give our digestive system what it needs and be careful of stress . i ’ ve read that 75 % of our immune system is in our gut . makes sense as stress can cause a flare and we don ’ t feel our emotions in our head ( brain ) but we do feel it in our second brain ( the gut ) . thanks for all you do doc . just thought i ’ d add in my experiences and thoughts with this disease.there ’ s some new hour long lectures ( videos ) on youtube on probiotics that you should watch . not the same old stuff , but brand new medical study stuff that is truly nothing short of amazing . they took obese people and gave them ( injected ) some “ gut bacteria ” from people with fast metabolisms . the obese people became skinny and have stayed skinny for years now , not being able to gain weight if they try , plus other studies . they gave some people who were allergic to nuts some gut bacteria from people who weren ’ t allergic , and the people with the allergies stop being allergic . it ’ s mind blowing . btw , you ’ re also right about stress . stress is a killer and forces weight gain . i ’ m living proof of that . i was completely stressed out in los angeles and a belly to go with it . i said “ screw it ” one day , moved to the bahamas ( now in miami ) , never changed my diet , and have lost 22 pounds , am tan , relaxed , stop having anxiety attacks and have cut my meds in half . in l.a. i would hit the alarm clock and stress would begin , not really noticeable , but even trying to get to work “ on time ” to please some manager is a form of stress . then there ’ s traffic stress , radio talk show getting you upset stress . rent is stressful , car payments are stressful . i said screw it and now have a bike and a studio condo . i love my life ! how bout some links ? i take a probiotic … .http : / / www.swansonvitamins.com / swanson-ultra-soil-based-organisms-90-capsalso give one to my dog … .which probably mixes in real well with what he gets from the bird poop he likes so much . he did get into a bit of trouble when he got into the poop from a couple of turkey vultures when out on a walk . he ’ s an idiot . ; - ) probiotics can be fairly expensive … the above is only $ 3-4 per month . results ? find that it smooths things out … less issues with candida … less issues with minor inflammations … etc . over time they seem to drive out the irritant biotics.also take an oral probiotic … helps with teeth / gum issues.just sent for a book on probiotics … .brain maker : the power of gut microbes to heal and protect your brain  for lifelooking for a poop donor from a skinny person … . ; - ) … or maybe just some references for the biotic strains involved.before you waste your time and your money , try reading “ the problem with david perlmutter , the grain brain doctor ” by alan levinovitzhttp : / / nymag.com / scienceofus / 2015 / 06 / problem-with-the-grain-brain-doctor.htmlbook is on the way … .used … but i paid more than i usually do . i read a lot of stuff … much of which is contradictory to some extent . but just about anything beats the allopathic medicine train … and it is my belief that the best way to stay healthy is to do it yourself . i find that if you pay attention to the results … your best bet is just to try stuff … if it is somewhat reasonable … .and go with what seems to work . i usually try to find some corroboration for ideas and generally don ’ t get into supplements / training ( ? ) specific to one person . disregard my alkaline diet foray and my homemade colloidal silver . ; - ) i ’ m sorry i didn ’ t put a link . i thought this looked a little hokey at first , but quickly realized it was a very serious medical lecture . .https : / / youtu.be / mior _ wrkrauvery good link . puts things in perspective . thanks.please share links ! i ’ m sorry i didn ’ t put a link . i thought this link looked a little hokey at first , but quickly realized it was a very serious medical lecture . . https : / / youtu.be / mior _ wrkrauany peer-reviewed references in that video ? https : / / youtu.be / mior _ wrkrau check it out . very advanced university medical lecture that blew my mind.thanks for your great addition here ! you remind me of dr. greger ’ s video on the “ brain-gut connection ” .i watched that video , the interesting part is that our exposure to outside world through our guts is even more than skin ! that itself is sufficient to explain the role of our gut & what we eat in our overall health . despite general thought considering gut as a tube for passage of food , our gut determines our overall health by digestion , absorption of nutritious elements necessary for our growth & development , processing thousands of antigens and … furthermore our eating habits can reflect our emotions ( e.g. emotional eating ) . one can benefit from a balanced nutrition not only through having healthy , strong body but emotional stability , which is necessary for prospering.no doubt diverticulosis propensity will be multifactorial and not just a fiber issue . hydration , psychoemotional stress load , and activity level , can influence peristalsis and stool firmness . microbiome health and even infection effect stool consistency and intestinal epithelial health ; not forgetting 55-60 % of stool bulk is intestinal bacteria . and i suspect the mechanical effects of poor posture may directly compromise peristalsis and indirectly via compromised autonomic nerve control.given the rural african staple has been low-to-moderate fiber corn meal for some time , the real answer to their low diverticulosis risk might not be just fiber , but resistant starch and prebiotic dietary components generally . add under a cup of cornstarch to a diet , with just 1.8 g fiber ( 7 % intake ) , and fecal weight jumps 30 % , probably bacterial mass . one can treat constipation in rats with resistant starch and prebiotic polysaccharides . and in a small clinical study , the prebiotic lactulose was about as effective as fiber in diverticular management.what would it take to persuade you to do a blog . once a week , once a month … anything . we need you darryl . others have said it … you know its true. quit your day job and dedicate your life to we the living.btw / i read the ref ’ s you listed on fasting … i decided to try it for a day … i got to 11 : 30 am and caved . i wonder how a person can fast if they work and need to think on an empty tum tum ? jeewanu , i have been practicing daily intermittent fasting for two years . my feeding window is basically 12 : 30-20 : 30 , give or take half an hour . i work in a psychiatric hospital . i arrive at 7 : 15 and over the course of the next hour drink two cups of coffee as i review medical records of the newly-admitted patients . from that point on i virtually always have a cup of some sort of tea in my hand . i have absolutely no desire for food until lunch . i ’ m sure all that liquid sloshing around my stomach has something to do with it , but it also apparent that my organism has adapted . it takes a few weeks to become accustomed to this pattern of eating , but once you do it ’ s a piece of cake ( haha ) . ori hofmekler has written extensively on if and one comment he made really stayed with me . he said that one must “ endure hunger ” just as one endures exercise. ie. sort of like nike ’ s slogan “ just do it . ” well i have been saying that i want to drink more green tea . i ’ ll give it a try , thanksi ’ d agree with the “ endure hunger ” idea . if you don ’ t experience hunger now and then … you forget what it feels like . i ’ ve sometimes gotten into a thing where i ’ m seeming to continually trying to keep blood sugar levels at a high point … a sure way to gain weight and make oneself sick . just stop … experience hunger.in summer i keep a gallon of green tea / ginseng / lemon cold brewed tea in the fridge … only 6 bags per gallon … but it is refreshing.i object to the misnomer intermittent fasting . waiting until noon to eat is barely a fast as it merely amounts to skipping breakfast , a common practice . current ifers are just time shifting.in my book , intermittent fasting is eating every other day , e.g. , water fast monday , wednesday , friday , sunday , etc . , and eating tuesday , thursday , saturday , monday , etc.great idea , jeewanu . i suggest we crowd source some funding and get dr. greger to pay darryl for all his helpful commentary . anybody with me ? if he has the time and interest that would be great . but this thread is getting old . if we want to start a grass-roots movement we should repost early after next vid goes up . darryl , if you are a dillitante then i ’ m a non-existant scottish sea-serpent with polygonal fins ! i also tried my first 36 hr fast or “ calorie restriction ” . ate just 300 cal , 32g was protein , i didn ’ t want to mess up my hard fought muscle in the process . drank a gal of water and tea . the only thing i noticed was a prickly feeling in my head and arms . got on the scales when i was done and see i lost near 4lb . i don ’ t have to go to work , but did the shopping and light cardio exercise.well after doing that it should be easy for me to cut my feeding window to around 8 hrs a day.i stumbled upon this paper that describes 4 kinds of resistant starch . corn is type 1 i think . 2 is raw granules from potato or banana. the other 2 sound like artefacts of cooking or processing ( like the baked goods you described right ? ) . would you have an opinion on the best sources for gut health ? my wife is sensitive to corn so we are looking for alternatives.http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1111 / j.1541-4337.2006.tb00076.x / epdfmost will varieties of type 3 , with the amounts of rs determined by amylose ( linear starch ) content and preparation . higher amylose content is found in beans , but even lower amylose starches like refined wheat pasta and potatoes will develop significant amounts of rs through retrogradation as they cool after cooking ( which can increase further as leftovers are reheated ) . for example , the caloric staple of rural east & southern africa is a refined corn meal polenta , but its generally eaten throughout the day after its cooled and undergone retrogradation . generally , starchy foods with lower glycemic indices ( gi ) have higher amounts of rs , inviting speculation that its higher rs content , rather than limited glycemic spikes , that may account for the health benefits of low gi foods . this page ( focused on gi ) offers an approachable description of some preparation details.much corn , however , is low in amylose and high in amylopectin , which is not resistant. http : / / www.montignac.com / en / the-factors-that-modify-glycemic-indexes / witner told me this about that special cornmeal from africa : “ the resistant starch used in the south african / african american study ( and in more than 70 additional clinical trials ) was hi-maize resistant starch from high amylose corn . you can buy it at kingarthurflour.com or on amazon . king arthur calls it hi-maize natural fiber . ” more at https : / / disqus.com / home / discussion / nutritionfacts / solving _ a _ colon _ cancer _ mystery / # comment-2130421408darryl , is it ok if i quote your following comment in a chapter on cell signalling for a book i ’ m writing on diet and cancer ? if so , how would you like to be identified ? “ its a really fascinating tangle of wires down there on the switchboards . no person well ever have a complete knowledge of the network , but the regulatory hubs are fewer and more comprehensible . less than a dozen , including nf-kb , nrf2 , ampk , mtor , sirt1 , ppar etc. pop up repeatedly in the past decade ’ s literature on nutrition and disease prevention at the cellular level . in a few decades , some of these will be as familiar as “ spleen ” or “ pancreas ” , at least to those who want to know why some diets prevent disease ” i would just like to add that the “ staple ” african maize consumed by those mentioned in the study from baragwanath hospital in johannesburg is hardly cornstarch . cornstarch is much higher refined . we are talking more the consistency of what i believe americans call grits . what the study does not take into account is that for centuries , another “ staple ” in the aforementioned diet is mageu – a lactic acid-fermented maize drink made from fermented cooked maize meal porridge that undergoes the same fermentation process as yoghurt . perhaps the presence of probiotics might account for some the healthier results.off topic but within the rules , i believe : have you seen the very recent web blitz on heavy metals ( particularly thallium ) in cruciferous vegetables ( particularly kale ) as a source of subtle poisoning among those consuming a lot of those foods ? apparently the reporting starts with a story in craftsmanship ( ! ) on the work of an enterprising microbiologist purporting to show that at least some crucifers , and perhaps other leafy greens bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals from the soil ( in the soil from uncertain sources , but if anything more concentrated in these vegetables when organically grown ) . i would find this easier to dismiss if my partner and i , both gregeresque , esselstynish wfpb enthusiasts who have been serving up cooked kale as a generous part of most most dinners — were not heavily prone to the kinds of vague complaints cited in the article . if dr. greger , joseph gonzales or the estimable darryl would be willing to take a look and respond i would very much appreciate it . meanwhile , i think i ’ m planning a millet-and-squash dinner tonight ( ! ) thanks , jack psorry , i left out the link i ’ d intended to post in my query above re : kale and thalliumhttp : / / craftsmanship.net / the-vegetable-detective / cruciferous vegetables * can * accumulate thallium from soil ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) , as can other vegetables like beets and spinach . the major concern isn ’ t with contamination by human activity , but soils derived from naturally thallium-rich bedrocks , which can elevate levels to much higher levels . this is the case for parts of china ( 4 ) and the czech republic ( 5 ) .there is some detectable thallium in most u.s. topsoils , but the mean and medium of row crop topsoils in california ( where most vegetables are grown ) was a “ low ” 0.3 mg / kg , while the maximum was only 0.6 mg / kg.and how about this , sunflower seeds known to draw lead out of the soil.http : / / slingshot.tao.ca / issue.html ? 0099001thanks , darryl . i ’ ve followed your links ; i think on the whole they lend credence to to the possibility of too much of the crucifers maybe sometimes leading to thallium toxicity . sheesh ! we thought they were the most heroic vegetables and that overdoing them would have to be on the scale of the woman who landed in the hospital with severe thryroid trouble after living on practically nothing but ( raw , i think ) bok choy . we ’ re not kale-eaters on that scale , but i do think we ’ ll cut back , even cut it and the rest of the cabbage family out for a while , and see if we ’ re better for it . could take a while to tell , though … i don ’ t think heavy metal clearance is a quick project . thanks again ! as greater cruciferous vegetable intake appears to have entirely positive effects , testing may be an option to allay your concerns . urine and whole blood thallium tests run around $ 45 ( to providers ) , and are widely available as they ’ re used to monitor industrial exposures . chronic thallium poisoning manifests as white streaks in fingernails ( mee ’ s lines ) , anorexia , headache , and pains in abdomen , upper arms and thigh . i eat about a pound of california grown kale weekly in the context of a whole plant based diet , my nails are unstreaked , and i ’ ve never felt better.thanks for the testing tip . we don ’ t keep up with your kale and broccoli consumption ( though we fill in with a fair amount of arugula and some other crucifers ) . i know we ’ re grasping at straws here , but that ’ s perhaps what one does after a few years of exquisitely faithful wfpb diet and vague failure to thrive ( symptoms that do not include mee ’ s lines ( ! ) ) we ’ ve been on antiretroviral drugs for 19 years – after near death – and our docs are , on the whole , pleased with us . we think their standards need raising.well , on the off-chance that high crucifer intake might , for some idiosyncratic reason , have caused thallium toxicity in this household … sounds like the pretty high potassium intake in our diet ( even with reduced kale ! ) should help to speed excess thallium out through the kidneys . that ’ s good – perhaps not such a slow trial as i ’ d expected . thanksthat is a very interesting article . i ’ ve cut out kale lately to see if it makes a difference in my digestive problems . am going back to eating the veges more like i used to because something isn ’ t agreeing with me with all this “ healthier eating ” .adopting a wfpb diet is a great start but some folks continue to have difficulties . i think it is certainly reasonable to try and id plants that may be at fault . this can be done one food at a time or one can try a diet such as the one recommended by dr. mcdougall … he calls it the “ diet for the desperate ” and it is explained in his december 2002 newsletter article by that title . it is good to minimize one ’ s exposure to persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals but there are issues beyond exposure such as absorption . dr. greger addresses many of these issues in his video on cadmium see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cadmium-and-cancer-plant-vs-animal-foods / . it is also to be aware of the sources of heavy metal . i wasn ’ t able to find a video on thallium … maybe a topic for a future video ? ? an “ enterprising microbiologist ” who just happens to have ties with a company producing some purported heavy metal detoxifier … .

my comment was only about that particular 2013 study , nothing more.what about the addition of diatomaceous earth in your diet ? i would not suggest it . the fda has a few documents on diatomaceous earth here and here . i posted an older comment here for another person who asked about its use . it seems very little research , if any , exists on toxicity and safety in human trials.as far as i can see diatomaceous earth is only good for putting around pet beds and lounging areas to kill fleas . not sure it even does a good job of that.thank you dr. greger for the great explanation with illustrations of what diverticulosis is , the precursor to diverticulitis . i have helped many people over the years with acute diverticulitis who were facing surgery to avoid that surgery . it took more than changing diet and adding probiotics . in the narrow window of time given in those situations , a comprehensive herbal colon cleanse alongside proper daily hydration , nutrient dense fiber rich mostly plant based whole foods diet , supplemental digestive enzymes and supplemental probiotics were all required . the good news is that this approach is totally safe and effective for most people as long as they take the time to become properly educated about their condition , be willing to take responsibility for healing themselves with proper guidance , and that would include the responsibility of seeking medical attention if they experience another attack in the course of clearing out their colons ; which is a distinct possibility . fortunately in the cases i have worked with , additional attacks did not happen . clearly the best thing to do is to prevent diverticulosis / diverticulitis from happening in the first place . and , it ’ s important to know that there are safe and effective remedies even for those people who have already suffered from this increasing common and very uncomfortable experience . not only can diverticulosis-diverticulitis be prevented it can be completely reversed , cleaned out and healed , so that a normal , properly functioning colon has been restored . russell mariani , director , the center for functional nutrition , author , healing digestive illness.russell mariani knows his stuff and speaks the truth . if you ’ re suffering i highly recommend reading his book.fascinating report here ! mind-blowing really . anyway . i have a question.dr greger and many others often refer to the “ vegan diet . ” however , after studying the topic for about three years , i ’ ve come to appreciate only recently how many vegans eat what we might describes as “ the vegan sad diet . ” this is sad just with no animal foods . so , lot ’ s of fried or high fat foods , processed foods , refined foods , sugar foods , etc etc . question : what proportion are “ unhealthy vegans ” ? are they the rule or the exception to the rule ? 10 % ? over 50 % ? 80 % ? do we know ? how can we know ? judging by cookbook titles , i ’ d say the majority of younger vegans fall into that category . followers of drs. campbell , esselstyn , barnard , fuhrman , greger et al. often use the phrase “ whole-food , plant-based diet ” to distinguish their health-oriented vegan diets.ahem ! by those images , veganism represents a sugary cupcake revolution ! it seems that veganism does not offer a positive human food agenda . it focuses only on a negative food agenda , which is : “ do not eat animal protein. period . ” that ’ s all well and good . they aren ’ t dietitians after all . that ’ s not their purpose . problems arise though when vegan followers infer some “ positive advice ” in veganism on human ways of eating , which doesn ’ t exist , so before you know it … anything goes , as long as it ’ s not animals . cupcake heaven . it all comes down to your interpretation.this doesn ’ t seem to be a failure of veganism per se . they accomplish their largely laudable aims whenever a new person stops eating animal protein . instead , it ’ s a failure of those who become vegans to think hard enough about optimal ways to eat . veganism though opens the door for such failures . ( and now that the program has been laid out , it ’ s hard to change course . ) to whom are you speaking ? the majority of us here are wfpb eaters and are quite aware of the “ sad vegan ” ways . i won ’ t use the term “ vegan ” to describe my way of eating because i ’ m not 100 % no animal and also because i wear leather boots and belts and woolen socks , use antler , bone , and horn for handles … etc.i do believe that part of dr. greger ’ s drive is to help the “ sad vegans ” learn to be truly healthy and not the “ vegans ” that drag down the statistical results when veggie / veganism is considered . ( it ’ s such a small group that we all get lumped in together nearly every time ) .if i was going to “ go nuts ” over a dietary category it would be “ vegetarian ” . makes no sense to me how excluding flesh but including eggs ( unborn flesh ) and mammary gland secretions ( white poison ) could ever be considered healthful or a “ veggie ” way of life . dairy is the first thing i learned was killing me silently-via sinus issues . eggs , holy hell-bacon is more healthful.kudos to you for resolving your sinus issue by stopping milk products.dr greger and others often refer to vegans or vegan diets . it ’ s a common idea that veganism suggests some type of a diet for humans . as far as i can tell , at least in the dietary domain , veganism only says don ’ t eat animal products . period . that ’ s it . there is no “ vegan diet ” , it makes no suggestions beyond the negative “ no animals ” so vegans can eat in a wide variety of ways , some healthy , some unhealthy ( what we might call sad vegan-style ) . it makes sense because they don ’ t focus on diet specifically but on animal rights . if you convert from eating animal foods to not consuming them , then veganism has another victory . good for them but goodness help the vegan who selects the sad vegan-style option . does veganism care ? no.i agree that the “ vegetarian ” word could use some serious shaping up . i go to moe ’ s southwest grill for a quite healthy vegetarian burrito and before i can specify toppings the server is throwing cheese on my wrap . ahem ! i ’ m like cheese is vegetarian ? he shrugs his shoulders . but milk and eggs products have become such an ingrained part of what most think of as vegetarian that to an extent we accept it . we use words as they are commonly used i guess and not as we ’ d like them to be used . i normally say “ strict vegetarian ” but still folks eyes still probably glaze over with that one . : ( here is a link where one can find nf translated to portuguese so we can share with our family and friends who don ’ t understand english fully – http : / / nf.focoempatico.net / diverticulose-doenca-intestinal-mais-comum / there is a movement to reduce the world ’ s population and one means is through compromising people ’ s health . it is ridiculous that “ science ” exists like the study masterimpatient pointed out and dr. greger will point out . i love science , but it has brought as much ill into the world as it has good , and maybe even more . ~ http : / / www.naturallifeenergy.com / godawakeningdiet / in the china study and other more recent looks at wfpb lifestyles , sweet potatoes seem to be a huge answer in the search for health . is it because people fill up on them rather than eating a lot of fat ? is it because people fill up on them rather than chowing down chicken which has arachidonic acid which causes inflammation to go through the roof , or could it be that sweet potatoes have a lot of vegetable fiber because they ’ re actually not a potato , they ’ re a vegetable . you can google that one . is it because they have potassium ? biggest question … does it really matter ? why can ’ t we all just start eating a lot more of them . i see lot ’ s of people ordering chicken burritos , but finding anything sweet potato fast for lunch or on the go is almost impossible to find . btw , there are 29 varieties of sweet potato . where are they ? there ’ s only one kind at the supermarket . if you want a link on this one , it ’ s all from the china study.there are perhaps many reasons why sweet potatoes are so healthful . fun fact : they have three times the beta-carotene as carrots ! the china study has such valuable information . thanks for sharing this , randy and let us know when you try all 29 varieties of sweet potatoes ; - ) that sounds marvelous . african americans , aging , bladder health , colon disease , colon health , diverticulitis , diverticulosis , dr. denis burkitt , dr. neil painter , fiber , grains , intestinal health , meat , mortality , pain , plant-based diets , stool size , sugar , uganda more than two-thirds of americans over age 60 have diverticulosis , but it was nearly unknown a century ago and remained extremely rare among populations eating whole food plant-based diets . just in the last few weeks i ’ ve come out with a few on this similar theme of bowel health : what if your doctor tells you that you shouldn ’ t eat healthy foods like nuts and popcorn because of your diverticulosis ? share with them my video diverticulosis & nuts.sorry for the cliff-hanger , but i ’ m really trying to be good about limiting how long my videos get . stay tuned for does fiber really prevent diverticulosis ?
PLAIN-2439	from table to able : combating disabling diseases with food for those of you unfamiliar with my work , every year i read through every issue of every english-language nutrition journal in the world-so you , don 't have to . every year my talks are brand-new because every year the science is brand-new . i then compile all the most interesting , the most groundbreaking , the most practical findings to create new videos and articles every day , for my nonprofit site , nutritionfacts.org. everything on the website is free . there 's no ads , no corporate sponsorship , it 's strictly noncommercial ; i 'm not selling anything . i just put it up as a public service . it exists because thousands of people donate to support the 501c3 nonprofit charity that keeps it alive . and thanks to your support , in less than 3 years nutritionfacts.org has ramped up to a total of ... 25 million pageviews , now with more than a million new hits a month . people are hungry , for evidence-based nutrition . in my 2012 year-in-review , i explored the role a healthy diet may play in preventing , arresting , and reversing our deadliest diseases . in 2013 i covered our most common conditions . this year i thought i 'd address some of our leading causes of , disability . we want to live a long life , not a long miserable one . heart disease , is not only our leading cause of death , but also our leading cause of death , and disability . dr. dean ornish , showed that on his plant-based diet and lifestyle program , cardiac patients , had a 91 % reduction in angina attacks ( that 's the crushing chest pain people with advanced heart disease can get ) . in contrast , control group patients who were instead told to listen to the advice of their doctors , had a 186 % increase , in attacks . this marked reduction in chest pain was sustained 5 years later , a long-term reduction in angina comparable to that of bypass surgery , but without the knife , or the saw , used to cut our chest in half . forks over knives ; soup over saws but this was back in the 90s when ornish was only studying a few dozen patients at a time . how about a thousand patients on a whole foods plant-based diet . within 3 months , nearly three quarters of angina patients became angina free . 74 % cured without a single scalpel or side-effect . now ornish didn 't just put people on a plant-based diet . he also advised moderate exercise like walking . so how do we know what role the diet played ? well if you go back to ornish 's first publication , he put cardiac patients on a quasi-vegan diet , with no added exercise-just diet and stress management-and got a 91 % reduction in angina attacks in less than a month . and dr. esselstyn was able to improve angina using a plant-based diet as the only lifestyle intervention , so we know the diet is the active ingredient . but they weren 't the first . there are published case series going back to the 1970s . we 've known about this for decades . angina and the vegan diet. like mr. f.w. here . chest pain so severe he had to stop every 9 or 10 steps . started on a vegan diet-and not even a low fat vegan diet-and months later , climbed mountains , no pain.this may be , because vegetarian arteries , dilate four times better , than the arteries of omnivores . put people on a plant-based diet for a year and their clogged arteries can literally get cleaned out ... 20 % less atherosclerotic plaque in their arteries at the end of the year than at the beginning . put people on a low carb diet , though , and their condition worsens . 40 to 50 % more artery clogging at the end of the year . here are some representative heart scans . the yellow and particularly red represent blood flow through the coronary arteries to the heart muscle . this patient went on a plant-based diet and their arteries opened right up increasing the blood flow . this person , however , started out with good flow , but after a year on a low carb diet , their blood flow significantly clogged down.this is not just measuring risk factors , but actual blood flow to people 's hearts on plant-based versus low carb diets . no wonder a recent meta-analysis found that low-carb diets were associated with a significantly higher risk of death-all-cause mortality in the long run , meaning those on low carb diets live , on average , significantly shorter lives . there is a new category of anti-angina drugs , but before committing billions of dollars of public and private monies to dishing them out , maybe we should take a more serious look at dietary strategies . to date , these strategies have been marginalized by the ‘ drug pusher ' mentality of orthodox medical practice ; presumably , doctors feel that most patients will be unwilling or unable to make the substantial dietary changes required . while this may be true for many patients , it certainly is not true for all . and , in any case , angina patients deserve to be offered the plant-based diet alternative before being shunted to expensive surgery or to drug therapies that can have a range of side effects and never really get to the root of the problem . in response to this paper , a drug company executive wrote a letter to the medical journal : although diet and lifestyle modifications should be a part of disease management , he said , many patients may not be able to comply with the substantial dietary changes required to achieve a vegan diet ( so of course everyone should go on their fancy new drug ) , called ranolazine . costs over $ 2000 a year to take it but the side effects aren 't , horrible , and the drug works . collectively , the studies show that at the highest dose , ranolazine , sold as ranexa , may prolong exercise duration as long as 33 and half seconds . it does not look like those choosing the drug route , will be climbing mountains anytime soon . plant-based diets aren 't just safer and cheaper ; they worked , better . i 've talked about copd as a leading killer , what about , low back pain , like sciatica.low back pain , became one of the biggest problems for public health systems , in the western world , during the second half , of the 20th century . chronic low back pain now affects about 1 in 5 , disabling over 30 million americans-it 's an epidemic . are people just lifting more heavy stuff ? no . mechanical factors , such as lifting and carrying , probably do not have a major role in this disease . well then what causes it ? i 've touched on it before , atherosclerosis can obstruct the arteries that feed the spine and it 's this diminished blood flow that can cause back problems . this can be seen on angiography , showing normal spinal arteries on the left and clogged on the right , or on autopsy , where you can see how the openings to the spinal arteries can get squeezed shut by these cholesterol filled plaques on the right . autopsy , because back pain may predict fatal heart disease , just like clogs in the penile arteries-erectile dysfunction , can precede heart attacks , because it 's the same disease-inflamed clogged crippled arteries throughout our body . now we have mri imaging , that can show the occlusion of spinal arteries in people with back pain , and the degeneration of the disks-all linked to high cholesterol . those with narrowed arteries appear about 8 and a half times more likely to suffer from chronic low back pain . this makes sense . the disks in our lower back are the largest avascular tissue in the body , meaning our disks don 't have any blood vessels . thus , their nutrition just kinds of diffuses in from the margins , making them especially vulnerable to deprivation . using mris you can measure the effects of impaired blood flow on that diffusion , and see how this can turn into that . by age 49 , 97 % , of the disks of those eating the standard american diet show at least grade 2 degradation . starting , in our teens , our disks are already starting to degenerate ... starting , around age 11 ... as i 've talked about , nearly all kids have the beginnings of atherosclerosis by age 10 in this country.and sadly , low back pain is now common in children and adolescents , and it 's getting worse . just like kids now getting adult-onset diabetes , teenagers starting their lives out with a chronic disease . that 's why it 's never too early to start eating healthier to clean out the arteries in our heart , our spine , and throughout our bodies . to get you back into circulation , you need to get circulation , to your back . skipping down a few in the interest of time , having a stroke can be severely disabling . thankfully , high dietary fiber intake , which is to say whole plant foods , may help prevent strokes as well . the belief that dietary fiber intake is protectively associated to some chronic disease was postulated 40 years ago and then enormously fuelled and kept alive by a great body of science since . today it is therefore generally believed that eating lots of fiber , meaning eating a lot of unprocessed plant foods , helps prevent obesity , diabetes and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke . strokes are the second most common cause of death worldwide. and a leading cause of disability and so preventing strokes in the first place-what 's called primary prevention should , therefore , be a key public health priority . based on all the best studies to date , different strokes for different folks , depending , evidently , on how much fiber they eat . notably , increasing fiber just 7 grams a day was associated with a 7 % reduction in stroke risk . and 7 grams is easy , like a small serving of whole grain pasta with tomato sauce , and an apple . but if you really don 't want a stroke , we should try to get 25 grams a day of soluble fiber , which is found in beans , oats , nuts , and berries , and 47 grams a day of insoluble fiber , found primarily in whole grains . one would have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to get a total of 72 grams of fiber a day-huge amounts of plants . yet these cut-off values could be considered as the minimum recommended daily intake of fiber , to prevent stroke . they admit these minimums are higher than those commonly and arbitrarily proposed as “ adequate , ” but do we want to be patronized to , as to what authorities think is practical , or do we want them to just tell us what the science says , like they did here ? someone funded by kellogg 's wrote in to complain that in practice such fiber intakes are unachievable , rather , the message should just be the more , the better , yaknow , just have a bowl of cereal or something , wink-wink . the real dr. kellogg , who was actually one of our most famous physicians , credited for being one of the first to sound the alarm about smoking , may have been the first american physician , to have recognized the field of nutrition as a science , would today be rolling in his grave , if he knew what his company had become . diabetes-our 7th leading cause of , loss-of-life , is also our 8th leading cause , of loss-of-health . up to 50 % of diabetics eventually develop neuropathy , damage to their nerves . it can be very painful , and the pain is frequently resistant to conventional treatments . in fact there is supposedly no effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy . us doctors are just left with steroids , opiates , and antidepressants , to try to mediate , the suffering.but ... 20 years ago , a remarkable study was published on the regression , the reversal of diabetic neuropathy with a plant-based diet . twenty-one diabetics suffering with moderate or worse painful neuropathy for up to 10 years were placed on a whole food , plant-based diet . years and years of suffering and then , complete relief of the pain in 17 out of the 21 patients , within days .... numbness noticeably improved too . and the side-effects were all good . they lost 10 pounds , blood sugars got better-insulin needs dropped in half , and in five of the patients not , only was their painful neuropathy cured , so was , apparently , their diabetes . normal blood sugars off of all medications . diabetics for up to 20 years and then off all drugs in a matter of weeks . and their triglycerides and cholesterol improved too . high blood pressures got better . in fact gone in about half the hypertensives-an 80 % drop overall in the need for high blood pressure medications within 3 weeks . but we 've known that plant-based diets can reverse diabetes and hypertension , but this was new . years of painful suffering , and then complete relief of the pain in 80 % , within days.now this was a live-in program , where patients meals were provided . what happened after they were sent home and went back to the real world ? the 17 folks were followed for years , and in all except one , the relief from the painful neuropathy continued , or improved even further . how 'd they get that kind of compliance with a strict plant-based diet ? because , it works ... one of the most painful and frustrating-conditions-to-treat in all of medicine , and three quarters cured in a couple days with a natural , nontoxic-in fact beneficial-treatment , a diet composed of whole plant foods . should have been front-page headline news ... how could nerve damage be reversed so suddenly ? it didn 't appear to be the improvement in blood sugar control , since it took about 10 days for the diet to control the diabetes , whereas the pain was gone in as few as four . there are several mechanisms by which the total vegetarian diet works to alleviate the problem of diabetic neuropathy as well as the diabetic condition itself . their most interesting speculation was that it could be the trans fats naturally found in meat and dairy that could be causing an inflammatory response . they found a significant percentage of the fat under the skin of those who eat meat or even just dairy and eggs was trans fats . trans fats inside their bodies , under their skin , whereas those who had been on a strictly whole food plant-based diet had no detectable trans fat in their tissues . the researchers stuck needles in the buttocks of people eating different diets , and nine months or more on a strict plant-based diet appeared to remove all the trans fat from their bodies , or at least their butts . but their pain didn 't take 9 months to get better ; it got better in more like 9 days . more likely , the amazing reversal was due to an improvement in blood flow . nerve biopsies in diabetics with severe progressive neuropathy have shown arterial disease within the nerve . there are blood vessels within our nerves that can get clogged up too , depriving the nerves of oxygen , presumably leading them to cry out in pain . within days , though , improvements in blood “ rheology , ” meaning the ease at which blood flows on a plant-based diet may play a prominent role in the reversal of diabetic neuropathy ... plant-based diets may also lower the level of igf-1 inside the eyeballs of diabetics and decrease the risk of retinopathy-diabetic vision loss-as well . but what about treating retinopathy ? kempner at duke used a plant-based diet of mostly rice and fruit , to document for the first time the reversal of diabetic retinopathy in a quarter of his patients , something never even thought possible . for example , 60 year old diabetic woman already blind in one eye and can only see contours of large objects with the other , effectively blind . five years later on the diet , instead of it getting worst , she got better . she could then make out faces , see signs , large newspaper print . ( in addition to being off insulin , with normal blood sugars and 100 point drop in her cholesterol ) . the most efficient way to avoid diabetic complications is to eliminate , the diabetes in the first place , and this is often feasible for those type 2 patients who make an abiding commitment to daily exercise and a healthy enough diet . type 2 diabetes can be eliminated , reversed-cured with diet , and so , evidently , can some of its complications since the initial report of neuropathy reversal , the results have been replicated by other researchers . why didn 't we learn about this in medical school ? the neglect , of this important work by the broader medical community is little short of unconscionable ...... alzheimer 's disease perhaps best captures the difference between lifespan and healthspan . who cares if you live to be 100 if , in the last years of your life , you don 't recognize yourself in the mirror . in 1901 , auguste was taken to an insane asylum by her husband . she was described as a delusional , forgetful , disoriented woman who , tragically , could not carry out her homemaking duties . she was seen by a dr. , alzheimer , and was to become the case that made his a household name . on autopsy , he described the plaques and tangles in her brain that would go on to characterize the condition , but lost in the excitement of discovering a new disease , a clue may have been overlooked . he described atherosclerotic changes-hardening of the arteries-within her brain.we typically think of artery clogging in the heart , but as we saw with the spine and the nerves , atherosclerosis involves virtually the entire human organism . our whole vascular tree . including our brain . one of the most poignant examples of the systemic nature of clogged arteries is the link between coronary artery disease , degenerative brain disease , and dementia just as a heart attack or brain attack-stroke-can be significantly prevented , one can think of alzheimer 's dementia as a ‘ ‘ mind attack . " mind attack , like heart attacks or strokes , needs to be prevented by controlling vascular risk factors like high blood pressure and cholesterol , controlling chronic brain hypoperfusion , the lack of adequate blood flow to the brain over the years before the onset of alzheimer 's disease . we now we have a substantial body of evidence that strongly associates atherosclerotic vascular disease with alzheimer 's . autopsy studies , for example , have shown that individuals with alzheimer 's have significantly more atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries within their brain this is what our cerebral arteries should look like : open , clean , allowing blood to flow . this is what atherosclerosis in our brain arteries looks like . clogged with fat and cholesterol , closing off the artery , restricting blood flow to our brain ... which kind of arteries , do you want , in your brain ? ... this reduction of blood flow can starve the brain of oxygen , cause silent little mini-strokes , brain atrophy--shrinkage , the cumulative effects of which appear to play a pivotal role in accelerating and augmenting the development and evolution of alzheimer 's . but what about the role of metals in alzheimer 's ? the metals appear to just aggravate the detrimental effects of a high intake of cholesterol and saturated fat.what about the so-called alzheimer 's gene , apoe4 ? diet trumps genes . the highest frequency of the alzheimer 's gene in the world is in nigeria , but they also have some of the lowest alzheimer 's rates . to understand why , one has to understand the role of apoe . what does the gene do ? the alzheimer 's gene makes the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain , but if your cholesterol is low enough , because your diet is low enough in animal fat . if you center your diet around grains and vegetables ... then changes in cholesterol may lead to changes in alzheimer 's gene expression . just because we may have been dealt some bad genetic cards , doesn 't mean we can 't reshuffle the deck , with diet . according to the latest guidelines for the prevention of alzheimer 's ... the two most important things we can do , is cut down our consumption of meat , dairy , and junk and replace them with : vegetables , beans , fruits and whole grains . wait , grains protective of the brain ? i had the distinction this year of serving on a panel with grain brain author dr. perlmutter , who sold lots of books claiming carbs are destroying our brain , but what does the science show ? take japan , for example , where the prevalence of dementia has shot up over the last few decades . mechanisms to explain increases in alzheimers include increases in animal products . traditional diets generally are weighted toward vegetable products such as grains and away from animal products , but since 1960 , the diet in japan has changed from a more traditional rice-based diet to one with a preponderance of meat . so less grain , more alzheimer 's the dietary factor most strongly associated with the rise in alzheimer 's disease in japan was the increased consumption of animal fat . so it may be less grain-brain and more meathead . a similar analysis in china arrived at the same conclusion . on the basis of these findings , the rate of alzheimer 's disease and dementia will continue to rise unless dietary patterns change to those with less reliance on animal products . this is consistent with data showing those who eat vegetarian appear 2 to 3 times less likely to become demented , and the longer one eats meat-free , the lower the associated risk of dementia.in fact , where are the lowest rates of alzheimer 's in the world ? rural india . it may be no coincidence that the country with the lowest rates of alzheimers , has among the lowest rates of meat consumption , with 40 % of indians eating meat-free and egg-free diets , that are high grain , high bean , high carb diets . population studies have found grains to be strongly protective , in relation to alzheimer 's disease . the science shows the exact opposite of what one may read in the popular press . in other words , don 't pass on the grain pass the grain , to spare the brain . the link between arterial blockage and alzheimer 's is good news because atherosclerosis can be prevented and reversed , suggesting that strategies proven to delay the progression of atherosclerosis may be useful for preventing or treating alzheimer 's as well.so let 's put it to the test . if you follow people just starting to lose their faculties , the cognition of those with the least artery-clogging in their heads remains pretty stable over the years . but those with more cholesterol buildup got worse , and those with the most blockage , rapidly declined . and the same with the ability to carry out one 's activities of daily living , like dressing yourself . and arterial disease doubled the progression to alzheimer 's ... in summary , an inefficient blood supply to the brain has very grave consequences on brain function . but does treatment of vascular risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol make a difference ? we didn 't know , until now . 300 patients with alzheimers , and those with their vascular risk factors treated showed significantly less decline , slowed progression of their disease . it is said that “ the goal of medicine is to provide patients with hope , and when there is no hope to offer understanding . ” well for the first time in the history of this disorder , we have the chance to provide alzheimer patients with hope.let me close with , cancer , a leading cause of death and disability . how many years of life , are lost to potentially preventable cancers ? every year more than 5 million expected years of life , are lost in the united states , to those three disabling cancers alone , lung cancer , colorectal cancer , and breast cancer . therefore , identifying and improving strategies for prevention of cancer remains a priority , especially since not more than 2 % of all human cancer is attributable to purely genetic factors . 2 % may be in our genes , but the rest involve external factors , particularly our diet . our skin is about 20 square feet . our lungs , flattened out , about a thousand square feet , but our intestines ? three thousand square feet of surface area counting all the little folds . what we eat , is our primary interface with out invironment . the most comprehensive summary of evidence , on diet and cancer ever compiled , recommends we eat mostly foods of plant origin to help prevent cancer . this means centering our diet around whole plant foods , not just whole grains and beans every day , but every meal ... and when it came to foods that may increase cancer risk they were similarly straightforward . unlike some other dietary guidelines that wimp out and just advise people to “ moderate ” their intake of bad foods , like : eat less candy . the cancer guidelines didn 't mince words when it came to the worst of the worst . for example , don 't just minimize soda intake , avoid it . don 't just cut back on bacon , ham , hot dogs , sausage and lunch meat , avoid processed meats , period , because data do not show any level of intake that can confidently be shown not to be associated with risk . even small amounts are risky . processed meat ... cannot only be thought of as a powerful multi-organ carcinogen , but may increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes . red meat was bad , but processed meat was worst , and that included white meat , like chicken , and turkey slices . so with more heart disease , cancer , and diabetes it 's no surprise processed meat consumption has been associated with increased risk of death , even at small amounts . in europe , they calculated that reduction of processed meat consumption to less than half-a-hot-dog-a-day 's worth would prevent more than 3 % of all deaths . this is the kind of stuff we feed our kids . this was the second largest prospective study ever done on diet and cancer , a study of more than 400,000 people . the largest ever-600,000 , was done here in the us , the aarp study . they found the preventable fraction to be much higher , suggesting , for example , that 20 % of heart disease deaths among women could be averted if the highest consumers cut down to like less than a quarter-strip-of-bacon 's-worth a day-that 's how bad the stuff is . that is a lot of death . so what does the industry think about that ? in the journal meat science , the industry acknowledged that the cancer prevention guidelines now urge people to avoid processed meat , a statement that represents “ a clear and present danger ” ... for the meat industry . processed meat , they say , is a social necessity . how could anyone live without bologna ? the challenge for the meat industry is to find a way to maintain the consumption of these products while somehow not damaging public health . they 've considered removing the nitrites for decades because of the long known toxic effects ( the industry adds them to keep the meat pink ) . there are , evidently , other coloring additives available . nevertheless , it 's going to be hard to get the industry to change-you have to balance all the cancer with the positive effects of these substances as preservatives , and desirable flavour and red colour developing ingredients . no one wants , green eggs and ham . it 's like salt reduction in meat products . they 'd like to , but one of the biggest barriers to salt replacement within the meat industry is cost , as salt is one of the cheapest food ingredients available . now there a number of taste enhancers they can inject into the meat that can help compensate for the salt reduction , but some of the compounds leave a bitter after-taste so , they can also inject a patented bitter-blocking chemical that can prevent taste nerve stimulation at the same time , the first of what may become a stream of products that are produced due to the convergence of food technology and biotech.or they could always try adding nonmeat materials , to the meat . you could add fiber , or starch from beans that have protective effects against cancer . after all , in the united states dietary fiber is under-consumed by most adults , indicating that fiber fortification in meat products could have health benefits .... failing to note , of course , that their products are one of the reasons the american diet is so deficient in fiber in the first place . the industry is all in favor of causing less cancer but , obviously any such optimization has to achieve a healthier product without affecting the hedonic aspects . it is important to realize that nutritional and technological quality in the meat industry are inversely related . an improvement in one will lead to deterioration of the other . so you have to balance it out . they know that consumption of lard is not the best thing in the world , heart disease being our # 1 killer , however those downsides are in sharp contrast to lard 's technological qualities which makes saturated fats indispensable in the manufacture of meat products . otherwise you just don 't get , the same lard consistency . the pig 's fat doesn 't get hard enough , and as a result a fatty smear upon cutting or slicing can be observed on the cutting surface of the knife-so you have to have your priorities straight . although the evidence for the relationship between colorectal cancer risk ( at least ! ) and processed meats intake cannot be denied , the meat industry suggests further research . for example , compare the risk of consuming meat to other risky practices-alcohol , inactivity , obesity , and smoking . compared to lung cancer and smoking , maybe meat wouldn 't look so bad . but don 't worry , consumers probably won 't even ever hear about the latest cancer prevention guidelines . consumers today are overloaded with information . thus the industry can hope that the dissemination of the update on meat and cancer drowns in this information cloud . and even if consumers do see it , the industry doesn 't think they 'll much care . for many consumers in the western world , the role of healthfulness , although important , is not close to taste satisfaction in shaping their final choice of meat products . it is hence questionable that the revised recommendations based on the carcinogenic effects of meat consumption will yield substantial changes in consumer behavior . doctors and nutrition professionals feed into this patronizing attitude that people don 't care enough about their health to change . this paper , from a leading nutrition journal , scoffed at the idea that people would ever switch to a “ prudent diet , ” reducing their intakes of animal protein and fat no matter how much cancer was prevented . the chances of reducing consumption to avoid colon cancer ? virtually nil . consider heart disease . we know that we can prevent and treat heart disease with the same kind of diet , but the public just won 't do it . “ the diet , ” they say , “ would lose too much of its palatability . ” in other words , the great palatability of ham largely outweighs other considerations , although health and wellbeing are increasingly important factors in consumer decisions . this 1998 industry article feared that unless meat eating becomes compatible with eating that is healthy and wholesome it could be consigned to a minor role in the diet during the next decade . their prediction didn 't quite pan out . here 's meat consumption per person over about the last 30 years . rising , rising . 1998 was when the meat science article was published , worrying about the next decade of meat consumption , which rose even further , but then did seem to kind of flatten out , before it fell off a cliff . per capita meat consumption down about 10 % in recent years . millions of americans are cutting down on meat . so don 't tell me people aren 't willing to change their diets . yet we continue to get diluted dietary guidelines , because authorities are asking themselves : what dietary changes could be acceptable to the public , rather than just telling us what the science says and letting us make up our own minds as to whether ... pig fat smearing on knives should trump our families ' health . what we eat doesn 't just affect cancer risk in the colon . why do constipated women appear to be at higher risk for breast cancer , whereas women who have 3 or more bowel movements a day . superpoopers i call them . ( sounds like an abba song ) -appeared to cut their risk of breast cancer in half . this could be because constipation , means a greater contact time between our waste and our intestinal wall , which may increase the formation and absorption of fecal mutagens-compounds that can cause dna mutations and cancer-into the circulation , and then into the breast . we know that breasts actively take up chemical substances from the bloodstream , so researchers became concerned that substances originating in the colon might enter the bloodstream and reach the breast . specifically bile acids , which are formed as a way of getting rid of excess cholesterol . our liver dumps bile acids into the intestine for disposal , assuming our intestines will be packed with fiber to trap it and flush it out of the body , but if we haven 't been eating whole plant foods all day long , bile acids can be reabsorbed back into the body , and build up in the breast . carcinogenic bile acids are found concentrated in the breast at up to a hundred times the level found in the bloodstream-they just suck it up . by radioactively tagging bile acids they were able to show that intestinal bile acids rapidly gain access to the breast , where they can exert an estrogen-like cancer-promoting effect on breast tumor cells . this would explain why we see 50 % higher bile acid levels in newly diagnosed breast cancer victims . so how can we facilitate the removal of bile acids from our body ? well we can speed up the so-called oroanal transit time , the speed at which food goes from mouth to toilet , because slowed colon transit can increases bile acid absorption . but we can speed things up by eating lots of fiber . a diet packed with plants greatly increased bile acid excretion . fiber can bind up and remove toxic elements like lead and mercury , as well as cholesterol and bile acids . but plants can even bind bile acids independent of fiber . vegan diets , bind significantly more bile acid than lacto-ovo , or nonvegetarian diets , for example , even at the same fiber intake ... which could explain why it appears that individuals eating vegetarian might excrete less mutagenic , less mutation-causing feces in the first place . you 'll notice , that the same type of diet used to help lower cancer risk , is the same type of diet used to help prevent alzheimers , and diabetes , diabetic complications , and high blood pressure , and stroke , and back pain , and heart disease , a diet centered around whole plant foods -the type of diet eaten by populations that were largely free of many of our deadliest and debilitating diseases.heart disease was so rare among those eating these traditional plant-based diets , there were papers published like this . a case of coronary heart disease in an african . after 26 years of medical practice they finally recorded their first case of coronary heart disease among a population of 15 million-a judge , who had started consuming , a partially westernized diet ... some , thought it was the preponderance of whole plant foods , that protected these populations ; others thought it was the avoidance of animal foods . either way , they couldn 't prove it was the diet , until it was put to the test . pritikin , ornish , esselstyn , and others took people with heart disease and put them on the kind of plant-based diet followed by thesepopulations that didn 't suffer from heart disease , hoping it would stop the disease process , keep it from progressing further , but instead , something miraculous happened . their disease started to reverse , to get better . as soon as they stopped eating an artery-clogging diet , their bodies were able to start dissolving some of the plaque away , even in some cases of severe triple vessel heart disease , arteries opened up without drugs , without surgery , suggesting their bodies wanted to heal all along , but were just never given the chance . this is esselstyn 's new study , published four days ago . this increase in blood flow to the heart muscle on the left happened within just 3 weeks of eating healthy ... let me share with you the best kept secret in medicine ... the best kept secret in medicine is that , given the right conditions , the body heals itself . if you ... whack your shin really hard on a coffee table , it can get all red hot swollen painful but will heal naturally if we just stand back and let our body work its magic . but what if we kept whacking it in the same place three times a day ( breakfast , lunch , and dinner ) . it 'd never heal . you 'd go to your doctor and say my shin hurts . and the doctor would be like no problem , whip out their pad and write you a prescription for , painkillers . you 're still whacking your shin three times a day and it still hurts like heck , but feels so much better with the pain pills . thank heavens for modern medicine . it 's like when people take nitroglycerine for chest pain , tremendous relief , but you 're not doing anything to treat the underlying cause . our body wants , to come back to health , if we let it . but if we keep re-injuring it three times a day we may never heal . it 's like smoking . one of the most amazing things i learned in medical school was that within 10 years of stopping smoking , our lung cancer risk approaches that of a lifelong nonsmoker . isn 't that amazing ? our lungs can clear out all that tar , and eventually , it 's almost like we never started smoking at all . our body wants to be healthy . and every morning of our smoking life that healing process started until ... bam , our first cigarette , reinjuring our lungs with every puff , just like we can reinjure our arteries with every bite , when all we had to do all along-the miracle cure , is just stop re-damaging ourselves and just get out of the way and let our bodies natural healing process bring us back towards health . there is only one diet that 's ever been proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients , a plant-based diet . anytime anyone tries to sell you on some new diet , ask them one simple question : “ has it been proven to reverse heart disease ( yaknow , the most likely reason you and everyone you love will die ? ) ” if not , why would you even consider it ? if that 's all a plant-based diet could do-reverse our # 1 killer , then shouldn 't that be the default diet until proven otherwise ? and the fact that it can also be effective in preventing , treating , and arresting other leading killers , such as diabetes and high blood pressure would seem to make the case for plant-based eating overwhelming . so why don 't doctors prescribe it ? available time is a reason frequently cited by physicians , but if you probe a little deeper ... yes they complain about not having enough time to give their patients dietary advice ... but the number one reason , was their perception that patients fear being deprived of all the junk they 're eating . can you imagine a doctor saying , yeah i 'd like to tell my patients to stop smoking , but i know how much they love it . dr. neal barnard wrote a compelling editorial , in the american medical association 's journal of ethics . when he stopped smoking in the 80 's , the lung cancer death rate was peaking in the u.s. , but has since dropped , with dropping smoking rates . no longer were doctors telling patients to give their throat a vacation , by smoking a fresh cigarette . doctors realized they were more effective at counseling patients to quit smoking if they no longer had tobacco stains on their own fingers . in other words , doctors went from being bystanders-or even enablers-to leading the fight against smoking . and today , he says , plant-based diets , are the nutritional equivalent , of quitting smoking . this is not , vegetarianism . vegetarians often consume all sorts of junk . vegans too , for that matter . this new paradigm is exclusively plant-based nutrition . whole plant foods . why exclusively ? well , as reported in the cornell-oxford-china study , there does not appear to be a threshold beyond which further benefits did not accrue with increasing proportions of plant foods in the diet . it appears the more plant-based foods and the fewer animal-based foods , the better . it took five decades after the initial studies linking tobacco and cancer for effective public health policies to be put into place , with enormous cost to human health . must we wait another 50 years to respond to the epidemics of dietary disease ? they do have money on their side . the chemical , tobacco and food industries have the luxury to share similar tactics with the drug companies , because they have the resources to do so . by contrast , powerful and cheap health promoting activities ( like eating healthy ) are too cheap , can 't be patented , aren 't profitable . and they throw that money around . the american dietetic association , for example , promotes a series of nutrition fact sheets . who writes them ? industry sources pay $ 20,000 per fact sheet to the ada and explicitly take part in writing the documents . so you can learn about eggs from the egg industry , the benefits of chewing gum from the wrigley science institute . i didn 't know wrigley 's had a science institute . in 2008 , the ada announced that the coca-cola company had become an official partner to give them prominent access to key influencers and decision makers and share the coca-cola company 's research findings . for example : did you know there are no harmful effects of different coca-cola beverages on rat testicles ? was that even a concern ? thou doth protest too much , methinks . when the american academy of family physicians was called out on their proud new corporate relationship with coke to support patient education on healthy eating , an executive vice-president of the academy tried to quell protest by explaining that this alliance was not without precedent . they had relationships with pepsi and mcdonald 's for some time . reminiscent , of similar types of relationships ... in the past ... this didn 't seem placate the critics , so the exec assured them that the american dietetic association has made a policy statement that “ there are no good or bad foods . ” a position that the food industry has then exploited . in its early years , the tobacco industry sounded a similar theme : smoking per se was not bad , only “ excess ” smoking . sound familiar ? everything , in moderation . is this what family docs and dieticians have been reduced to ? to justify unholy financial alliances they deny that there are actually unhealthy foods . thankfully there is a corporate sector that actually benefits from keeping people healthy , the insurance industry . last year a nutritional update for physicians was published in the official journal of kaiser permanente , the largest managed care organization in the country , covering about 9 million people with about 15,000 physicians-who were told , that healthy eating may be best achieved with a plant-based diet , defined as a regimen that encourages whole , plant-based foods and discourages meats , dairy , and eggs as well as all refined and processed junk . too often , physicians ignore the potential benefits of good nutrition and quickly prescribe medications instead of giving patients a chance to correct their disease through healthy eating and active living . physicians should therefore consider recommending a plant-based diet to all their patients , especially those with high blood pressure , diabetes , cardiovascular disease , or obesity . the major downside is that it may work a little too well . if people are on medications their blood pressure or blood sugar could actually drop too low , so physicians may need to adjust medications or eliminate them altogether . the side-effects , ironically , may be : not-having-to-take-drugs . despite the strong body of evidence favoring plant-based diets , many physicians are not stressing the importance of plant- based diets as a first-line treatment for chronic illnesses . ( that 's an understatement ) this could be because of a lack of physician awareness-or , a lack of patient education resources . so kaiser sought to change that . excellent summary of the past few months – the doc ’ s non-patronising delivery and sense of humor are at their best – don ’ t ever stop dr gif you liked this one , please don ’ t miss one his best of all time … entertaining / as he often is / as he even amuses himself at times / and massively informative , this is “ the missing link ” / how to translate all this in to daily reality : https : / / www.google.com / url ?

in addition , i was raised in the christian science faith , my grandmother a “ practitioner / healer ” , again setting me up as “ different ” . one of the founding principles of the christian science faith , based on the experiences of the founder , mary baker eddy , around 1890 , was that in fact , more often than not , the body does have the god given ability to heal itself , being allowed to do so . i am so very thankful that i was so blessed and at 60 , have never felt better nor been in better condition / looking forward to and working on becoming 100 or so in good health . one of my relatives lived well to the age of 108 ! ! ! are you vegetarian / vegan ? vegan , 95 % of the time , for health , ethical and environmental reasons . at 60 , and as always , health is a big one . why not be as healthy as i can be while helping to ensure the health of the earth for my children and generations yet to come . to me , our anatomy dictates our predisposition . while i believe we are each an experiment of one , i can for sure say that i have never felt better , run stronger , nor required less sleep or recovery time . enjoyed a solid 6.5 mile run at swift pace this am . greatly enjoyed a nine mile trail run on saturday am , with hills , full out . here is to your best health yet.first time on this site . i find this post very interesting . carry on , david , you ’ re obviously doing things right . i ’ ve reached my 80th year with no regular aches and pains . i ’ ve had ‘ flu only once as an adult , and no colds for over 10 years . i became a wholefood vegetarian at age 17 , having come from an orthodox medical family for two generations , who regarded me as the ‘ ; black sheep ’ of the family . i went to one public meeting about christian science in my teens , but found that they seemed to exclusively deal with the ‘ mind ’ and did not seem to follow any sound health or nutrition ideas , unless you can tell me differently . my relatives die early , and i decided to aim for 100 a couple of years back ! i have gotten so burnt out with the daily practice of medicine that i have been losing my passion for spreading the healthy food message.now don ’ t get me wrong i eat healthy as all can be and i do have a few patients that change , but the patient ’ s i mostly work with are the , drug addicts , uneducated ( some i treat cannot read or write – really ! ) and the “ slaves to their tongue ” ( pleasure trap ) population ( eg . morbidly obese , diabetics , polyarthralgia , chronic pain ) – a constantly uphill battle ! your presentation reignited the flame within ! namaste.dear beleaguered , dr. hemo , have you thought that it may be time to modify your practice ? feelings of burn out are symptoms , not to be ignored . how much of a beating can one take and still thrive ? many dedicated docs take too much punishment . many practices are too specialized for the doctor ’ s heath . could you decrease the number of patients who are caught in the pleasure trap and increase , start a new practice , or ? … and treat those who are eager and willing to do their part ? new , young , docs still want work with the addicts etc . you don ’ t owe them all of your professional practice . good luck to you.it ’ s good to hear a doctor who tries to educate patients . do you use simple strategies , like 5-a-day etc. and give simple leaflets or booklets ? obviously patients will need to read ! others may be interested in a group meeting , when you promote health . surely a few will be interested . good luckamazing presentation ! ! ! ! loved it ! thank you so much for posting . i can ’ t wait to share this with friends & family . please keep doing what you do.you are the backbone of our efforts to lead a healthy long life ! thanks for being who you are and the tremendous amount of hard work.you are my hero – thank you , thank you , thank you . do you have thoughts about microwaving – so many of those urban phobias have turned out to be true.joy miller : the following page is extremely helpful in understanding microwaves and dispelling myths. http : / / www.drmyattswellnessclub.com / microwave.htmalso note that nutrtionfacts has at least one video that mentions microwaves in a positive light. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / best-cooking-method / just avoid the butter-flavored microwave popcorn http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ?

hasn ’ t anyone else been able to replicate their studies ? probably because other researchers are not interested . there always have been just a small number of such dedicated doctors.grazie mille ! ! ! carol , e italiano ? parla italiano ? potresti tradurre alcune video in italiano ? ho degli amici che hanno bisogno di capirli.how did dr. g learn to become such a good public speaker ? experience.no clogged arteries feeding his braini came across a video recently detailing some of the sacrifices dr. greger has made in spreading the message and the repercussions . his zeal , and it is interesting to see his more primitive / recorded / graphics from a decade ago , motivated him to travel rather extensively and as i recall , cost him his marriage as well . a true servant of the people , all the money for speaking / books / et.al. goes to the not-for-profit that helps to continue bringing you this information . there are many volunteers and i am hoping even more can be brought to bear the pleasure of contributing to the spread of this so very needed information – “ the dr. greger army ” / so to speak . you can check out his speaking schedule on his website : veganmd.org , http : / / www.drgreger.org / speaking-dates if you find this information as interesting and as helpful as i do – check it 7 : 00 am chicago time every week day ! ! ! ! / please make a financial contribution in any amount that you may wish to do so . the purchase of any of his dvds also helps the cause / and he often has a deal to buy a package of them he has recorded over the years . they make great presents for students / schools / and those you care most about.to your improved / better / best health yet ! ! ! ! note above / he has a new book coming out . i have been mentioning that / and hoping for that / to be able to more fully assimilate this information . hearing it is one thing / seeing it another / and being able to have it in reference form would be another dimension / component of learning / growing et.al.note the transcripts of most of these presentations / and the references are noted as well for those who want to delve deeper.as chef aj mentioned / in regards to the great book whole , what you mostly need was summarized / contained on “ page 7 ″ ; easy to describe / and dr. greger has a summary of the ideal diet i am trying to track down . not so easy in execution / but / more so if one focuses in on the essence of a whole foods / plant based diet . food as food . food has no labels per se.fantastic work as always dr. greger ! i ’ m almost completely vegan now and i can ’ t thank you enough for pointing me in the right direction ! however , if people on a wfpbd are far less likely to die from all the major causes of death , what do you expect these people will die from ? do you expect people on a wfpbd to live much longer ? whether longer or not , they will surely be healthier to whatever age they reach.liam314 : congratulations on your progress to healthy eating ! ! ! you raise two questions which come up often . dr. greger is in the process of writing a book about living longer . in the mean time , check out the information i included below about two studies on this very topic.the other topic is different . no one is saying that at wfpbd is going to make someone live forever . so , what do people on a wfpbd die of ? it is a legitimate question . i heard dr. mcdougal answer it once , but i can ’ t remember what video it was in . i ’ ll paraphrase and hopefully get it right : you don ’ t actually have to die of a disease . there really is such a thing as dieing of old age . we are such a sick society , we don ’ t really see much of that any more . but it is a “ thing ” . dieing of old age involves losing consciousness , and then your systems shutting down one at a time . according to dr. mcdougall , this is a very peaceful and natural way to die . if no disease is involved and someone is at the end of a long healthy life who dies in the way i just described , then that is dieing of old age . sign me up . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * from pcrm breaking news : “ vegetarians live longer vegetarian diets can extend life expectancy , according to early findings from the adventist health study-2 . vegetarian men live to an average of 83.3 years , compared with nonvegetarian men who live to an average of 73.8 years . and vegetarian women live to an average of 85.7 years , which is 6.1 years longer than nonvegetarian women . this study is ongoing and includes more than 96,000 participants . the results further indicate vegan diets to be healthful and associated with a lower body weight ( on average 30 lbs. lower than that of meat eaters ) , and lower risk of diabetes , compared with diets that include animal products . ” fraser g , haddad e. hot topic : vegetarianism , mortality and metabolic risk : the new adventist health study . report presented at : academy of nutrition and dietetic ( food and nutrition conference ) annual meeting ; october 7 , 2012 : philadelphia , pa . — — from meetout monday : living veg adds 10 yearsloma linda university school of public health released a study based on the eating habits of 73,000 americans . the results are in — those who follow a meat-free diet have a decreased mortality rate by a staggering 20 percent ! “ based on this study and other recent research , on average , vegetarians and semi-vegetarians tend to add about 10 years to their lives , ” said sam soret , co-author of the study.it ’ s so cool knowing that it ’ s possible make food choices that not only help animals , but that also are good for our health and wellness too ! read more about the study at : http : / / vegnews.com / articles / page.do ?

is the decline simply due to economic factors or are people starting to get the message ? hopefully the latter.while we may be seeing the sprouts of a cultural shift to whole plant based diets , i suspect lower disposable income and higher meat costs ( due in part to the corn ethanol mandate ) are largely responsible . see “ retail meat prices , usda ” in this industry report.i don ’ t think people ate less meat because of the economy – did they smoke less cigarettes ? probably did with less “ fresh ” meat and opted for more processed varieties.would you mind sharing the source for your info on industry paying the ada $ 20,000 per ada factsheet ?

what is the hierarchy of best sources and what are usual serving sizes ? we found huhs.harvard.edu / assets / file / ourservices / service _ nutrition _ fiber.pdf. it is pretty good , but a video from dr. greger would be much more fun and more inspiring ! if any of the team experts have suggestions , we would appreciate them . we know dr. greger has already done his part and has much more good work to do ! we are so very grateful to you all who contribute to this site . thank you all ! dr. kellogg would be proud of you dr. greger . my mother who recently passed at 105 was a student of dr. kellogg . she would be proud of you too . jon rosenbaum son of beatrice rosenbaum rnthanks dr. greger — amazing presentation . one day when a plant-based doctors ’ hall of fame is created , your portrait will be proudly hanging there.i always hear that we should eat whole plant based foods . how comes that people in thailand ( for example ) eat loads of white rice ( refined rice ) and they are all slim ? how comes ? the standard size trousers are 28 . i hardly found stuff for me as i have a 34 waist.what ’ s the leading causing death in thailand ? heart disease as they eat so much refined rice ? seems you answered your own question . plant food stripped of the fiber and many phytonutrients will not likely cause obesity by itself since there is still , from your description , not a huge caloric surplus . plants stripped of phytonutrients and fiber will also not protect against heart disease . and indeed there is a move to ever more animal foods in all parts of the world if they can get it . so with even small increases in animal products and with the plant nutrition reduced , it seems only logical that the diseases of affluence would be beginning to take hold.there is a line from the persian book of kings which we roughly translate as “ knowledge is power . ” when i first came to this web site citing mostly peer reviewed primary research sources , i felt empowered.i have been with the same doctor for 20 years or more and she does have some respect for me as i diagnosed and cured my own psoriatic arthritis with a plant based diet and at age 64 with type i diabetes i am the best controlled diabetic patient , type i or ii , she has ever cared for . she deals with diabetic side effects routinely . this segment on diabetic neuropathy is more powerful than any of the daily videos . i would like to get her the whole dvd with citations . with a science oriented person , as mds may be , the citations may lend credibility . so i want to download this to burn and present to my doctor and others . i also would like to get a comprehensive list of the sources cited to go with it . any chance of that happening ? stewart : i don ’ t think the exact feature you are looking for is available as-is . however , if you were willing to do some work , you could get close.to start , you would purchase a dvd of this talk . unfortunately , that doesn ’ t come with all of the citations . however , all of the information covered in the summary talk , is also covered in individual daily videos either already or coming up in the next few months or so . and as you ( hopefully ) know , the daily videos * do * include citations . so , you could put together the citations over time , even connected with the daily video transcripts for categorizing and further helping to assimilate the information.that ’ s all i can think of if you are very interested in spoon feeding the information to people . another approach would be to give your doctor a link to this free video right here along with links to the daily videos that back up this summary video . then if your doctor was intrigued she might take the time to look up the citations . that ’ s just another way to approach the situation.hope you can find something that will work for you.why can ’ t we watch past 28.04 minutes ? we ’ d like to see the remainder … who is better than dr greger for the position of united states assistant secretary for healthyes yes yes ! this was incredible . i ’ ve watched it twice now . thank you , dr. greger ! he is awesome ! ! ! i ’ ve been thinking about cutting meat out of my diet and now i have more info on why i should … .. ; - ) if this video doesnt convince people to eat mostly plantbased , then probably nothing will … .. amazing talk ! this should be essential viewing for everyone … it was amazing to me that young kids are now having back problems and that atherosclerosis could cause back problems … .and so a plant-based diet could lead to a healthier back ! who but dr. g would have pointed this out ? and also interesting that constipation and breast cancer may be linked . ( scary , too , since i ’ m not part of the 3 a day a club — a super pooper as the good doctor calls it , even though i eat a whole-foods plant-based diet . ) dr. g never seems to give up hope that people will see the light . i am more cynical about it since i ’ ve not seen many people make the switch from sad.inspiring , much needed stuff here michael . thank you for your work . such a noble cause that could change the world if enough of us jump up and help spread the message . keep going.wonderful presentation once again , but you keep getting better ! you manage to present a lot of information and insights , while keeping people completely engaged and having a heck of a good time . : ) and as always learning a lot . thank you.we keep owing you.2 years since i went plant based . 10kg lost , breathing better , sport better , focused and generally feeling happy . i live in france and eating large quantities of meat and dairy is quite normal here . in fact , the amount of obese people here is on the rise . the national health care budget in france is just enormous. heart disease , cancer … so don ’ t believe the hype about the mediterranean diet.and last time i checked , greece has the highest obesity rate in europe or at least among the mediterranean countries.gary : it is so interesting when people from other countries give us peaks into the situation where they live . thanks for your post . ( and congrats on your 2 years of healthy eating . that ’ s great . ) when it comes to soluble and insoluble fiber , it is difficult to approach 25 g / day without supplementation . furthermore getting information on the numbers is difficult on the web.hi cyndishisara , are you eating a whole foods plant based diet ? i average around 70 g total fiber per day , or about 20-25 g per meal , with no supplementation . just fruits , vegetables , and lots of whole grains and legumes . a typical meal might be lentil or chickpea stew with rice or whole grain bread and steamed broccoli.the only way to get less would be if i consumed more refined flours / sugars , oils , or more of the higher fat whole plant foods e.g. peanut butter.you can easily find total fiber values using the usda database : http : / / ndb.nal.usda.gov / also cronometer.com is helpful for both searching for values and entering them in a journal format so you can track your intake.i specifically said soluble fiber ! of course eating whole foods as i do without any extracted oils you get plenty of insoluble fiber . the web site that you referred me to does not distinguish between all forms of fiber . my diet is basically whole grains ( hulled barley , oat groats , whole rye seed , soft wheat berries ) , beans ( pinto , black and adzuki ) . kale and the other vegetables , white sesame seed , flax meal , sweet potatoes , mushrooms , apples , prunes , dates , white tea , coffee , pears , oranges and avocadoes processed by me either raw , pressure cooked or boiled . insoluble fiber does not make up for soluble fiber . i do not supplement with inulin or psyllium . i am looking for real information.hi cyndishisara , reading “ when it comes to soluble and insoluble fiber ” , made it seem as though you were interested in both.some real information , per your request , via google : http : / / www.globalrph.com / fiber _ content _ soluble.htmhttp : / / huhs.harvard.edu / assets / file / ourservices / service _ nutrition _ fiber.pdfhttps : / / www.prebiotin.com / resources / fiber-content-of-foods / http : / / www.dietitians.ca / getattachment / 3bb6330f-0ab2-48fc-9d24-1303ad70003d / factsheet-food-sources-of-soluble-fibre.pdf.aspxhttp : / / ocw.tufts.edu / data / 47 / 531408.pdfcan i ask how many calories you are eating per day ? i threw a typical day ’ s intake into the calculator ( a few fruits , oatmeal , 2 pieces bread , rice , 2 cups beans , steamed broccoli , and a salad ’ s worth of vegetables ) and it gave me a result of 24.95 g soluble fiber.i eat 4.5 cups ( 1.5 cups dry ) of beans black or pinto and 3 cups ( 1 cup dry oat , barley , rye , wheat or combo ) of grain . i know this because i cook this every day or so in my pressure cooker . i also eat about 5 prunes and 2 dates , 2 apples or pears . generally i eat enough to maintain my weight of 122 pounds at 5 ′ 7.5 ″ . so i try to eat as much as i can and as off as i can ! i find these sites to be very annoying including probiotin which i already new about ! i did learn an interesting point pears contain approximately twice the soluble fiber as apples . i just have trouble trusting all the numbers . i am looking for a workable chart not really for myself but to help others . i just see all these as inadequate . i want something just from tried measurements , basic and inclusive ! words like bread are not scientific ! just want to thank you for the response . i now understand how i get my calories and all forms of of fiber , if i can get the 1.5 cups of beans and 1 cup of hulled barley ( all raw ) with fruits and vegetables and flax meal a sprinkle of sesame and a long mile walk it fits to together for a 122 pound 5 ′ 7 ″ person . i normally do not count calories but the big picture helps.i just used your calculator boomer and got 22g soluble fiber . i think on this wfpb plan none of us has to worry about getting enough . thanks for the links ! i just see a pattern the amount of soluble fiber in food is much lower than insoluble . prunes are my best source of soluble fiber.sorry if i was not clear ! i get a load of fiber ! i know over 70 grams total . however in studying the subject i notice that it is hard to get enough soluble fiber and to get reliable information on just how much their is in food constituents . i want to be more versatile than consuming psyllium or inulin ( sun chokes or chicory ) . i do know that dried prunes are a good source also.i sometimes get 80 grams of fiber a day , never less than 50.soluble fiber without supplementation ? i believe i do get 25 grams however it is not as easy as it seems.it is not that hard if you add a bit of fos to your yogurt or smoothies ( adds a nice sweetness , but use no more than 5-10 g per serving or you better stay close to a toilet ; - ) and make a point to eat foods particularly high in soluble fiber ( like oat bran and flax seed ) .yes i am aware of inulin ( fos ) is powerful ! tubers as sunchokes are especially high in inulin ( fos ) only if picked early ( not fully ripened ) . inulin or fos is a powerful soluble fiber.another excellent installment for us to share around and spread the word . : ) relax & enjoy – eat & drink plants to overcome degenerative disease and recover health.this may be hard for some to believe . today i had a doctors appointment . i found my physician standing at an elevated desk rather than sitting . he stated he had been doing desk work that way for a while due to chronic back pain.i mentioned to him what i had just recently learned in michael ’ s video.honest to god , his reply was that even if his arteries were partially clogged it was still akin to a freeway which was 50 % jammed . that still meant that 50 % was moving blood through his body.kinda scary to me … .wow. scary to me too.awesome presentation as always . you are among the most eloquent and convincing of voices for the plant based diet . your website and lectures have been invaluable to me in changing my diet . thank you so much ! hey can anyone suggest some help for chronic pain ? ive been eating a plant-based diet for a couple years but am tying to go vegan now and really ramp it up . i have chronic pain in my arms and shoulders everyday . any ideas as far as natural foods for a remedy ? i ’ m a big believer in anti-inflammatory herbs and spices . i sprinkle ceylon cinnamon on my baked potato . turmeric is a good one . i think dr. greger has a video of anti-inflammatory foods . i got rid of osteoarthritis in hand and shoulder when i went vegan and also cut all added sugars , baked goods , processed foods , and all oils.thank you for adding the subtitles ! i can now capture images , complete with your words when i view the video on my ipad or iphone . this is very useful when sharing specific food facts with others.i ’ m so glad you shared the permanente journal article ( nutrition update for physicians ) . a few months ago , i recorded a short video , where i simply read the highlights of this important article : http : / / youtu.be / acwb8mccjfuyou ’ re so freaking fabulous ! ! your delivery is incredible . thank you for what you do.once again doc ! outta the park ! i am going to send this to everyone i know ! i love your lectures and the special style you give to it . i love you doctor ! ! : dthank you so much , dr greger ! you are my hero ! my commentary would be – yes – cook your own food from scratch and eat natural fruits and veggies as much as you can afford-and canned and frozen are good too – as long as you don ’ t see a great list of added ingredients . my main no-no -and it should be for everybody -is to read labels and shun anything that contains partially -hydrogenated oils or fats -of any sort . the process of adding the hydrogen extends the shelf life but shortens yours . it does not break down as it should in your body but accumulates as plaque in the arteries . i should know . i had a heart attack a few months ago -with 90 % blockage . i used to use a lot of margarine – straight and in cooking – no more for me thank you . i go easy on the butter but never use the margarine or cooking shortening. any more . there are plenty of healthful oils – just use them in moderation you can even make a quick and easy piecrust with oils -that is flaky and tender.no more partially -hydrogenated anything for me – and if we all demanded that they stop doing it by boycotting those products – they wouldn ’ t be able to sell them-so they would have to stop doing it . .crowlady : i highly recommend you read the book : prevent and reverse heart disease by caldwell esselstyn . esselstyn was able to take patients who had many heart attacks and were given up by their doctors and reverse their disease to the point that all the people who stuck with the diet had no more events.it ’ s going to take a few more changes for you , but you seem like the kind of person who values her health enough to make the effort. http : / / www.amazon.com / prevent-reverse-heart-disease-nutrition-based / dp / 1583333002 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 ?

dr. greger your straightforward remarks is truly informative and it will always be appreciated by anyone seeking the truth about the typical american diet . i have greatly benefited for your research and remarks , please accept my appreciation for your efforts to open the eye ’ s of those looking for the truth about our lifestyle and diet in america.hey ya all , i need some help . i ’ m doing a capstone on plant-based nutrition . i need 15 research studies , none older than 5 years . 2009 . i have them , sorta , but i would like better studies and some of them randomized . need help finding the best ones.even a list of the articles used in this report ? riley : the information in this talk is repeated in the topic-focused video-of-the-day pages . you can find the studies referenced in this talk by going to the relevant videos-of-the-day and then clicking the “ sources cited ” link.just a correction for accuracy- according to a new study the active surface area of the intestinal tract is smaller than traditionally thought – more like 30 square meters not 300 sq m. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 24694282they ’ re not taking into account the additional surface area of all the microvillus http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / microvillus . it adds tons.i have ms and am on a vegan diet . i really believe it helps me . however , my family doctor told me i needed to eat “ a lot ” of fat for my brain to work . what is that all about ? how much fat does a person need or does it depend on the person ? carol : i ’ m not a doctor , but my understanding of the science is that humans probably need about 6 % of your calories from fat . i get that number from the traditional okinawans who are some of the longest and healthiest people around . so , while you may be able to get away with eating more than 6 % fat and still be healthy , you probably don ’ t * need * more than that.and that 6 % will feel like a very little amount . from the anecdotes and papers from experts like say mcdouggall that i have read , most people eating a pretty clean whole foods plant based diet in america , including consuming some nuts and seeds , seem to get around 10 to 15 % of calories from fat in their diet . and this is with no oils and minimal nuts and seeds.bottom line : i ’ m not a doctor , but i think your doctor is very confused.i ’ m sorry to hear about your ms. i hope you are able to stop progression . if you haven ’ t seen them already , check out the videos on this site regarding ms.your brain runs on glycogen , not fat . your doctor is a total idiot if he thinks the brain runs on fats.thank you thea . i appreciate your response to the amount of fat needed . i am a great fan of this site and have had no relapses in the three years i have been diagnosed with ms. my problem is high cholesterol so rather than my doctor ’ s advice , i have been examining my diet to cut fats and sugars.how does one come to work for you ? ! i am studying to get certified in holistic nutrition consulting . the program i am working through has given all of your videos and i am so grateful for your research ! it definitely comes in handy when someone approaches me about why i believe what i do . the main point i get from all of your videos is this : go vegan ! i am a huge fan of dr gregor and have been for some time . his style is engaging , but the facts he is able to turn up are simply astonishing . dr. gregor should be appointed as the surgeon general in the us . of course that could never happen because the meat , egg and dairy industries would never allow it . i guess it ’ s up to the rest of us to simply get the word out about the wisdom of the advice he offers . keep doing your work dr gregor , here ’ s wishing you many years of continued health – but being vegan , i ’ m confident that is almost guaranteed : - ) the mike is positioned too low for the speaker . every time he throws his head back you lose the sound.thank you for all you do to keep us informed ! ! i have been trying to find updated information in regards to flax and dha supplements . i eat 2 tbsp of ground flax seed a day . is that enough ? should we be eating more than 2 tbsp or should we also be supplementing with dha even if we are taking flax daily ? thank you ! teenateena : to the best of my knowledge , dr. greger recommends about 2 tablespoons ground flaxseed per day per person . there ’ s no need for more than that.supplementing with dha is a bit controversial . based on my research , i think someone eating a perfect or near-perfect diet would not need to supplement with dha . however , i don ’ t know about you , but i don ’ t come anywhere near to eating the type of diet i would need to eat to say think i don ’ t need the supplement . my opinion is that supplementing with an algae-based dha ( and also epa ? ) product might be a very good idea as insurance depending on the type of diet a person eats.here are dr. greger ’ s nutrition recommendations . you can see that he does indeed recommend a dha supplement : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / # comment-1793210632amazing video ! thank you so much for the work you put into videos and research . the facts are put together in such a way that the average person can understand them . awesome ! lmfao . excellent talk and insightful.what can be done for someone who has dementia and is in the hospital for a blockage in the small intestine ?

PLAIN-2449	how to make your own fruit and vegetable wash how might we reduce our exposure to pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables ? what about staying away from imported produce ? turns out domestic produce may be even worse , dispelling this notion that imported fruits and vegetables pose greater potential health risks to consumers.buying organic dramatically reduces dietary exposure to pesticides , but does not eliminate the potential risk . pesticide residues are detectable in about 1 in 10 organic crop samples , due to cross-contamination from neighboring fields , the continued presence of very persistent pesticides like ddt in the soil , or accidental or fraudulent use.by choosing organic , one hopes to shift exposures from a range of uncertain risk to more of a range of negligible risk , but even if all we had to eat were the most pesticide laden of conventional produce , there is a clear consensus in the scientific community that the health benefits from consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh any potential risks from pesticide residues , but we can easily reduce whatever risk there is by rinsing our fruits and vegetables under running water.there are , however , a plethora of products alleged by advertisers to reduce fruit and produce pesticide residues more effectively than water and touted to concerned consumers . for example procter & gamble introduced a fruit and vegetable wash in the year 2000 . as part of the introduction , t.g.i. friday 's jumped on board bragging on their menus that the cheese and bacon puddles they call potato skins were first washed with the new product , after all it was proclaimed proven to be 98 % more effective than water in removing pesticides . so researchers put it to the test and it did no better than plain tap water . shortly thereafter , procter & gamble discontinued the product , but numerous others took its place claiming their vegetable washes are three , four , five or even ten times more effective than water , to which the researcher replied , “ that 's mathematically impossible ” . if water removes like 50 % , you can 't take off 10 times more than 50 % . they actually found water removed up to 80 % of pesticide residues , like the fungicide captan for example , so for other brands of veggie washes to brag 3 , 4 , 5 , 10 times better than water is mathematically impossible indeed.other fruit and vegetable washes have since been put to the test . they compared fit to fruit & vegetable wash , to two i ’ ve never heard of , organiclean , and vegi-clean , compared to using dishwashing soap , all compared to just rinsing in plain tap water . 196 samples of lettuce , strawberries , and tomatoes were tested , and they found little or no difference between just rinsing with tap water compared to any of the veggie washes , or the dishsoap . they all just seemed like a waste of money . the researchers concluded that just the mechanical action of rubbing the produce under tap water seemed to do it and that using detergents or fruit and vegetable washes do not enhance the removal of pesticide residues from produce above that of just rinsing with tap water alone.that may not be saying much though , captan appears to be the exception . when rinsing with plain water was tried against a half dozen other pesticides , less than half the residues were removed . fingernail polish works better , but the goal is to end up with a less toxic , not a more toxic tomato . we need a straightforward , plausible , and safe method for enhanced pesticide removal , although the efficacy of pesticide removal from fruits and vegetables has been rarely reported in the medical literature . anything we can add to the water to boost its pesticide stripping abilities ? if you soak potatoes in water , between about 2 to 13 % of the pesticides are removed , but a 5 % acetic acid solution removes up to 100 % . what ’ s that ? plain white vinegar . but 5 % is full strength . what about diluted vinegar ? diluted vinegar only seemed marginally better than tap water for removing pesticide residues . using full strength vinegar would get expensive , though . thankfully there ’ s something cheaper that works even better . salt water . a 10 % salt solution appears to work as good or better than full-strength vinegar . to make a 10 % salt solution you just have to mix up about 1 part salt to 9 parts water , though make sure to rinse all of the salt off before eating.there ’ s not much you can do for the pesticides in animal products , though . the top sources of some pesticides are fruits and vegetables ; but for others , it ’ s dairy , eggs , and meat , because the chemicals build up in fat . so what do you do about pesticides in meat , egg yolks , or egg whites ? hard boiling appears to destroy more pesticides that scrambling , but for the pesticides that build up in the fat in fish or chicken , cooking can sometimes increase pesticide levels that you can ’ t just wash off . in fact washing meat , poultry , or eggs is considered one of the top ten dangerous food safety mistakes . thank you ! any thoughts on antibiotics triggering long-term gi issues or neurological problems ? i trust plant-baed doctors and it sure isn ’ t easy to find them . thank you for any ideas or comments . i have sibo and yeast issues , according to doctor , but i ’ m not thrilled about ingesting antibiotics.i had to look up what sibo is , my sympathies go out to you . i am not a medical person but i do know that antibiotics cause yeast infections . antibiotics kill the good bugs as well as the bad ones in our gut . one way to fight against yeast infections is to eat fermented vegetables and fruits such as home made sauerkraut to provide probiotics which will help the gut to fight an overgrowth of yeast infections.thanks for the interesting , practical information on washing veggies ! i ’ ve heard of washing with vinegar , but a salt wash is new to me . how long do we need to soak the produce in salt water ? 5 minutes ? for those of us who like to move quickly in the kitchen , would it be almost as effective to just scrub moistened ( non-leafy ) produce with salt , then rinse ? hey julie . it looks like researchers soaked for 20 minutes . other studies varied , from 5 minutes to 10 minutes . hmmm , i ’ m not sure about scrubbing with salt and if it ’ d have the same effect i would expect soaking is best . if i find out otherwise i ’ ll let you know , or perhaps others have an idea ? i second this query , if you wouldn ’ t mind bringing us dr. greger ’ s thoughts.in the paper with the salt water wash and others , the produce was soaked in the “ bath ” for 20 minutes . what would that translate to if the fruit or greens or whatever were rubbed with hands etc ? the concentration was mentioned in this video , but not how long to spend washing to be effective . i suppose that with greens , it ’ s only practical to soak or stir , but i would like to know what dr. greger thinks would be sufficient if rubbing were incorporated . especially since a lot of produce doesn ’ t sink enough to self-submerge in a soak anyway . thank you.you are asking the right questions . like i told scott above we simply don ’ t know anymore than what ’ s in the video . anywhere from 5-20 minutes was found to be effective.i too really want to know this . the video didn ’ t actually answer its own question : how do we make a vegetable wash ? it ’ s important to know if we scrub or soak or what.i think you ’ re right , scott . the problem is we don ’ t know anymore than anyone who watched the video . the soaking times varied in these studies ( 5-20minutes ) and they used different concentrations of salt solutions . i didn ’ t hear anything about scrubbing . from what i gather , soaking for about 5 minutes or so in a salt bath ( ratio of 1 : 10 salt : water ) and then rinsing to remove the salt could be useful.thank you for the update ! i am glad you all are willing to admit when we don ’ t know something . i think it is better to say we don ’ t know than to make wild guesses.did all of the studies with salt solutions show some sort of improvement ? so could we say , “ 5-20 minutes of soaking is effective ” ? [ edit : and then i read your above comment . d ’ oh ! ok , question answered : ) ] maybe this is a study we could fund for nutritionfacts.org ? “ how best to wash vegetables . ” not glorious , but very practical.dr. gonzales , please forgive my ignorance , but i just want to make sure i am adding the right amount . the ratio of 1 : 10 salt : water means 1 cup of salt for 10 cups of water or 1 tbs of salt for 10 tbs of water ? thank you.hi , kelly . yes , that is what i take from it , but when you say “ a cup of salt ” i cringe a bit ! obviously you are not ingesting it . just be sure to soak in the 1 : 10 ratio and then rinse-off well.what about other things that we want to wash off of our organic produce besides pesticides ? will a 10 % salt solution kill germs effectively ? sure , salt can kill some bacteria , but how effectively i am not sure ? water seems to be the best possible way to reduce pathogens . interesting this study compared washing fruit with water vs. three different commonly used sanitizers and found no difference in antimicrobial activity .. very interesting & helpful . it leaves me wondering whether spraying produce with white vinegar ( full-strength ) and wiping it off would be as effective as soaking . soaking in salt water raises a number of questions for me , including : how long a soak is necessary ? how many times can you reuse the solution before it becomes too toxin-laden to be effective ? ( salt is cheap but i ’ m frugal . ) how much salt absorbed by the produce is not rinsed off in a freshwater bath ? ( an important issue for people trying to limit sodium intake . ) interesting to note that one of the sources cited above notes that “ radish solution ” was 100 % effective in eliminating organochlorine pesticides , followed in efficacy by citric & ascorbic acid solutions . a different paper notes that stir-frying cabbage for 5 minutes was more effective in reducing pesticides than soaking in any of the solutions tested , including salt and vinegar.great points ! let ’ s see if i can help . washing times vary per study . the salt solutions soaked produce for 20 minutes . i doubt they reused the water . i would think more porous fruits and veggies ( perhaps berries ) could absorb some salt , so washing it off after is a good thing . i think i just gaged though at the thought of salty berries . anyway , produce with thick skins may not absorb salt as much . at least pesticides are not as common in fruit and veggies with thicker skins.i wonder if it was the high temperature during the stir-frying that destroyed or evaporated the pesticides.i just soaked a pint of strawberries in 2 1 / 2 cups of water with 1 / 4 cup of salt for a little over 20 minutes . after soaking i rinsed thoroughly with fresh water . my husband commented , “ gee , these strawberries taste really salty ” .strawberries absorb water freely . might need an alternative option to soaking.are antibiotics safe to take for sibo – – – small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as well as some sort of yeast overgrowth in intestines + gut . ? my doctor wants me to go on rifaximin / xifaxin or similar antibiotic for a couple weeks . my biggest fear is that this and these antiiotics could trigger something worse . i have read that sometimes taking a course of antibiotics – just one round – can change someone ’ s life for the worse longterm . also have read that rifaximin and other antibiotics can predispose someone to coming down with clostridium difficile – i am plant-based and very low fat diet , no dairy and no eggs and no meat . every once in a while fish . that is it . no sugar or sweeteners , – i have tried all the sibo diets , no real success . i do eat lots of fresh fruit.maybe someone hear has experience with safety of antibiotics for sibo , safety of antibiotics in general.visit herbdoc.com. dr . schultz save a lot of people with sibo with his detox systems . you would not needed antibiotics at all.hello ! great question . yes , the antibiotic rifaximin can reduce the numbers of “ bad ” bacteria in the small bowel bacteria , thereby creating an environment where the “ good ” bacteria get a chance to multiply . however , as you mentioned , rifaximin can also create a more friendly environment for the clostridium difficile bacteria , which may cause loose stools , dehdration , and even death . a better solution might be to follow the whole food plant based diet that you are already on and add flaxseed every day . bonus , in contrast to possible death , side effects of flax include improved blood pressure control , improved cholesterol , and improved glucose ! woohoo ! hope this helps ! for online information , dr. kharrazian and dr. siebecker are at the cutting edge of sibo treatment and understanding. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = am7kr-vp0ys ( at 18 : 20 ) and http : / / www.siboinfo.com / the links suggested by julie are very good . the neural-motor pathway is a new idea but it really makes sense , i will surely look after it more deeply . also check : http : / / fixyourgut.com / treatment-of-gerd-protocol-1-sibo / here are herbal alternatives . currently i try peppermint oil , it relieves the muscles , reduces stress in guts , therefore enhances motility . also i realized , that i unvoluntary contract my stomach muscles sometimes , as a kind of stress reaction and i see it as a trigger , as the natural movements cant work themeselves out because of constant contraction , so currently im working on that also , learning to relax my muscles and also find unused muscles . in relaxation meditation can help . also as one page mentioned , one major component in herbal antibiotics against sibo was berberine , goldenseal is a good source . some say you have to make an antibiotic protocol ( let it be herbal or not ) and starving them out is really hard , almost non achievable.my personal experience : eating a lots of fruit especially in the wrong order / timing can enhance sibo . i think mine began when i suddenly began to ate lots of legumes ( 3-4 hrs digestion time ) then i ate a dessert that contained sugar ( ~ 20 minutes until fermentation begins ) . so its also true for fruits , i learnt many things from checking out food combination charts like this http : / / kaleuniversity.org / 54791-digestive-health-is-in-the-combining / , especially fruits , eat it on empty stomach first the most acidic , with peppermint oil . like i eat a kiwi and some strawberries with 3 drops peppermint oil in a gulp of water , than wait 30-60 minutes , 3 drops peppermint oil , and apple , 30-60 minutes , then i eat a banana . also combining with fodmap and scd charts , watching myself and feeling my body really helps . also i dont suggest eating flax seed blindly , for example my problem with apple + flax seed is the flax takes much longer to digest and the little seed fragments become a food for the bacteria , also thats the problem with blackberries , but if i would strain and grind the blackberry seeds it would be much better , maybe no symptoms . i found out soaking my seeds in yoghurt can help even if i eat spelt flakes with them . sometimes i feel like eating some cocoa powder with my yoghurt might help and it makes sense , because it makes the food denser slows the digestion so the yoghurt can match up with the seeds in digestion time . density and water content is also very important , its like jams and preservers , the overly watery and fibrous ones are the most prone to fermentation.one of the main thing is you have to starve out your bacteria and help your gut motility in every way . chewing very wisely and slowly , relaxed mind and body . i eat much more cooked vegetables , i cut the very fibrous ones very small , crosswise the fibers . there are many tricks . also i suggest to go back to point zero and drink chicken broth in the morning . exercise wisely and much because as you get older , you forget to use some muscle and overuse some others . once i took a one day motorcycle training , i used many muscles that i havent for a long time , learning to lean in curves knee down etc … and that day i had a really healthy bowel movement … that really shows something isnt it ? some more suggetions : before sibo i ate lots of banana because they taste really good now its not so important . my favourite ones now are : kiwi , strawberries , blueberries . apple only wisely but i try to eat one a day . when i eat a banana , sometimes i eat a third or a half only , i choose the soft , more brown spotted ones , faster to digest . dont overeat , rather undereat and see what symptoms develop , then eat more according . eat spelt rather then plain wheat , its less prone to fermentation . eat proper , healthy starch , for example my morning cereal is spelt flakes , but if i include amla cooked to a right consistency it can make me feel better , i just watched a video here that mentioned more starch can increase bulk of bowel movements and remove lots of toxins.i eat ground anise and cinnamon with it and it helps . include fats wisely , sometimes they help to make an overly watery food less reachable for bacteria , sometimes an other food less sticky and more easier to slide through the intestines . really watch the densities and contents of different types ( seeds , fibers , oils ) etc … it ’ s not only the chemical content but the physical build up of food . see eating lots of fruit can mean many things , if i would eat fibrous , med-hard , sour kiwies i would be in trouble , eating the soft , almost translucent fleshed ones , i have no problems . eating seeds soaked in yoghurt , if they are too dense because of the too much seed i have problems , if too much yoghurt ( food in a fluid solution , where the bacteria can “ swim ” through ) , i have problems . eating this on its own really slowly , no problems , eating it fast , problems , eating it with lots of cereals , problems , not so much cereals i can eat all at once , without problems.rifaximin works only in the gut , but if you ’ d like a more natural solution , try sovereign silver . it ’ s made from silver , which is a potent antibiotic , and promoted by naturopaths around the country . this will help with your overgrowth of bad bacteria . if you do take the rifaximin and are worried about clostridium difficile infection ( which you should be worried about ) , take florastor brand probiotics . this will help replace the good bacteria to your gut , and this brand contains a yeast , saccromyces boulardii , which prevents the clostridium difficile bacterium from attaching to your intestines . hope this was helpful ! i always place my fruits & vegetables a stainless steel bowl filled with tap water where they soak until needed . i usually notice soil accumulation at the bottom of the soak bowl which is satisfying and has motivated me to continue the practice.who wants to eat dirt ? i believe i will be implement a new two bowl procedure soaking first in a salt water bath and then to a bath of straight tap water . thank you dr. greger for the tip.michael pollan observed that humans evolved eating dirt because they didn ’ t have modern kitchens to prep their food . he theorizes that we might be wise to eat more dirt . i don ’ t actively try to add dirt to my diet , but since reading that i don ’ t worry about how well i rinse dirt off of my bok choy , celery or other veggies . same with bacteria . getting rid of the bad stuff might also preclude us from getting enough of the good stuff . you can ’ t pick and choose when you “ clean ” . so i tend to not worry so much . so when you ask who wants to eat dirt , well … technically , i think do.mark , the evolving humans also carried parasites . i would wash my food.i ’ m not fond of pin worms or listeria found in soil samples . the pin worms are reason enough to say “ no ” to eating soil not to mention the 20 % fatality of intracellular listeriosis.i have heard similar arguments as it pertains to vegans getting additional vitamin b12 by eating dirt , but i prefer taking my b12 in the form of a weekly sublingual lozenge which is much more reliable . i find pollan ’ s ideas interesting in as much as they have fostered discussion and debate about food and how it is produces , but i never found them particularly compelling , nor do i share in his dilemma.finally , a healthy use for table salt.how is this for a postulation for the reason for the efficacy for a salt water bath on extracting herbicides and pesticides ? osmosis a.k.a , osmotic pressure.fruits and vegetables have a high concentration of water . placing them in a salt water bath will cause some of the water in the fruits and vegetables into the saline solution for the surface tissues of the the items being soaked taking with it some portion of any herbicides and pesticides that have been sprayed onto them.thank you , what about the wax on apples , do i need to scrub the wax before cleaning the apple ? and … what about the side effects of the wax itself ? jamie : neither vinegar nor salt water can remove wax . removal of wax requires a detergent.not sure about ways to remove wax . aren ’ t some apples sold without wax ? i ’ m with you , i always see that “ glossy shine ” in the grocery store and am like “ huh ” ? i try to find the ugliest produce in the market : ) seems weird when i checkout and i have a $ 50 bill for like 3 miserable looking carrots , but i know the carrots are lower in pesticides and i seem to think i can taste the difference . obviously i am over exaggerating and just giving an example . my point is , buying organic ( or even better ) , supporting your farmer ’ s markets and talking with the growers may help cut costs on the grocery bill while also finding quality produce without wax.apples produce wax naturally . it serves as a harmless , natural preservative . there is no need to “ strip ” it.really ? i was pretty sure they coat most apples , but looking into it you are absolutely right . fda claims that additional wax is applied sometimes after the initial yield because when they are washed to remove dirt some of the natural wax comes off . thanks for the correction ! i learn something new here everyday . agreed that if you strip the skin you miss out on the important antioxidants in the fruit.i have picked unsprayed apples off trees in the fall and they are always “ oily ” and waxy naturally . but i think that industry also waxes them up further for long term storage.we have a marvelous farmers ’ market , but the prices are definitely not cheaper than , say , organic veggies from our food co-op.a while ago i read something online that said you fill a sink with water and add about 1 cup of white vinegar ( don ’ t know exact ratio so don ’ t think its extremely important ) and stir . you then add fruit . water will get dirty and fruit will sparkle with no wax or dirty film left , like what is usually seen on apples and grapes respectively . also , this wash is great for berries too and keeps them from molding ; strawberries last for weeks.this is a great , informative video . i am so glad i have discovered your website . thank you ! the video graphic shares that a five minute soak and thorough rinse before using is required . sea salt is better than table / iodized for the obvious reasons . i use this method and am thoroughly pleased ! here ’ s to safe eating ! is the saltwater a 10 % mixture by weight or by volume ? that is a great question the paper i read on potatoes did not specify . let me look at the others and get back to you . thanksusually in a lab , a 10 % nacl solution is 10g nacl in 100 ml water ( you complete the volume to 100 ml after adding the salt ) .it ’ s the same ! i tried it out on my scale at home . 1 tb salt weighs 14 g and 10 tbs of water weighs 140 g . so it is 10 % by both volume and weight.to anyone with access to the zohair paper , dr. greger , or joseph : is the 10 % nacl solution indeed by volume ( as insinuated by “ 1 part salt , 9 parts water ” ) or is by mass ? i know salt is cheap , but using almost half a cup per liter of water doesn ’ t sound practical to me.10 % ( v / v ) would mean 100 ml ( 6.75 tbsp ) per liter of water 10 % ( m / m ) or ( m / v ) would mean about 46 ml ( 3 tbsp ) per liter of waterso by mass would be better , but i ’ m still not sure how practical it seems . is this a soak , or could one make up a small bowl to manually and individually wash fruits / veggies in it and then do a final rinse in water ? to soak all the fruits and veggies we buy would require a large volume of water , i ’ m thinking at least a gallon at a time.b00mer : watching the video , i wondered about this too . usually , v / v is used to show the percent composition of a solution of two or more liquids . a solution of salt is a solution of a solid and and a liquid , so m / m would be the traditional choice . since the density of water at room temperature is approximately 1 and the solution made is pretty dilute , m / m is roughly the same as m / v. i guess we need to read the paper to find exactly what the authors meant . whichever it is , i agree with you , soaking every vegetable and fruit i eat in a salt solution everyday would be a time consuming task.hi matt , i too would have assumed m / m or m / v except for dr. greger ’ s use of the word “ parts ” which is usually used in layman ’ s terms to indicate v / v.i wouldn ’ t mind soaking or washing with a small amount of salt if i could just do it once per week . but per dr. greger ’ s recipe 1 gallon of soak water would require almost 1 2 / 3 cups of salt ! i can ’ t imagine buying a big jar of salt every few weeks . even though it ’ s < $ 1 , it still would feel wasteful.do you have access to a database with this paper ? b00mer : i have the paper ( which i haven ’ t read yet . ) but i ’ m afraid i ’ m not allowed to post it on any open websites . i wonder if i could email it to disque and they could email it to you.thanks matt ! i really appreciate the offer but with this article i don ’ t actually feel the need to read the whole thing . was just curious about that one piece of info . to be honest , personally my fruit / veggie policy is buy what ’ s available and affordable , wash with tap water , and hope for the best . but let us know what you find out when you get a chance to read it ! b00mer : the authors simple say that they used a 10 % nacl solution , so we have to assume that they follow the standard practice , which is 10 g of salt in 100 g of solution . to make it , 10 g of salt must be dissolved in 90 g of water . assuming that the density of water is 1 g / ml , 1 gallon of water has to be mixed with about 416 g of salt , which would give > 1 gallon of the solution . wow , that ’ s approaching i lb of salt . not something most of us can do everyday.i ’ ll send to you ! joseph , thank you so much ! i really appreciate it , but i don ’ t think i actually need a copy of this one . got enough reading to do right now ! but thanks again : ) cool cool : ) p.s. i hope my original comment didn ’ t come across as poo-pooing dr. greger ’ s suggestion . i ’ ve seen questions about pesticides and fruit / veggie washes come up a lot on this site over the years and here he has so nicely found out the answer for us ! i might not choose to employ this technique with my own produce but i still enjoyed learning about it.this is an interesting video but nothing more . highly impractical for most of us as you mentioned.we need to support more organic and stricter rules for pesticide use.they soaked for 10 minutes in the zohair paper on potatoes . finding out about weight vs volume . thanks b00mer ! i ’ m more concerned about systemic pesticide risks . aren ’ t these chemicals incorporated into the tissues of the plants ? are you asking if pesticides are sprayed on produce will they appear in the actual tissue of plants vs the surface ? yes , i think both occur and depending on how porous the plant is ( think about the tough / thick skin on watermelon and bananas vs. soft fruit like berries ) will determine how much pesticide leaches into the produce.or is melissa asking about pesticides picked up by the roots and distributed throughout the plant ? yes they are ! high school science project with 2,4d proved that what is put on one plant ’ s leaves will go through the plant and out the roots into the soil or water to another plant separated above the soil / water line by a partition . both plants died . we can wash away what is on the outside , but not what is on the inside . so , peeling a carrot or cuke to get rid of the pesticides / herbicides does not make the food free of said poisons ! i live as an ngo worker in a developing country . we soaked all produce 20 minutes in bleach water for years . blech ! vinegar is a sure fire according to a very old california infectious diseases manual , but it sucks all the water out of the food ! limp , practically cooked lettuce for supper ? no thanks ! i soak to kill amoeba , salmonella , etc , much more than get rid of the chemicals … many fruits and vegetables sold in health food stores are safe to eat without washing . the current issue of consumerreports ( may issue , page 31 ) , has a chart showing 48 fruits and vegetables with info concerning pesticides , based on contemporary research . highly recommended ! the cost of organic products is always high , so it makes a lot of sense to know which foods are safe from conventional markets.that ’ s good to know about pesticides . wish i still had my cr subscription so i could read it . although something to keep in mind is that bacterial contamination ( unless addressed in that issue as well ? ) may still be a risk especially for youngsters and the elderly with undeveloped or compromised immune systems.i follow bill marler on twitter . he ’ s the attorney who won that old cantaloupe case and many others since . he also has an excellent website / blog with videos about pathogen contamination on food , marlerblog.com. ( not for the ‘ don ’ t-tell-me-i-don ’ t-want-to-know ’ crowd . ) on 4 / 30 he reported on the canadian listeria outbreak being linked to apple slices . after learning much from him i always wash my fruits & veggies . well , almost always ; there ’ s a cafeteria near us that has a huge salad bar – not organic . i ’ m “ trusting ” they wash the food ( and their hands ! ) .maybe so as far as pesticides or pathogens , but these products have been handled . how many times do people touch just to determine freshness ? maybe they dropped on a dirty floor and were quickly picked up . strongly suggest : wash the stuff . you don ’ t know where it ’ s been.i am a breast cancer survival . in dana farber hospital in boston they told me to wash the veg and fruit in one cup vinegar one part water juice from half a lemon and 1 tb of baking soda . dip in solution then leave it out for 5 minute and then rinse with water . it works wonderful and very easy.is that one cup vinegar to one cup water ? and one tablespoon baking soda ? thank you so much for sharing this recipe and where you got it ! interesting thanks for sharing that , drorit ! i know a few dietitians at dana farber . warm thoughts and best to you ! i do not have purchased the study about salt soaking . in the study abstract they speak from achieving the results through 20 minutes of soaking . how come that in the video they speak from 5 minutes ? good question . all of the studies use different soaking times . the study on tomatoes used a soak time of 5 minutes . if you want to read any of the studies in full shoot me your email or contact us . thanks , eric.so we can wash with soap to kill the bacteria first , then wash with salt water to get rid of the pesticides ? i ’ m pretty sure most harmful bacteria is destroyed by the salt water . hence the practice of nasal rinsing with neti pots , etc with a salt-bicarbonate solution is often recommended by otolaryngologists as a prophylactic for sufferers of chronic sinusitis . i ’ m a lay person here so take my comments with a grain of salt ! ( i made myself laugh ! ) : -pyou made me laugh too ; - ) i wonder if this suggest that adding salt to the diet , even from natural sea salts , might end up killing beneficial bacteria in our gut . seems like a strong possibility to me.i would not recommend washing with soap.dr greger recommended against soap in one of his videos . no science exists on chemical reactions btwn soap / detergents and pesticides.i ’ ve used thinned out 7th generation dish liquid on my apples and courgettes , not broccoli or berries or lettuces , for a while now , but soap doesn ’ t really kill germs , and no it doesn ’ t leave an after taste but i rinse thoroughly . i wouldn ’ t use dawn or anything from a animal testing company . however , soap is only a surfactant that dissolves grease and maybe some residues . after seeing this video , i ’ m likely to mix up a little salt water next time.hey , how about answering to the questions below ? ! surely ! sometimes it takes a while to reply . thanks for your patience.how long a 1 : 10 salt : water soak required to dissolve pesticide residue ? and are we right to assume dr. greger meant by volume ( as opposed to weight ) ? yes , you could assume that . i looked up the potato study and it doesn ’ t seems the researchers did not distinguish concentrations by weight or volume . each study varied in soaking time . for the salt studies they soaked for 20 minutes . i ’ ll find out about concentrations and post asap . thanks , cathy.thanks so much joseph ! salt soak long enough , you get brined veggies , which doesn ’ t rinse off.you could shoot for 5-10 minutes if you want that seems more doable.thanks joseph . i wonder which is the greater evil for most folks : removing the maximum amount of pesticidal residue in a salt solution , or increasing sodium intake from the salt bath ’ s absorption in the produce ? especially for those with high b.p. , perhaps a good wash with plain water would be preferable ? haha ! yes , it is all relative isn ’ t it ? we all have to make the best decisions possible ( and the ones that makes sense ) based on our individual situation . great points , and yes i think rinsing after the soak process is important . i think wade mentioned the idea that you could have a brine salt bath by the time you ’ re done , which of course would not be so good.if you look at the chart @ 4 : 44 this vid , you ’ ll see salt water and 5 minutes indicated . please clarify ? you know what i just saw that too ! there are two studies : 1 ) the one conducted on potatoes soaked for 10 min. and 2 ) the one you reference at 4 : 44 looked at cabbage and had different soaking times from 5-20 minutes . do you want me to send it to you in full ? sorry for the confusion i am not sure there is a certain amount of time to soak.two different studies . one was testing potatoes and the other cabbage . the potato tests used a 10 minute soak time , and the cabbage anywhere from 5 , 10 , and 20 minutes . let me know if you ’ d like any in full . i was having a hard time grasping all the information . i edited my comment above as it was a bit misleading . thanks for the catch , wade.josephi suppose _ any _ time beats no time ( soaking ) . i had been lax in washing-but now that i know how to do a more effective job , i ’ ll wash / soak / rinse with authority ! thanks.volume or weight i am unsure the researchers do not specify from what i could tell.here in costa rica where if you live here at least a year , it is almost impossible to avoid parasitic infections even with organic foods . thank you for this video.great information . very helpful.thank you so much for this video . i ’ ve been avoiding the wash personally since it seems to just sit there and i rarely see it in peoples carts . i figured if i didn ’ t hear that much about it in the vegan community it was a waste . good to see it is . the salt water is interesting.so maybe we should be showering / bathing our bodies with a rag dipped in salt water , and forgoing the using soap on our bodies ? makes sense to me based on some of the science here.thank you ! we benefit from the how – to videos just as much as the why videos . my kales were decimated last summer by caterpillars but hopefully this year i ’ ll be a bit more prepared . now i understand why my fellow gardeners talk about the appearance of white butterfly as if it is a threat to national security.i am surprised they didn ’ t test regular old dish soap . i think that would have been effective against many of the fat soluble pesticide residues.it bonds to the permeable produce skin and isn ’ t good to consume.it depends on the brand and from what it is made . natural soaps not tested on animals with no synthetic dyes or perfumes are fine if cut with water.nice.what does not being tested on animals have to do with how edible a soap is ? because i don ’ t recommend anything tested on animals as its cruel and unnecessary . most of the soaps made with basic oil or plant ingredients aren ’ t toxic and wouldn ’ t require testing anyway . if they were accidentally ingested in minimal amounts , they wouldn ’ t be harmful . surfactants made with these basic ingredients tend to rinse with no residue from synthetic dyes or perfumes left on food . its not that difficult to figure out , really.may i have permission to submit this article with properly cited references to the link at the top of your website page ? hi dr. misner . yes – you are certainly free to post any study you feel can help our community here . that would be great.thank you , josephin the paper with the salt water wash and others , the produce was in the “ bath ” for 20 minutes . what would that translate to if the fruit or kale or whatever were rubbed with hands etc ? the concentration was mentioned in this video , but not how long to spend washing to be effective.so glad you addressed this topic . i ’ m currently using vinegar and lemon juice water . salt sounds like a great option . it ’ s magical on tooth aches and sore throats ! love you , dr. gregor ! ! saw this study on another food site and can ’ t understand how this conclusion was reached … .. help.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20685950 ? dopt = abstractplushi mary . have you read the conclusion ? some very good points there . i ’ ll copy and paste here in hopes it might help . “ the limitations of this study warrant discussion . first , we used an ffq with only 33 food items to identify sfa intake and death certificates to define events . – ( goes onto say ) – assuming that the inverse association between sfa and stroke mortality is causal , it would nevertheless be inappropriate to recommend an increased consumption of sfa-containing products to the general japanese population , because it might increase population levels of total cholesterol and the risk of ihd . replacing sfa with pufa had no benefit on the prevention of ihd , which contrasts with a recent pooling project of americans and europeans ( 6 ) . application of discrepant results to public health practice must be cautious . we believe that this discrepancy could be explained in part by a low distribution of sfa intake among japanese . the median sfa intake , albeit underestimated by ≈ 37 % , was very low ( 9.4 g / d ) . it is well known that the sfa intake is far lower in japan than in western countries ; for example , the median intake of sfas for the highest quartile of a japanese rural population ( 1970 – 1980s ) was 17 g / d ( 16 ) lower than that for the lowest quartile of intake in the nurses ’ health study in 1980 ( 20 g / d ) ( 11 ) . these findings indicated almost no overlap of sfa intakes between the 2 populations . ” from what i gather , it ’ s hard to build sfa recommendations based on japanese populations . they consume very little sfas . even the authors do not recommend eating more sfas because it may increase cholesterol levels and boost heart disease risk . for more info on saturated fat , if interested , but this may be more relevant why saturated fat studies are set-up to fail.finally , some definitive news on whether these veggie rinses do anything . i have long wondered about this and i think i willo begin selectively soaking veggies in salt water . thanks for news we can use ! i haven ’ t seen anything yet in this series about the levels of pesticides vis-a-vis levels having potential for harm , only “ detectable ” and “ whatever risk there is . ” can those of us interested in costs-versus-benefits be such a small group ? ok folks lets not get crazy here but why not make a solution with vinegar , salt , water ( even baking soda if you want to get a little nuts ) and go for it . rub then let soak 20 minutes ! ! ! ! then rinseif you dont have time to wait make a spray solution of the same : spray on rub together , let sit and then rinse ! ! ! ! i will add anything is better than nothing , studies are just that , case studies . they are not always practical in every way to regular every day life . the big take away ! i have always used vinegar and water to soak for 20 – 30 min , but now salt is going in that mixture ! why not ! i ’ ve always used 1 / 3 hydrogen peroxide , 1 / 3 straight white vinegar , 2 tbsps. of soap , 1 / 3 water and thought it cleans well , i may start adding salt to my combo now.great info . i soaked the “ commercially grown ” celery in a saline solution this morning for the our soup kitchen ’ s spaghetti sauce . over 100 needy people got a meal with reduced contaminants . your work is a blessing to so many.that is a coincidence ! this video comes just in time as i was searching the internet for a self made vegetables wash . thank you dr. greger.disposing of salty water to a greywater system that is used to grow plants would build up salt in the soil over time and most plants wouldn ’ t like that . vinegar soak water would be better to dispose to a greywater system used to grow plants particulary when the soil and soak water is alkaline to begin with.how many grams or tablespoons of salt for a cup of water ? how long is the soaking / wash process ? it ’ s a 1 : 10 ratio of salt / water . the soaking times all varied from 5-20 minutes in the studies so it ’ s hard to say . please see my comments below and others as well because they have some good ideas of how to put this research to use . thanks.thank you so much ! very interesting and thorough . so i need to get some cheap salt and soak my veggies in 10 % solution if they aren ’ t organic . sounds pretty straight forward . thanks so much for another big help for my health.wouldn ’ t be a bad idea if they are organic even . organics also use pesticides , just ones that aren ’ t on the current inorganic list.don ’ t pesticides build up in the plants ? if the pesticides end up in the soil , aren ’ t they also inside the plants and fruit ? yes , but the compounds are quite dilute at that point . concentration goes up as the foodchain is ascended . lower on the foodchain is thereby safer . zero is preferred , but that may not be possible now that we ’ ve gunked up the works.hello , has anyone used plain charcoal , carbon for removing certain pesticides when washing fruits and vegetables ? activated charcoal is used to purify water … .how to make your own fruit and vegetable wash : 1 part salt , 9 parts water.you ’ re welcome.this article is very good news indeed . certainly simple washing in water becomes a no-brainer with the 10 % salt-water solution more great news ! one caveat though , before i rate this at 5stars . perhaps it was not within the purview of this article , to attempt to ascertain whether or not pesticides enter through the outer layer of skin of fruits and vegetables and to what extent . sprays are administered during the flowering stages early on . these pesticides must surely become part of the fruit itself * below * the outer skin . we now know for instance that monsanto ’ s roundup is used as a desiccant , one week prior to harvesting oats and wheat , to assure a certain % dryness . the latest findings are that glyphosate disrupts human enzymes invitro , at parts / trillion . one last point , could you have your webmaster insert a follow link , to let us know when there are respondents to our comments postings . this has become more common and it saves us time looking back.hello ! what about to use some ozone machines ? water and ozone … i meani don ’ t know much about ozone and water . i researched it and a few studies are available . i suggest reading the abstract of this study , and also this one . it seems there is limited research , but it may be useful for veggie washing.how “ bout a salt and vinegar wash ? i wonder if anyone has any thoughts about these bentonite clay capsules that are also supposed to “ bind ” the pops that are in our food supply ? hi jimr . i checked on this and could not find any data . i am not sure this is the same clay , but i found one study about kids using clay to lower aflatoxin build-up in ghana . perhaps not very relevant ? anyway , if i find more i ’ ll be sure to post . thanks for your comment.what about baking soda ? i have not seen as much on baking soda . for oral health it may be useful . my hope is others can help comment on this as well , as so many folks here have these great questions about finding ways to reduce pesticide exposure ! as requested by dr. greger ’ s team , here is my comment i messaged them … in dr . g ’ s video about washing fruits and veg with salt water to remove pesticides , i don ’ t recall him saying why this effective . is it because the nacl become ions in aqueous solution , thus attracting the positively charges pesticide molecules ? or is there another reason ? does baking soda work as well ? i use baking soda ( and vinegar for my grapes to decrease mold , it works ! ) . also sometimes i ’ ll use bentonite clay powder in water since it is highly negatively charged and binds to e pesticides . i feel baking soda u is even cheaper than salt since i buy sea salt . thanks ! ! ! please excuse the typos made by my ipad.thanks for reposting , chris . good question do you know if the researcher ’ s talk about the “ whys ” in their papers ? you can always look up the individual studies by clicking on “ sources cited ” for further investigation . if you cannot find let me know i ’ ll dig up ! thanks again , chris. animal products , bacon , cheese , chicken , cooking methods , dairy , ddt , dishwashing detergent , eggs , fat , fish , fruit , fruit and vegetable wash , industrial pollutants , lettuce , meat , organic foods , pesticides , potatoes , poultry , salt , strawberries , tgi friday 's , tomatoes , vegetables , vinegar , water commercial fruit and vegetable washes fail to work better than tap water , but there is a cheap do-it-yourself solution that may completely eliminate certain pesticide residues . this is a bit of an intermission in my 5-part series on organic foods . so far i ’ ve covered the questions are organic foods more nutritious ? and are organic foods safer ? next , i ’ m going to wrap it up with what i think the available science suggests is the bottom-line when it comes to choosing which type of produce to buy in the final two in the series : the most important reason to wash produce is to reduce the risk of food-borne illness . ironically , the food poisoning viruses may be found in the pesticides themselves . check out my video norovirus food poisoning from pesticides .
PLAIN-2459	how to prevent a stroke high dietary fiber intake may prevent strokes . the belief that dietary fiber intake is protectively associated to some diseases was postulated 40 years ago and then enormously fuelled and kept alive by a great body of science since . today it is therefore generally believed that eating lots of fiber helps prevent obesity , diabetes , and cardiovascular diseases such as stroke . strokes are the second most common cause of death worldwide . moreover , stroke is a leading cause of disability and so preventing strokes in the first place – what ’ s called primary prevention , should therefore , be a key public health priority . all best studies to date found that fiber appears to significantly protect against the risk of stroke . different strokes for different folks , depending , evidently , on how much fiber they ate . notably , increasing fiber just 7 grams a day was associated with a significant 7 % reduction in stroke risk . and 7 grams is easy , like a small serving of whole grain pasta with tomato sauce and an apple.what ’ s the mechanism ? well fiber helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels . or could just be we ’ re just eating more vegetables , or fewer calories , or less meat and fat , or improving digestion , slimming us down , lower our blood pressure and the amount of inflammation within our bodies . does it really matter though ? as dr. burkitt commented on the biblical passage that reads “ a man scatters seed on the land — the seed sprouts and opens — how , he does not know , ” but he doesn ’ t wait to find out . had the farmer postponed his sowing until he understood seed germination , he would not have lasted very long . so yes , let ’ s keep trying to figure out why fiber is protective , but in the meanwhile we should be increasing our intake of fiber , which is to say whole plant foods.and it ’ s never too early . strokes are one of many complications of arterial stiffness . though our first stroke might not happen until our 50s , our arteries may have been stiffening for decades leading up to it . hundreds of kids were followed for 24 years , from age 13 in junior high through age 36 , and they found that the lower intake of fiber during young age is associated with stiffening of the arteries leading up to the brain , and so we need to promote consumption of fiber-rich foods among the young . in fact even by age 13 they could see differences in arterial stiffness depending on diet . this emphasizes the view that increases in fiber intake should be pursued already among young children.and again , it doesn ’ t take much . one extra apple a day or an extra quarter cup of broccoli might translate to meaningful differences in arterial stiffness in adulthood , but if you really don ’ t want a stroke , we should try to get 25 grams a day of soluble fiber , which is found in beans , oats , nuts , and berries , and 47 grams a day of insoluble fiber , found primarily in whole grains . one would have to eat an extraordinarily healthy diet to get that much , yet these cut-off values could be considered as the minimum recommended daily intake of soluble and insoluble fiber , to prevent stroke . they admit these are higher than those commonly and arbitrarily proposed as “ adequate ” levels by scientific societies , but do we want to be patronized to as to what authorities think is practical , or do we want them to just tell us what the science says , like they did here ? someone funded by kellogg ’ s wrote in to complain that in practice such fiber intakes are unachievable . rather the message should just be the more , the better , ya know , just have a bowl of cereal or something.the real dr. kellogg , who was actually one of our most famous physicians , credited for being one of the first to sound the alarm about smoking , may have been the first american physician to have recognized the field of nutrition as a science , would today be rolling in his grave if he knew what his company had become . how important is the ratio of soluble to insoluble ? i average about 82g of fiber per day with many higher , and some less but i haven ’ t ever really looked at soluble vs insoluble before.hi mike , i shared some sources in my other comment that you can use to estimate your soluble intake . if you ’ re getting 82 g total , i ’ d estimate you ’ re easily getting 20-25 g soluble.hey mike . that is a lot of fiber ! fiber needs for adult men ( 38g ) and women ( 25g ) are measured as “ total fiber ” ( both insoluble and soluble ) . i think it ’ s good to have both in your diet , but if you ’ re eating so much fiber ( from the sound of it you have no problem there ) from a variety of whole-plant foods you really shouldn ’ t have to worry about soluble vs insoluble . dr. greger mentions guidelines on fiber recommendations here , and points out how this is just the minimum , which unfortunately many americans do not meet.thanks , for the link . yes , lots of fiber on a high carb whole foods plant based diet . and no problems personally . certainly more regular than in my past on a standard american diet.does anyone know if there is evidence arterial stiffness in adulthood can be reversed by any change in diet ? absolutely ! “ just as food is the prime cause of our culture ’ s heart-disease woes , it is also , ironically , the answer to them . dr. esselstyn ’ s program eliminates the food-based substances that wreak havoc on your endothelium , replacing them with healthful , plant-based foods . freed from the toxicity of fats , animal proteins and processed carbs , your body ’ s inner workings change for the better . here ’ s what happens : your endothelium ( that magic carpet of cells that lines your arteries ) begins pumping out nitric oxide again ; your blood vessels regain their flexibility , and the sludge lining your arteries dissolves and clears out , all allowing unimpeded blood flow to your heart . participants in dr. esselstyn ’ s study showed these amazing reversals and , by continuing to follow a plant-based diet on an ongoing basis , remained free of symptoms — without further high-cost surgical interventions ! ” http : / / www.clevelandclinicwellness.com / conditions / coronaryarterydisease / pages / detox-your-diet-and-heart-attack-proof-your-life.aspx # highly recommend “ prevent & reverse heart disease ” by dr. caldwell esselstyn : http : / / www.amazon.com / prevent-reverse-heart-disease-nutrition-based / dp / 1583333002hi rd . i agree with b00mer . dr. esselstyn published research showing how a plant-based diet can be “ a way to reverse cad ? ” . meat can cause inflammation and saturated fat appears to have other deleterious effects such as increasing the risk of heart disease . “ a nutritionally poor dietary pattern , characterized by a high meat and alcohol consumption and low micronutrients intake , is related to an increased stiffening of large arteries . ” other foods that may help arterial stiffness are turmeric and coffee . hope this helps . “ in practice such fiber intakes are unachievable ” like so many things … unless you ’ re on a whole foods vegan diet.if anyone ’ s interested , a few sources useful for estimating soluble fiber intake in particular , the data for which is a bit more elusive than total fiber : http : / / www.globalrph.com / fiber _ content _ soluble.htm http : / / www.ars.usda.gov / sp2userfiles / place / 80400525 / articles / jfca15 _ 715-723.pdf http : / / ocw.tufts.edu / data / 47 / 531408.pdf http : / / www.dietitians.ca / getattachment / 3bb6330f-0ab2-48fc-9d24-1303ad70003d / factsheet-food-sources-of-soluble-fibre.pdf.aspx https : / / www.prebiotin.com / resources / fiber-content-of-foods / kellogg ’ s knows what sells more unsatiating , i-want-seconds-and-thirds cereal . that ’ s their rationale.i don ’ t know how people can function on a bowl of cereal in the morning ! a couple , like grape nuts have some substance to them , but most are like cotton candy.original cereal was just grains . i eat a big bowl of oatmeal in the morning and i am good until lunch , every time ! much appreciative of the time you took to post these links , thank you ! thank you for the links . i noticed something surprising in the paper in the second link : even soft white bread , purportedly the nutritionally worst kind of bread , has a lot of insoluble fiber.hi ben , regarding the white bread , i looked at a couple calorie counters , and it does appear that some reduced calorie white breads have a couple grams of ( added ) fiber per slice , with each slice only weighing about 20 – 25 g , which would indeed give a value of about 8 – 9 g total fiber per 100 g as the paper says . these equate to about 0.035 g fiber per calorie.however if you notice , the regular soft or firm white breads are only 1.5 – 2.6 g total fiber per 100 g , so these breads , which are what most people are thinking about when they hear “ white bread ” only average about 0.4 – 0.7 g total fiber per slice . these equate to about six-fold lower fiber content by calorie ( 0.0056 g fiber / cal ) .all the whole wheat breads i looked at had at least as much as the reduced calorie white breads or more . complicating this matter however is their use of “ wheat bread ” instead of “ whole wheat bread ” in several entries . among those i looked at , whole wheat breads appear to average about 0.4 g per calorie.so for fiber , wonder bread is still not a good source as we all most likely intuitively knew . however reduced calorie fiber supplemented white breads appear to be similar to some whole wheat breads in total fiber content . however this is pretty much like taking a fiber supplement , so if one wants their fiber from whole food sources , whole wheat bread would still be the answer.in reality , john harvey kellogg would not be surprised at all by the sugary tack the kellogg ’ s company has taken.sugar as an ingredient in his corn flake invention was the reason his brother will keith kellogg broke ranks with john harvey and founded the battle creek toasted corn flake company on february 19 , 1906 , now our present-day kellogg ’ s multinational corporation.btw kellogg ’ s also owns gardenburger and morningstar.i was just about to comment this , but was unaware if someone else had mentioned it previously , sooo i looked . i concur after investigating / watching documentaries about the kellogg brothers . they were like night and day , or realistically , evil and good . a benevolent brother opposed to the corrupt , greedy , health-sacrificing ways of his brother , and the other brother only concerned with money and capitalism most despicable aspect  — the lack of interest in it ’ s population ’ s health … .very sad to see the good guy lose . welcome to amurica.stroke is actually the worst manifestation of cvd . heart attack kills you or leave you with angina , which can be treated through dietary intervention , medication or surgery . on the other hand stroke leaves you with paralysis , afasia , emotional incontinence and cognitive problems – and if you are lucky you will also get epilepsy . the consequences are permanent . doctors will prescribe a lot of medication to prevent an other stroke – but it is too late ! ! ! stroke is reason enough to do everything you can to prevent cvd – go plant strong ! ! ! it ’ s aphasia , ( loss of language ) . thanks . laurie ms ccc / slp , specch-lang . pathologistit ’ s speech … … … . ; - ) i won ’ t argue that stroke is devastating but partial recovery is often possible with a lot of support . read the incredible “ my stroke of insight ” by brain scientist jill bolte taylor or watch her ted talk here : http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jill _ bolte _ taylor _ s _ powerful _ stroke _ of _ insightyou are right . i have previously worked at a stroke unit and partial recovery is possible with intensive training through months . i have seen patients getting their second and third stroke , and i have seen patients with big infarcts in one hemisphere getting their second stroke in the other hemisphere leaving them with tetraparesis . prevention is so important . i have also seen patients deeply unconscious with oedema in one hemisphere ( ct scan ) , suggesting huge media infarction , walking around the next day without any symptom at all ! the brain is fantastic ! yes , of course , the critical piece is prevention . and , yes , the brain is an incredible organ ( like all of the other amazing organs in our bodies ! ) hiwhat ’ s your opinion of the ideas of these two books ? 1 ) grain brain2 ) wheat belly : lose the wheat , lose the weight , and find your path back to healththanksmost people on this list will probably hate both books . i think we have to think that the goal of dr. greger / fuhrman / barnard is different than the goal of perlmutter / mercola / weston price / paleos . greger et al emphasize cvd , while perlmutter et al emphasize alzheimer ’ s , gluten inflammation , and diabetes . perlmutter grudgingly admits that he eats more vegetables than meat and that high fat with high carb is disastrous for everything . for first group , the solution is low fat , all carb ok . second group is low carb , all fat ok . i eat almost completely whole plant foods , with some coconut and olive oil , and a bit of free range organic eggs , butter and i eat meat about once a month . that ’ s what works best for me so far . john sthese books join a long list of books that sell alot of books but don ’ t contribute very much to improved health . it could be argued that they are detrimental . my patients over the last 40 years have often asked me what i think about this diet or that diet . the science keeps coming and we are learning more and more so we keep getting these books that focus on the latest simple solution or they push specific foods like my industry is guilty of pushing specific drugs . in my opinion you need to focus on the science and pay attention to credible sources without commercial interests . the ones i most frequently recommend are nutritionfacts.org , dr. john mcdougall and the physicians committee for responsible medicine . there are others as well … vegsource comes to mind . the good news for me is that the science over the last 40 years have provided the basis for good recommendations for patients . fat loss is about calorie density and exercise and pursuing the ad libitum diet ( eat when you are hungry just eat the right foods ) . dementia is looking like a nutritional disease with some metals thrown in plus some lifestyle issues such as sleep , exercise and cognitive activities … good reference is neal barnard ’ s power foods for your brain . when you realize that fat cells and muscle cells produce over 100 substances that interact with every cell in our body you get an idea for how complex our biological system is . as dr. campbell points out in his book , whole , there are limits to reductionistic science . i think it is important for patients to be given the best options and supported in their efforts . good luck in your journey to improved health.i ’ ve read that vegans are at higher risk for hemorrhagic stroke . is there any new information regarding this issue ? i am not aware of any specific studies . that said most intracerebral bleeds are due to the effects of blood pressure over time … higher makes for higher risk . whole food plant based diets are associated with lower blood pressures . of course strokes come in several varieties … thrombotic , hemmorhagic or embolic so the devil is in the details . overall current science supports a proper plant based diet lowers risk across all of them … not to mention avoiding alot of other chronic conditions leading to disability and earlier death.thank you for your quick reply . this is the article i read : http : / / img2.timg.co.il / forums / 1 _ 155647027.pdf “ despite the remarkably versatile protection afforded by a vegan diet , such a diet may not be an unalloyed blessing . asian and hawaiian epidemiology indicates that low serum cholesterol and low intakes of animal protein and fat are risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke ( 299 – 302 ) .

i assume you mean resveratrol from plants right ? not a supplement.hi veganrunner . you know i think that you live in paradise ! you find resveratrol in red wine , grapes , blueberries , peanuts and cocoa . resveratrol is actually a very interesting pharmaco active molecule . if you must utilize resveratrol as a “ natural ” drug it has to be as a supplement due to the small content in plants . that said i think you are better of with a mostly plant based diet including a little red wine , berries , nuts and so on , than a not so optimal diet and 250 mg resveratrol as a supplement . data suggests that supplementing with resveratrol decrease cardiovascular disease risk . animal data suggests prevention of various cancers , data suggests that resveratrol can reduce hypertension , improve insulin sensitivity and there is evidence that resveratrol can mimic the effect of calorie restriction , but i think that the latter is considered controversial . i think that longterm safety studies are lacking , so as with any supplementation you have to be a little carefull and consult an “ openminded ” physician before you start – if you can find one ! bottom line : resvertrol as a supplement is not an alternativ to a healthy diet ( plantbased ) .i ’ ve noticed that supplements get a thumbs down from dr. g sorta universally . it seems that because some studies have shown some supplements / vitamins caused harm ( like the endlessly quoted finnish carotene lung cancer horror ) therefore all supplements are bad . that is poor reasoning . take for example phytosterol . very difficult to get the 2 gram or higher effective dose eating plants . i took a gel cap and immediately saw my cholesterol dip. but i kept hearing the negatives about supplements so i stopped … .back up to 5 mm cholesterol in short order.so maybe … just possibly there is one supplement or even two or three that can do some good ? good question ! there are some interesting supplements out there . i think that one problem is that in general long term safety studies are lacking . if a supplement really is active you have to regard it as a “ medical ” drug – then you need to know about optimal dose , interactions , toxicity , long term safety , side effects , half-life , enzyme induction and so on . on the other hand it could be interesting to compare how many people has died or got seriously injured from prescription drugs vs supplements . the answer could be surprising … . i never recommend supplements to anyone , but if a person by themselves choose to take a supplement i would recommend to do some research first and preferably work with an “ open minded ” physician in the processhere is some loose adverse reaction info from a group battling regulation assault on supplements.http : / / www.anh-usa.org / ags-take-their-assault-on-supplements-to-congress / “ the testing regimens which the supplement industry are held to under cgmps are one reason that supplements have such a proven track record of safety — more so than food , not to mention fda-approved pharmaceuticals . one report from the government accountability office found that there were an average of 1,575 adverse event reports ( aers ) related to supplements per year between 2008 and 2011 . when you factor in that about half of americans ( 157 million people ) take supplements every day , this means that only one-hundredth of one percent of all supplement users ever experience any problems at all . it is also worth noting that aers are not concrete evidence of supplements being a factor in an adverse event , but simply a possible correlation . by contrast , in 2008 , there were 526,527 aers from pharmaceuticals — 488 times more than the number of supplement aers . our counterparts at anh-europe found that uk residents were about as likely to get struck by lightning as die from taking dietary supplements . ” very interesting – thanks ! i am a huge fan of yours . according to dr. hoffer , there has not been a single case of vitamin overdose related death in the past 25 years . this is interesting because men are told that iron is so bad for them . even if you have vegan patients , i would not be surprised if deficiencies of things such as tin , chromium , valadinium abound in them , like they do in most people . you have most people in agreement . except i don ’ t think most people are able to take the bus to buy the fruits and vegetables recommended with their current situation . this site is very useful to the 47 million americans on foodstamps who want to do better by their families.good point . perhaps it depends on diagnoses ? of course we love your comments and suggestions . if you ever come across any research please share with us ! thanks , gregor.thank you for your post . if you compare this site with orthomolecular medicine it seems these are two groups of people who are saying similar things but are being ignored by almost anyone who is paying attention . i heard preaching to the choir is a good thing . except the poor organist needs to see the people in the cheering section.how many grams are in these 2 tbsp of flax seeds ?

PLAIN-2469	if white rice is linked to diabetes , what about china ? rice currently feeds almost half the human population making it the single most important staple food in the world , but a meta-analysis of seven cohort studies following 350,000 people for up to 20 years , found that higher consumption of white rice was associated with a significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes , especially in asian populations . they estimated each serving per day of white rice was associated with an 11 % increase in risk of diabetes , which may help explain why the association was even strong in asia where they eat much more rice . this could explain why china has almost the same diabetes rates as we do . they have at about 10 % , we ’ re at about 11 % , despite seven times less obesity in china . japan has eight times less obesity than we do , yet may have a higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes cases than we do , nine per a thousand , compared to our eight . they ’ re skinnier and still may have more diabetes . maybe because of all the white rice they eat.just like eating whole fruit is associated with lower risk of diabetes , whereas eating fruit processed into juice may not just be neutral but actually increase diabetes risk . eating whole grains , like whole wheat bread or brown rice is associated with lower risk of diabetes , whereas eating white rice , a processed grain , may not just be neutral but actually increase diabetes risk.white rice consumption does not appear to be associated with increased risk of heart attack or stroke , though , which is a relief after this earlier study in china suggested a connection with stroke . but do we want to eat a food that ’ s just neutral regarding some of our leading causes of death , when we can eat something associated with lower risk of diabetes , heart attack , stroke , and weight gain.for example if you look at the cornell-oxford-china project , rural plant-based diets centered around rice were associated with relatively low risk of the so-called diseases of affluence , which includes diabetes . maybe asians just genetically don ’ t get the same blood sugar spike when they eat white rice ? no , if anything people of chinese ethnicity get higher blood sugar spikes.the rise in these diseases of affluence in china over the last half century has been blamed in part on the tripling of the consumption of animal source foods . the upsurge in diabetes has been most dramatic , and it ’ s mostly just happened over the last decade . that crazy 9.7 % diabetes prevalence figure that rivals ours is new — they appeared to have one of the lowest diabetes rates in the world in the year 2000.so what happened to their diets in the last 20 years or so ? oil consumption went up 20 % , pork consumption alone went up 40 % , and rice consumption dropped about 30 % . as diabetes rates were skyrocketing , while rice consumption was going down , so maybe it ’ s the animal products and junk food that are the problem . yes , brown rice is better than white rice , but to stop the mounting asian epidemic , maybe we should focus on removing the cause — the toxic western diet . that would be consistent with data showing animal protein and fat consumption associated with increased diabetes risk . but that doesn ’ t explain this.if the rise in meat consumption is to blame , then why do the biggest recent studies in japan and china associate white rice intake with diabetes ? one possibility is that animal protein is making the rice worse . if you feed people mashed white potatoes , a high glycemic food like white rice , this is how much insulin your pancreas has to pump out to keep your blood sugars in check . but what if you added some tuna fish ? tuna ’ s got no carbs , no sugar , no starch . shouldn ’ t make a difference , right ? or maybe it would even lower the mashed potato spike , by lowering the glycemic load of the whole meal , but instead you get this . twice the insulin spike . same with white flour spaghetti , and flour spaghetti with meat . the addition of animal protein makes the pancreas work twice as heard.you can do it with straight sugar water . if you do like a glucose challenge test to test for diabetes , where you drink a certain amount of sugar . this is the kind of spike in insulin you get , but if you take in the exact same amount of sugar , but with some meat added , you get this . and the more meat you add , the worse it gets . just adding a little meat to carbs doesn ’ t seem to do much , but once you get up to like a third of a chicken breast ’ s worth , you can elicit a significantly increased surge of insulin . this may help explain why those eating vegan have such low diabetes rates , because animal protein can markedly potentiate the insulin secretion triggered by carbohydrate ingestion . conventional wisdom about diabetics combining carbohydrates with protein or fat to control blood sugar had it all wrong then … just to clarify , the conventional “ wisdom ” is more concerned with reducing immediate blood sugar levels than improving insulin function . blood sugar is in fact reduced by addition of protein or fat through delayed gastric emptying and reduced intestinal motility . you can see the inverse relationship between blood glucose vs insulin response in the gulliford paper ( free access ) . unfortunately the dietary recommendations ( high fat / protein ) resulting from this focus on glycemic response only serves to reduce insulin sensitivity in the long term and i agree is “ all wrong ” .wrong b00mer just like your other posts . improving insulin function is what we call improving insulin sensitivity . that is achieved by intermittent fasting ( less insulin use ) , exercise ( burning glycogen from the system so it wants carbs ) , and minimizing carb foods ( insulin spikers ) .improving insulin sensitivity is a long-term goal but can easily be attained in the short term with the right plan of attack , and that is the 3 things i mentioned above . the only way to maintain insulin sensitivity in the long-term is to not flood your body with insulin . now if it ’ s a question of whether or not protein or carbs are a bigger contributer , then i ask you this : what has more sugar , steak or an apple . common sense would dictate the apple , and knowing that sugar has the largest response on insulin , you can ascertain that steak ( the protein / fat ) , produces a much smaller insulin response . given that , you know to maintain insulin sensitivity for the long term , more protein / fats must be eaten instead of carbs.hi b00mer , i ’ m a newbie to these things and trying to make sense of your statement . please help me understand.eating protein with rice helps to lower the blood sugar but increases insulin response . the emphasis has always been on blood sugar but if i understand this video and your comment , the emphasis should be on insulin response / sensitivity.this is kind of murky to me . i still don ’ t get it , how can there be a difference between blood sugar and insulin sensitivity ? can you point me to a resource , book , video that makes this easier to understand . pardon me if i ’ ve confused terms or sound naive . ( i am ) . i ’ m trying to get this clear in my head.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / what-causes-insulin-resistance / if it ’ s all wrong then , you have to ask yourself the question as to why it ’ s still prescribed to this day and works to the point it reverses the disease in many cases.ever heard of the term “ if it aint broke don ’ t fix it ” ? insulin and insulin resistance aren ’ t too hard to understand . once a basic grasp of it is understood , then people know why proteins are combined with carbs.as this video illustrates , the more animal protein added to a carbohydrate meal , the more insulin required . i ’ ve also seen similar studies showing that adding butter to mashed potatoes increases insulin release . since in 20 years the amount of fat in the chinese diet increased from 23.6 to 35.9 % , i would think fat as well as protein may have something to do with the rise in type 2 diabetes.i agree julie i think it has more to do with fat then protein . should we be concerned with eating rice with beans if it ’ s really the protein . i doubt itguys the protein involved here is animal derived so there ’ s no worry about combining rice & beans as beans have a significantly lower insulin spike than meat.are out there the same study but with rice and vegetable protein ? for example rice + soy beans and insulin levels. does not seem to be an expensive or invasive test to do with patients.i have better luck cutting vegetables and fruit and more meat , as my specialist recommended . i have major trouble with bloating and weight gain with rice and / or beans . because i also have a muscle disease and cant continue with all of the exercise ( yes , my body , or my legs , just shut down last fall . i needed steroids to get the moving again ) , and i am studying nutrition , i thought i would try less meat , so i have cut most of it out . im not going to lie , i get really hungry sometimes without it . i started checking my blood sugars and they remained normal for a few days . i checked before and after waking , eating anf exercise . all good . im perplexed at what might have me stalled with the weight im at . it is true that i was bit by a tick while hiking in colorado , and got “ the rash ” . almost immediately , i began gaining weight . the legs not working came months later . i though about possible lyme , but drs here don ’ t test for or treat it , they ignore it . ideas ? becky , have you seen the documentary ; “ under our skin ” about lyme disease ? quite informative and crucial to get a doctor who specializes in lyme . please consider getting a second opinion as the disease will continue to progress . best wishes.incorrect on all accounts julie . both protein and fat blunt the insulin response of carbohydrates ( though you generally do not want to consume copious amounts of fats with carbs.the amount of insulin required depends on 2 things : 1 ) just how insulin resistant your insulin receptors are on your cells 2 ) what type of carbohydrate your eating.worst case scenario is your insulin resistant and eating something that requires a large release in insulin like carb ladened foods requiring a lot of insulin released suddenly to clear out the glucose . this is why proteins are added to carb meals to slow down the the glucose conversion , thus slowing down the insulin release . proteins added to a meal do not require more insulin to be secreted.this eduvideo is the bomb ! this is going to be sent to all my colleagues so they can review this data . i can ’ t thank you enough keep up the great work.i have told you to stop surfing the internet for pictures of girls … … ; - ) just kidding ! why ?

please don ’ t allow anyone to joke about anything at anytime , anywhere . humor is forbidden . john sjohn s : “ surfing the internet for pictures of girls ” is the obvious connection . your response adds salt to the proverbial wound . when women , even politely ( note my “ i ’ m sure that wasn ’ t your intention ” and “ thanks ” ) request that men check their objectifying comments , they often receive a version of what you wrote : i.e. hey can ’ t you take a joke ?

you are correct as long as you don ’ t add any meat or oil to the rice that you ’ re eating . there is an old study that dr. mcdougall showed me about pre-diabetics and feeding them pure sugar and taking the oil and fat out of their diet and then there prediabetes went away . but when they added back the oil to the sugar prediabetes came back.interesting ! i know that we have much to learn .. any grain , even whole causes me to gain weight quickly and belly fat seems to want to “ grow ” , . jokingly , i say its like yeast ! even following myplates recommendations with more veggies makes me gain weight .. frustrated , trying , learning moreit ’ s really a no brainer that it ’ s not the rice.i mean they have known this for many decade s why do they think it ’ s going to change all of suddenbut don ’ t you need some fat to absorb the nutrients from the vegetables that you are presumably eating with the rice ? hi wegan , rice and vegetables without any nuts , oil , avocado , etc will contain some fat . rice is about 8 % fat by calorie , broccoli is 11 % fat , tomatoes are 10 % fat , etc . so a meal without the addition of very high fat foods does not mean that the meal is fat free . jeff novick responds to this idea with some number crunching in this mcdougall forum thread : https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / forums / viewtopic.php ? f = 22 & t = 5939 & hilit = jeff + tomatoes + oilfantastic reply and i appreciate it very much . cheers , have a good weekendb00mer : i have been wanting to say for a while now how amazing and helpful your replies are . you do an incredible job of explaining things simply , logically , succinctly and with hard data to back up what you are saying . i so look forward to reading your posts.this particular post , with the link to jeff ’ s comments is particularly helpful to me . it had cleared up a lot of confusion on my part . he makes so much sense ! smart guy.thea , that ’ s so kind of you ! actually having a morning where i ’ m feeling a bit overwhelmed and inadequate and your comment brought a smile to my face.p.s. happy 1st day of spring ! everything natural has some fat in it , i think . we tend to think that rice is a carb , like potatoes . but in reality , rice and potatoes are carbs , with protein and a little fat . vegetables also have fat in them.hi eddie , a couple more options for shorter cooking times : uncle ben ’ s makes a 10 minute parboiled brown rice . i haven ’ t tried it myself so i don ’ t know if the texture or flavor is comparable to regular rice or if there ’ s a significant price difference . also i use a pressure cooker to cook rice ( i happen to use an electric countertop model ) and brown rice cooks in 12 minutes . it was about a hundred bucks so it ’ s a significant investment but i use it all the time . it made such a difference to be able to come home and have rice nearly immediately instead of 45 min on stovetop or 1 h 45 min in rice cooker . stovetop pressure cookers would be quick too and can be less expensive than the electric ones.i got a programmable zojirushi rice cooker that allows you to set the time you want the rice to be ready . that lets me set it up before ieaving for work in the morning and i have brown rice ready and waiting when i walk in the door . it is also great for making steel cut oats as well . then i set it up before going to bed and wake up to hot oatmeal . i like to put a teaspoon of cinnamon and a bunch of raisins in mine and always comes out perfect . some days it never makes it back in the cabinet as immediately after putting the left over brown rice in the frig , i set it back up with oatmeal for the next morning . but it is nice to have a pressure cooker as well for those times i forget to set up the rice cooker in the morning.programmable rice cookers are great ! i actually used to have one … the problem for me was realizing i was out of rice and / or remembering to set it up in the morning . i ended up getting rid of it when i got the pressure cooker to save on cupboard space . if one has the requisite brain power : p to operate one , yes a great option ! also that oatmeal sounds fantastic . i imagine the raisins end up with that fresh out of the oven cinnamon roll style gooiness ? i ’ m off to find out if my pressure cooker has a delay function.those short cooking time rice variants are often made by increasing the water content of the rice . another possibility is to add a surfactant to get water in quicker . the former has a dramatic increase in risk of pathogens ( nasty ones live on damp rice ) and the latter wreaks havoc on your stomach . i used to drink decaffeinated instant coffee but found that the surfactants used to increase coffee extraction would give me a terrible stomach upset after 5 days of 3 cups a day . now i only drink bean coffee and haven ’ t had a single problem.by the way , basmati rice is a white long grain that is much lower gi . also recently we bought red and black long grain which has a much stronger flavour while being low gi . finally we can now by unrefined ( brown ) basmati which is better still.love the basmati rice … so very important in most indian vegan dishes , i ’ ve found ! my other go-to rice is just plain old brown rice … i think it ’ s 77 cents a pound at walmart these days ! but my preferred starch is potatoes .. i cannot deny it . ( “ that ’ s me ‘ irish ! ” … my maternal grandma was 100 % irish ) what about arsenic and cadmium in rice ? it has been reported that arsenic levels are 10 times higher in brown rice — due its accumulation in the bran and husk — when compared to white riceat this last weekend ’ s advanced study weekend , dr. john mcdougall said that the problem with arsenic in rice is not the rice per se , but in the water used to grow it and in some cases from soil affected by previous water sources ; and that california rice is ok , but rice from the southeast u.s. is not . “ … and that california rice is ok ” beg to differ . lundberg rice of california was shown to have some of the highest arsenic levels of all.was this true from the newer report ? jj gave us some links , above . i believe california rice had lower levels , compared with rice grown in texas and arkansas.i was referring to the original brand-specific cu report regarding brown rice . unsure if the follow-up retested as specifically as the original did.where can i get info on rice arsenic levels worldwide ? hi natalie. jj supplied us with a link , below , that looked at rice from different countries . i ’ ll post it , here . it is important to note that rice may not have as high levels of arsenic , compared with other foods . dr. greger has some great resources on food and arsenic . i find it valuable to know when reports like these are published that perhaps many other foods and arsenic sources are not identified . i am not saying arsenic in rice is not concerning , but perhaps other foods deserve awareness , as well.and generally indian and thai rices are also low in arsenic . i had heard that a lot of the arsenic in the rice in the se us comes from the low dose arsenic deliberately feed to chickens to make them grow faster . most of the arsenic ends up in the chicken manure which ends up on the fields or in the water . it isn ’ t that the water there is naturally high in arsenic . i wonder at the arsenic load of the people eating the chickenjim they grew cotton there for many years and used arsenic laden pesticides up until the mid 80s and now it ’ s being absorbed by the riceah , good to know , thanks . still who ever thought that feeding an incredibly toxic substance that accumulates in the animal ’ s tissue to animals used for human consumption was ever a good idea needs to be kept far far way from anything to do with food production ! and the folks at the fda who oversee food safety really need to be shown the door if this is the level of oversight they practice.plus , what isn ’ t absorbed by the chickens eventually to be eaten winds up in the manure . so not only does all the tons of manure from the billions of chickens raised each year represent a huge ecological disaster just from the naturally occurring constituents , now it really should be treated as hazardous waste . wonder if the future superfund sites will be centered around the huge broiler chicken factory farms.hi joe k. this was ( is ) a controversial topic . dr. greger ’ s video on rice and arsenic helps answer the question of “ should we eat brown rice ? ” the answer is “ yes ” – u.s. rice preferred , and there are ways to prepare ( such as rinsing ) to lower the arsenic . ” u.s. rice preferred ” … … where does he get this ? that isn ’ t what the report says.all types of rice ( except sushi and quick cooking ) with a label indicating that it ’ s from arkansas , louisiana , or texas or just from the u.s. had the highest levels of inorganic arsenic in our tests . for instance , white rices from california have 38 percent less inorganic arsenic than white rices from other parts of the country.brown rice has 80 percent more inorganic arsenic on average than white rice of the same type . arsenic accumulates in the grain ’ s outer layers , which are removed to make white rice . brown has more nutrients , though , so you shouldn ’ t switch entirely to white . brown basmati from california , india , or pakistan is the best choice ; it has about a third less inorganic arsenic than other brown rices.rice that ’ s grown organically takes up arsenic the same way conventional rice does , so don ’ t rely on organic to have less arsenic. http : / / www.consumerreports.org / cro / magazine / 2015 / 01 / how-much-arsenic-is-in-your-rice / index.htmthanks for catching that , jj ! that video was from 2009 , before both consumerreports articles . california rice was still found to be pretty low , from what i see , but you are right we cannot lump “ u.s. ” rices into one category . sorry for my mistake and thanks for keeping an eye out . please feel free to continue catching my goofs.best , josephhere is a more indepth report from november 2014.http : / / www.greenerchoices.org / pdf / cr _ fsasc _ arsenic _ analysis _ nov2014.pdfthanks ! i also failed to mention that rice may not be the only foods of concern . for more info on food and arsenic.hey eddie . sounds fine to me.do we know brown rice is better against diabetes ? at 1 : 27 of the video the chart shows brown rice .5 servings per day .87 risk , white rice one serving per day 1.23 risk . that makes it kind of hard to compare . i keep some cooked brown rice from tj ’ s in the freezer in case i forget to start it in time.eddie : b00mer listed some good ideas if you decide you want to cut down further on your white rice eating . i have another idea for super-quick brown rice – buy it already pre-cooked and frozen . i get pre-cooked , frozen brown rice from trader joes . it has nothing in it but brown rice . period . or you can get a box with a mix of brown rice , black barley and something else i think . super quick and easy to fix – zap in microwave for 3 minutes . it ’ s perfect every time.gonna try some out ! thanks ! very interesting . thanks so much for all the great work ! what about rice with a plant protein such as seitan or tofu ? good question , i was thinking the same thing ! i think i should point out that rice and potatoes are also sources of plant proteins . soy products are associated with a decrease risk in diabetes : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / soy-breast-cancer-3 / . dr.greger mentions here that soy products cuts diabetes risk in half . but in terms of the interactions between soy and animal products , i ’ m not so sureit seems that animal protein was the main reason individuals had a spike in insulin . good question though . perhaps similar to the reason why carcinogens on plants do not form at high temperature like grilling , or nitrites in fresh vegetables do not create n-nitrosamine compounds like nitrites found in meat ? but i love my basmati rice , indian food just wouldn ’ t be the same with brown . i guess the idea here is to keep it fat free or very low fat . i eat paneer ( high fat indian cheese ) once in a while with it.brown basmati is pretty tasty too ! the cause of the increased insulin spike wasn ’ t the fat in the animal foods , it was the protein . still keeping the fat low is still a really good idea , especially the amount of saturated fat . so just skip the paneer . i substitute tofu and find it an acceptable substitute for paneer since 99.9 % of the flavor comes from the curry sauce.as for brown versus white rice , it is just a matter of giving your taste a chance to adapt . i used to hate brown rice and only liked white rice . but after eating almost exclusively brown rice for several years , i can ’ t stand to eat white rice . i consider it flavorless and the only way i can eat it is if it is thoroughly saturated by a highly flavored sauce like curry.substituting tofu for paneer is a great idea , i ’ ll have to try that . i also want to find some brown basmati rice , as brad suggested , but my local stores don ’ t carry it . i ’ ll find some somewhere , sometime.you make a lot of sense . forty percent of americans will never eat a whole grain . is this still true after general mills and kellogs ’ switched to whole grain ? the minimum suggested is 48 grams . if you ate 200 grams of labeled whole grain ( four bowls of oatmeal ) a day you could live the same amount extra as if you did twenty minutes of exercise a day , ate four more walnuts a day , or smoked five less cigarettes a day according to this site . is that about five years ? i can see it is about when you get started . how long does a 10 percent reduction in diabetes shorten your life according to this site ? maybe you could balance white rice with other whole grains . eating less meat is also recommended . all in moderation.wonder bread did a whole lot of damage to americans ’ palates.so to clarify , when the animal protein or animal fat is adds to the white rice , the insulin released is more than when white rice is consumed on its own ? does this mean that in the short run , if someone is checking their sugar , it will actually be lower when animal protein / fat is added to the rice ? does it act like an insulin secretagog , like a sulfonylurea ? if you freeze the tofu first then let it thaw it really changes the texture . freezing causes most of the water to form ice crystals throughout the block of tofu . when thawed the ice melts and leaves tiny pores in the tofu . the result is very much like a sponge . also the tofu takes on a much chewer texture . when put in a marinade or sauce it almost instantly soaks it up and to a much greater degree than unfrozen tofu.i just take the tofu out of the packaging and water , wrap it in wax paper and then aluminum foil to make it vapor tight and pop it in the freezer . as soon as it is frozen , you can immediately let it thaw , but the tofu will keep for months in the freezer . i try to keep a few blocks in the freezer so i never run out . it is better to let it thaw in the refrigerator for at least a day , so the trick is remember to take it out of the freezer the day before you want to use it . if it is still a little frozen , just slice it up and then use the defrost setting on the microwave to defrost it the rest of the way . i have even completely defrosted it in the micro when i have forgotten to put it in the frig . hope you like it.i ’ ve found that i greatly prefer the taste and feel of short-grain brown rice to long-grain brown . the grains are plump and nutty and incredibly tasty with a little shoyu sprinkled on them . mmmmmm . . .dr. greger , the video showed us what was observed when animal protein was added with carbs , and the increased spike in insulin . but do we know why , i.e. , the mechanism by which animal protein exacerbates the insulin spike ? neilthere are likely multiple mechanism which causes insulin to spike ( ie type of nutrient , effect on metabolism , energy reserves , etc ) . one of them probably is that higher levels of proteins and also fat interfere with the utilization of energy.unsure why you felt the need to post what you did as it did not address my question . i was not asking about multiple mechanisms . the video was about animal protein spiking insulin , which is why i asked specifically about that subject . then your conjecture about what one of these other “ mechanisms ” may be is equally irrelevant.i don ’ t quite understand your response to someone who sounded like they were trying to be helpful . would it have addressed your question if it had been phrased : the mechanism by which animal protein exacerbates the insulin spike depends on the type of nutrient. or the mechanism by which animal protein exacerbates the insulin spike depends on metabolism. or the mechanism by which animal protein exacerbates the insulin spike depends on energy reserves. or the mechanism by which animal protein exacerbates the insulin spike depends on some combination or none of the above . ? > unsure why you felt the need to post what you did as it did not address my question . unsure why you felt the need to post a question that no one can answer to your foot-stomping satisfaction at our current level of understanding.proteins and fats don ’ t interfere with the utilization of energy , they blunt the insulin response carbs create to slow down the rise in blood sugar . this is what people generally want unless their high end athletes or cross fit gurus.i ’ m not sure what the biochemical mechanism is , but i ’ d put my money on an increase in insulin resistance as a causal factor . insulin drives a number of processes , including ferrying glucose out of the blood stream and into cells . when blood sugar increases , the pancreas bumps up its secretion of insulin in order to bump up the movement of glucose out of the blood stream and into the cells . if the cells become resistant to to the influence of insulin ( which the protein may cause ) , then the body responds by hitting it harder with more insulin.your about 95 % correct with the exception of “ protein may cause ” ask yourself this steve , what has more sugar in it ? what is going to be converted into glucose quicker ? steak or an apple ? chicken or carrots ? fish or a doughnut ? beef or a potato ? from what you typed , you seem to have a good grasp on insulin and what it ’ s purpose is . so looking at the above 3 combos , hopefully you understand that the foods that get converted to glucose quicker and thus enter the bloodstream quicker , will cause a bigger insulin response to “ ferry ” glucose out . the slower the glucose conversion , the slower the insulin response.now you have to ask yourself , how exactly does say steak , chicken , fish , beef cause a big insulin response when there is no sugar in it to convert to glucose ? it ’ s all amino acids , so if you ask yourself what causes a bigger flood of glucose in the system ; sugar or amino acids , hopefully you say “ sugar ” .knowing that , you ’ d answer your own question , protein doesn ’ t cause it , carbs do.in isolation , you comment makes sense . but the interesting and surprising finding presented in the video is that , in the presence of animal protein , the insulin response from carbs is greatly increased ( which may explain the recent increases in diabetes in china and japan , two white rice-centered cultures ) . my comment was not to propose this . the video did that . my comment was to suggest a mechanism . your comment seems to want to refute the findings in the video.your about 95 % correct with the exception of “ protein may cause ” ask yourself this steve , what has more sugar in it ?

i used this in my review paper on cancer , as a reference for putative mechanisms . interestingly , it was dr. david jenkins ( co-inventor of the glycemic index ) who brought this paper to my attention . see what you think , it ’ s a free article . i find it interesting that this paper discusses tor ( target of rapamycin ) as dr. greger touches on this , explaining how reducing intake of leucine – rich animal products such as milk may reduce cancer risk . i hope this helps.thanks , josephthere is no answer neil because adding protein to a carb meal doesn ’ t spike insulin.you first have to know why insulin is secreted , and that is in response to how much glucose is created from whatever food eaten . carb foods are more ladended with sugar and thus cause a bigger insulin response . proteins however have no sugar in them but amino acids . the aminos are what cause a release in insulin , but those have a much slower metabolizing rate than carbs.knowing this , and putting 2 and 2 together and using common sense , obviously protein does not spike insulin when eating it by itself or adding it to carbs . there is a reason why diabetics today are prescribed diets based on combining vegetables with proteins while laying off simple and complex carbs , while eating a diet high in fat . they are prescribed this because it works and reverses the disease.does plant protein have the same effect ? if you were to breakdown the animal and plant proteins into constituent amino acids of the same proportions , yes . but in general , plant proteins are less available , have a different amino acid profile and are accompanied by numerous other factors that alter metabolism.good question , emb ! i don ’ t think so . someone else asked this below . my comments , here . short answer is , no.confusing. i ’ d say eating white rice not every day is fine . i eat in between – quinoa , and brown rice . or one week white rice , the other week quinoa , then brown rice … it should be fine.i don ’ t think the message from this video is to never eat white rice . i think what you laid out sounds fine to me ! a great variety of grains , snappir.in a way , this info seems to support the old theory of food combining / “ natural hygiene ” . would like to see results with people who eschew the starches and sugars all together and eat , say , meat and non-starchy veggies.yeah , i thought of the same thing . just today i ’ ve watched very interesting and thought provoking interview with ori hofmekler , who among other things basically says that the way to increase health and longevity is to lower insulin as much as possible ( beans immediately spanng to my mind after hearing this ) , which is done , in part , by correct food combining ( or rather separation ) . i ’ m not sure about all of his ideas , but he has some very very intriguing points , https : / / youtu.be / 0eoy0a2llvq.as a minor note i quite often watch jamie oliver as a background while eating and such , so he almost every time pours like half a cup of olive oil in each of his dishes . it makes me wonder if it is indeed part of traditional ( mediterranean ) way of cooking or it is just to look cool .. : ) ) where is the graph showing a high glycemic index carb combined with a plant based protein like soy ? i expect it to be the same as the carb alone , or better but i was a bit surprised by the absence of that slide.i ’ m not sure they tested soy protein in that study , but yes it would be interesting to see . from what i gather the research overall doesn ’ t show any negative associations with soy intake and diabetes risk so it may be fair to say your expectations are valid . i too would not expect to see huge spikes in insulin from added soy.remember what tradicional eastern oriental medicine said : never mix meat ( fish ) with starches at the same meal.so did edgar cayce : http : / / www.astrodreamadvisor.com / edgar _ cayce _ alkaline _ diet.htmlhttp : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0896844611002762rice appears feminizing , not what i need right now : ( dropped eating the bulk of my energy from it , i think i ’ ll max it at 1 serving . maybe more later since females tend to age better , but for now i need a new mate first . : ) are the phytoestrogens in rice ?

you won ’ t find the truth and nothing but the truth on this site either . it simply doesn ’ t exist , nor can it ever . what hold true to one needn ’ t necessarily be true for another . that doesn ’ t mean there aren ’ t some tasty tips for the information hungry on this subject to be found there : ) comment on the site , in general he promotes low protein , high carb , low bmi , avoid alcohol , pro nuts , boron ( vegetables ) , the list of good things he recommends is pretty darn long.nothing wrong with that site , just have your info filter on while you browse it just like you should with all websites you visit , and that is including nutritionfacts , the moment you stop being your own referee you are the one that loses out.agreed , kay . i did not find the links helpful for the discussion on rice and diabetes.low testosterone / ght can have a massive impact on how a man feels and his place in the world . so when i was experimenting away with licorice for a few days trying to trigger a change in my cortisol levels , and i read on that site i was destroying my testosterone levels i was very glad to have been handed that info . rice being active in a similar way might be something to avoid as calorie mainstay for the testosterone challenged.there will be many a gentleman browsing nutritionfacts that will benefit greatly from a boost in testosterone , and will find some info on how to unlock it very helpful.very interesting ! a little meat making the food toxic.i have been waiting for this video got a while ! it delivered tenfold , but it did leave me with a question . was soy or other plant protein tested against animal protein in terms of insulin spike ? i ’ m wondering whether animal protein is specifically the cause or if total protein intake in general is the culprit . in this case , beans and rice would cause a higher insulin spike than just rice ! but i like beans . i usually add either a few black beans , kidney beans , or edamame to rice.personally i do not eat white rice or any rice very often . occasionally i like to eat brown or forbidden black rice . i ’ ve never really cared for sticky rice so the natural chew of whole-grain rice lends itself to my palette.hi selena darlim — you should check out dr. greger ’ s video ” diabetics should take their pulses . ” there ’ s a link to it in the doctor ’ s notes under today ’ s video . beans are good ! hi selena . good question ! others have asked about this , too . if interested , see my response a bit further down , or by clicking here.thank you for this mind blowing information . the more i learn the more i ’ m amazed and pleased that i stumbled upon this woe . thank you for your continued inspiration and encouragement.what about these studies showing reversal of t2d on a macrobiotic diet ?

utm _ source = refinery29 & utm _ medium = partnership & utm _ campaign = sitejust to be sure , is the good dr saying vegetable protein and / or any kind of fat ( read butter on your saffron rice ) is a-ok as far as insulin spoke is concerned ? hi saffronbutter . no i don ’ t think so . fat can still be problematic and lead to more insulin resistance.since animal protein and saturated fat or inexorably linked maybe it ’ s the saturated fat that causes the insulin spike by blocking the insulin receptor sites in the cellsyes , perhaps indeed . we know animal fat and meat consumption may be a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.if you look at the plots in the gulliford paper , you ’ ll see that from starch only to starch + tuna , there was a significant spike , and from there to starch + tuna + margarine there was not a significant increase ( even a decrease at certain time points ) .their meal descriptions are not quite clear to me in that when they state for example a meal description of “ 25 g of carbohydrate as potato ” , i can ’ t tell if they mean 25 g of potato or 25 of carbohydrate from potato ( = 35 g potato total ) . regardless of which interpretation is correct , the addition of tuna or tuna + margarine does correspond fairly well to addition of protein or protein + fat , respectively.given interpretation # 1 , each component contains : 25 g potato = 18 g carb , 1.9 g protein , 0.25 g fat 25 g tuna = 0 g carb , 6.8 g protein , 0.15 g fat 25 g margarine = 0.03 g carb , 0.03 g protein , 20 g fatgiven interpretation # 2 , different numbers but the trend remains the same : 35 g potato = 25 g carb , 2.6 g protein , 0.35 g fat 93 g tuna = 0 g carb , 25 g protein , 0.56 g fat 31 g margarine = 0.03 g carb , 0.03 g protein , 25 g fatif the small amount of fat in the tuna were playing a significant role in the rise in insulin , i think we would see a much greater increase between starch + tuna and starch + tuna + margarine.does plant protein also increase insulin production when added to rice / sugar / glucos ? hi kworden . it does not appear so . more on this below in other comments . can find here.forgive me if i missed something obvious … what is the insulin response when a similar quantity of a plant-based protein , like tofu , is added to the insulin response tests ? what about the added calorie load the digestive system is responding to with the additional calories a “ comparable ” protein source adds ( albeit vegetable ) … slightly different twist , but add protein from seitan , tempeh or nutritional yeast , even though they all contain reasonable quantities of fiber . what is the new insulin response ? is the insulin spike related to animal protein or protein ( and the additional calories ) in general ? great questions . see if you can flip thru my comments and find any helpful answers ? about the plant-based proteins , see here . unsure about calorie load , but it is interesting to me that even in studies where kcals are not monitored ( meaning diabetics could eat as many calories are they wanted from plant origin ) markers for insulin resistance still improved.you may be onto something re : fiber . we know fiber slows blood sugar spikes . not sure about what the new insulin response is ? the insulin spike in these studies ( where the graphs show insulin spike ) were due to animal protein , not plant protein.hope that helps josephi would be interested in finding out if it ’ s specifically animal protein or what we put into it that ’ s causing such a huge issue .. need a study with organic meat vs conventional meat vs no meat ! seem to be the animal protein . i made some comments throughout this thread that can be seen here , and here.this video nails it on meat and insulin . but i found out ( the hard way ) eating lots of nuts , and raising my saturated fat thereby , that my blood sugar went way up . i am vegan with only a minor ounce or two of meat every 2 weeks , so added lots of nuts to my diet . nut oils have saturated fats and this loads up muscle cells with lipids that gum up the insulin works , resulting in insulin resistance . carbs were already to the bone , so only by removing the excess nut consumption was i able to get my blood sugar down to normal over a couple of months . i eat half an ounce of walnuts now , instead of 8 ounces of nuts per day . there should be tests using nuts or oils as well as meat to give us wider knowledge of how this all works . it ’ s good news we know about meat , and probably dairy does the same thing . but nuts , and veg oils may be involved too due to their saturated fats.you should look at the videos on legumes and beans . they are a major part of my diet and they help balance my blood sugar . i eat beans at least 3 times a day , every day.hi bobluhrs , when you say “ carbs were already to the bone ” , does that mean you are following a low carb diet ? i ask because contrary to mainstream medical advice , a low fat very high carbohydrate diet is able to reverse type ii diabetes in most cases . some links exploring this dietary treatment are below if you are interested.study published by neal barnard showing successful treatment of type ii diabetes on low fat vegan diet : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2677007 / “ neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes ” : http : / / www.nealbarnard.org / books / diabetes / information from dr. mcdougall on diabetes : https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / health-science / common-health-problems / diabetes-adult-onset-and-juvenile / https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / videos / mcdougalls-moments / cure-type-2-diabetes / 2tsaybow ’ s excellent suggestions can be viewed here : “ diabetics should take their pulses ” http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / diabetics-should-take-their-pulses / “ preventing prediabetes by eating more ” http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / preventing-prediabetes-by-eating-more / dude , you ’ re not vegan ! i would like to see the experiment performed again in another lab , to see if the results are replicable , and to be completely fair to animal products , with boiled grass-fed chicken tenders and steamed wild salmon fillets.plant proteins might improve the insulin response , or it ’ s the high fiber content . see : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / beans-and-the-second-meal-effect / “ … inclusion of whole grains or legumes at breakfast decreases postprandial glycemia at lunch and / or dinner on the same day … consumption of a whole grain or lentil dinner reduces glycemia at breakfast the following morning . this effect is lost upon milling , processing , and cooking at high temperatures . the subsequent meal effect has important implications for the control of day-long blood glucose , and may be partly responsible for the reduction in diabetes incidence associated with increased whole grain and legume intake . “ hi shane , to perform such a test would require a cogent hypothesis . however the few differences in composition of grass-fed / wild animal tissue vs conventional / farmed animal tissue just don ’ t seem to warrant such a claim . if you have one or have heard a well-formed and substantiated hypothesis as to why it would make a significant difference , please share . personally i have only seen pseudoscience that disagrees with established real-world observations and claims based on the logical fallacy of argument from ignorance ( i.e. we don ’ t know for sure so it could be true ) . below is a link with general information about the grass-fed trend and diseases in ancient civilizations , as well as an excerpt from a plant positive video which is generally more philosophical but does contain a couple points on health implications of grass-fed meat.from healthy longevity : “ cardiovascular disease in ancient civilizations ” ( also briefly touches on blood sugar and diabetes ) http : / / healthylongevity.blogspot.com.au / 2013 / 10 / cardiovascular-disease-in-ancient-civilizations.html ?

( and what happens to sugar and insulin levels when the rice is mixed with a plant protein source like beans ? ) hi gnut , i am having a hard time following your question . let me know if my response helps ? from what i understand the carbohydrates alone spike insulin levels ( this is normal as we need insulin to usher glucose into cells ) when animal protein was increased , even greater spikes in insulin was seen . so yes , you are right , in this study adding animal protein to rice or potatoes increased insulin levels more than what would happen if you ate the carbohydrate alone . the study did not look at plant-based proteins , however , dr. greger has tons of videos and information within the doctor ’ s note section pointing to studies that track plant-based diets and diabetes.this place really keeps you hopping , doesn ’ t it , joseph g. ! ; - ) so our standard hamburger on a white bun is about the worst you can get.this information is a surprise to me . i would have guessed that the animal food would blunt the sugar spike.hi thankyou ( cute username ! ) , your guess is correct – addition of protein and fat does blunt the immediate sugar spike , but exacerbates the spike in insulin . these phenomena are inversely proportional . you can see plots of both in the gulliford paper ( free access : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 2679037 ) . it seems conventional medical advice has been relying on the reduction in blood sugar response as the best way to treat diabetes , however we know that this conventional treatment results in type ii diabetes being categorized as an incurable chronic disease . whereas an approach focusing on minimizing the insulin response ( i.e. low fat vegan diet ) is shown to reverse the disease.can we assume then that a non-dairy ice cream would cause less of a sugar “ crash ” than a dairy ice cream with the same amount of sugar ? interesting question . not sure at all : ) maybe not . perhaps it is something in the fiber of plant that helps slow blood sugar spikes.thank you for this great presentation dr greger ! the figures on the 03 : 55-04 : 08 and the glucose challenge with the added meat at the 04 : 24 mark had such relevance personally , as these sugar spikes are exactly what i had daily when i was consuming animal protein as well as rice a few years ago . since i ’ ve switched to the plant based whole food diet no animal protein , dairy or sugar i am able to consume white rice without the sugar-spikes but i limit it to one serving per day . the best part of all of this is the quality of life that i have now without the 11 : 00am / 2 : 00pm sugar spike and mood swings , which also came with the sense of lethargy . now my energy level is consistent throughout the day . it took about 4 -5 months to see the positive effects but it is truly worth it.hi vegank , so can you speak to what so many people are curious about on this thread regarding starch plus meat vs starch plus beans ? do you have any numbers you could share ? apologies if too intrusive . also congrats on your improved quality of life . comments like these are always my favorite.hi b00mer , unfortunately i don ’ t have any numbers . i was consuming meat / fish / chicken i usually had white rice as an accompaniment until about 2 years ago when i decided to go on a vegan diet . how i discovered that i felt much better without the animal protein / white-rice combination was by chance , i.e. when i went through an elimination process by switching first to a traditional vegan diet , followed by plant based whole food when i discovered this website 5-6 months ago . i began to replace white rice / bread / pasta with whole food eg. sweet potatoes . by this time i had a glucose meter and was able to see the positive effects in numbers . the sugar spikes accompanied by lethargy and irritability has recently disappeared almost completely . as i previously mentioned it took about 4-5 months , mainly because i was going through a learning curb but i also wonder if there is a scientific reason behind the length of time it takes . i figured that i was eating the wrong way for decades so it stands to reason that the body needs time to adjust before it can improve . the tunnel vision / slight nausea i used to feel when i became hungry also lessened down to about 1 in a scale of 10 . i think i was edging towards type 2 diabetes before i switched to the plant based whole food diet even without sugary drinks and junk food . seeing this video ( white rice & diabetes ) was not only an ah-ha ! moment but helped me to make sense of the science behind my “ before & after ” experience . having access to really good recipe books also helps to stick with it . my favorite is ” the oh she glows cook book ” and her blog , and also what is known as the shojin style cooking developed over the centuries by monks in japan who eat vegan . they use the natural taste and textures of plant based food to create appetizing yet clean food.i don ’ t usually post a lengthy comment but just thought i ’ d mention my experience so that anyone finding it difficult to get used to or see the benefit of going plant based whole food will find the motivation to persevere for a few months , until the positive changes begin to show . i had the type-2 diabetes like symptoms for 10-15 years but now i am able to manage it and have a lot of energy.so s.a.d.can any 1 help , i have hade my cholestrol checked . they said the total value was , 4,3 and it was good . but i saw some videos of the dr saying that it should be 150 mg , maybe the wrong cholestrol cheked ? ? hi soeleejmen , it sounds like you may have been given your results in mmol / l. in the us cholesterol is usually referred to in units of mg / dl . a value of 4.3 mmol / l is equivalent to about 166 mg / dl , which means you are pretty close to your goal ! calculator here : http : / / www.employees.org / ~ alokem / cholesterol.htmlwhat about eating tofu with white rice ? would tofu , as a protein and fat , increase the insulin response and increase the risk for diabetes ? does the same thing happen with non-animal proteins , such as tempeh or tofu ? also , someone below talked about oils / fats and rice . i know that many stir fry recipes use oils ( coconut , sesame etc ) , so i wonder about that too . can anyone clarify ? thanks ! interesting , but i would like to see a study confirming that this is truly an anti-synergistic effect and not merely an additional effect ( i.e. could protein raise insulin on its own without any glucose involved ? ) .hi frank , i think this video might answer your questions . between apple , oatmeal , pasta , beef , and salmon , beef and salmon had the highest and second highest insulin responses , respectively . “ paleo diets may negate benefits of exercise ” : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / paleo-diets-may-negate-benefits-of-exercise / why are your sources all over the place ? sorry , treacle234 . all of the citations can be found in “ sources cited ” it may be best to find them there . dr. greger compacted much information into one video , as he mentioned in the “ doctor ’ s note ” under the video . i suggest reading and watching those videos as well.god. this makes everything so confusing . if we eat a straight carbohydrate then our blood glucose levels spike . when blood glucose levels spike , a resulting spike of insulin pursues . if we mix the carbs with fats and protein then our blood glucose levels don ’ t spike . you would think that our blood insulin levels would not spike because our blood glucose levels didn ’ t , but this is saying that even though our sugar levels might not spike with the addition of fat and protein , out insulin levels still spike , and they actually spike even greater than if the carbs were eating alone ! this makes my head spin : ( i posted this on my facebook … i knew of protein and starches back in my 20 ’ s … let see now knew that 45 yrs ago … omg 65 … must be the good living and yes i do prepare my own meals … thanks again for this information i read years ago in “ prevention ” a monthly magazine i do believe is still in circulation … .old articles are new information to the youth of today … nutritionfact keep telling people … let food be your medicine and your medicine be your food … .does the combination at a specific meal matter … at the time of consumption ( rather than diet overall ) ?

i ’ m trying to weigh the risk / benefits . i would appreciate your input.thanks , caroline kahni love videos like this ! but what i don ’ t understand is why is data from india not used ? esp south india where i grew up has the largest vegetarian almost vegan ( no cheese or paneer consumed here , ghee , yogurt n milk are the animal products consumed here ) populations ( millions ! ) . but all my grandparents have dm2 . i lost my grandma who had to use insulin everyday to complications of dm2 and she never touched meat or was any where near it her whole life ( its a very religious thing ) . i am on this diet n i avoid all forms of animal products but i am always puzzled by this esp after i watch vids like the recent flexi tarians ( sorry exact name escapes me ) where it discusses dm2 risk lowered even if they yo-yo between eating and avoiding meat ? ? very surprising and interesting research ! i was diagnosed as being pre-diabetic 20 years ago and was told to eat protein every couple hours to avoid sugar spikes . the hospital registered dietician suggested that i eat lots of peanut butter and cheese ! ! ! to say that i never consulted that rd again is an understatement . i have been researching lately switching from an animal to a plant based diet but was concerned about my sugar levels not staying level during the day due to reduced amount of protein from legumes and nuts . could you please addres my concern ? thanksis it the fat ( from animal products ) or the animal protein that is causing the spike ? if i remember correctly i have seen a previous vid illustrating that adding fats does that ! confused.have you have seen the research on lowering the calories in rice ( http : / / www.washingtonpost.com / blogs / wonkblog / wp / 2015 / 03 / 25 / scientists-have-figured-out-a-simple-way-to-cook-rice-that-dramatically-cuts-the-calories / ) ? it seems preliminary , but would be an interesting thing to learn more about.makes total since . what i remeber studying a few years ago ( i believe in guyton and hall-physiology textbook ) amino acids stimulate insulin secretion once absorbed or entering the small intestine because insulin is required for protein synthesis and delivery into cells . so carbs plus protein double whammy on the insulin spike . now the question is … which amino acid may cause a higher spike ? since we ’ re talking about animal protein and not plant proteins , aspartate , alanine , lysine , leucine , carnitine ? let ’ s not forget growth hormone being stimulated along with insulin when we eat these proteins as well . food for thought : ) there has been some concern about elevated arsenic levels in rice . does this concern also apply to organic rice ? so another interesting angle would be to show the insulin spike pattern of eating meat alone , compared to the meat and carb shown in this video.we know that the addition of fat can cause a rise in blood sugar from the ingestion of glucose . is it clear from this study that it ’ s really the protein itself and not the fat that is making the difference ? couldn ’ t it be the fat in the animal products instead of the protein ? how do we know it ’ s the protein ? this would be for the doctor … or anyone who knows how to research this piece from the ‘ blamestream media ’ ; ) a friend recently sent me this link – an article on cutting edge science at work . it talks about cooking rice in coconut oil to cut the calories in half ! i ’ m baffled by even the suggestion that this is possible , but the article reports that … ’ science says ! ’ feedback on this much appreciated : http : / / www.washingtonpost.com / blogs / wonkblog / wp / 2015 / 03 / 25 / scientists-have-figured-out-a-simple-way-to-cook-rice-that-dramatically-cuts-the-calories / ? tid = sm _ twso whole grain pasta or brown rice are okay with some oil , right ? we ’ re just talking about the processed white stuff being bad with oil ? white rice is still okay , but brown has more nutrients and is considered a whole gain . oil is not needed , but if you insist on using a bit a little can go a long way.so what about “ eating meat alone and insulin secretion levels ” ? you have to add it there before. and you just seperate them in the moring eat meat – on midday eat rice ? one user , b00mer , mentioned this video a few threads below . it can help answer your question . thanks erthttps : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

perhaps not specifically but many studies focus on plant-based diets , which of course are full of rice and veggies / beans / etc.what about himalayan red rice ? it ’ s supposed to be very high in fiber . would that not help keep sugar count down ? probably . i have tried red rice before , but i am unsure it ’ s nutritional content . i suppose it ’ s more like brown rice , very fibrous ! black rice , brown , red , all great choices.joseph : re : ” i am unsure it ’ s nutritional content ” you might want to check out this nutritionfacts video . from the perspective of antioxidants , red rice is beats the others by a landslide ! : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / brown-rice-vs-black-rice / that was great loved it . too much shaming about cho caused hyperinsuleamia when protein based foods can be a main contributor to a greater insulin spike.coles notes : white rice is a simple carb – large insulin response brown rice is a complex carb- moderate insulin response protein foods like beef , chicken , fish – low insulin response ( no sugar to quickly convert to glucose ) combine rice with protein to slow down the insulin response.don ’ t combine rice with fats like olive oil or coconut oil or butter , even though fats blunt the insulin response . fact is , insulin still secrets and the fat has to go somewhere . insulin promotes storage so fat can and will be stored.proteins and rice ( or carbs in general ) is the golden rule to follow.the instance of diabetes has increased in asian over the past 2 decades and that ’ s because of the western diet being introduced there … mcdonalds , sugary drinks like starbucks , and pasta places.a typical asian diet only consumes small amounts of rice , very very small . small amounts of white rice will not harm a healthy person . a westernized asian diet still consumes small amounts of rice , but not may include crap from mcdonalds that ’ s inundated with carbs then washes it down with a sugar ladened vanilla latte from starbucks.many of the studies that revolved around comparing asian cultures .. compared them to ones living in asia vs the ones living in the west . turns out ( big surprise ) the ones living in the west had a much high instance of diabetes.how do we know that it is the protein consumption and not the fat ? ( the animal fat and the increased use of vegetable oils ? ) dr. douglas graham talks a lot about the link between fat consumption and insulin regulation in the 80-10-10 diet . or perhaps it is both ? thanks for any help. animal fat , animal products , animal protein , asia , cardiovascular disease , chicken , china , china study , diabetes , fat , fish , fruit , fruit juice , grains , heart disease , insulin , japan , meat , obesity , oils , pancreas health , pork , potatoes , prediabetes , rice , seafood , stroke , sugar , tuna , vegans , vegetarians protein consumption can exacerbate the insulin spike from high glycemic foods . this one is a little twisty and might require a another watch or two . instead of breaking this into multiple videos i tried to pack it all into one . basically , the question is if the modern diabetes epidemic in china and japan has been linked to white rice consumption , but how can we reconcile that with low diabetes rates just a few decades ago when they ate even more rice ? the protein exacerbation of the effect of refined carbs could help explain the remarkable results achieved by dr. kempner with a don ’ t-try-this-at-home diet composed of mostly white rice and sugar . see kempner rice diet : whipping us into shape.refined grains may also not be good for our blood pressure ( whole grains may work as well as drugs ) . what should we be eating to best decrease our risk of diabetes ? see :
PLAIN-247	how do plant-based diets fight cancer ? why do centenarians — those who live to be over a hundred years old — escape cancer ? as you can see in my 3-min. video igf-1 as one-stop cancer shop , as we get older our risk of getting and dying from cancer grows year by year until we hit about 85 or 90 , and then cancer risk starts to drop . it seems that centenarians are endowed with a particular resistance to cancer . so what ’ s their secret ? every day , 50 billion of our cells die , and every day , 50 billion new ones are born . there ’ s a balance . otherwise your body would shrink or get too crowded . sometimes we need grow , like when we ’ re a baby or for that growth spurt around puberty . our cells don ’ t get larger when we grow up ; they increase in number . a child ’ s hand may only be made up of about 50 billion cells and may have to add half trillion or so while growing up . once we ’ re all grown up , though , we don ’ t want a lot of extra cells hanging around . we still need our cells to grow and divide , but out with the old and in with the new . we don ’ t want to be making more cells than we ’ re putting out to pasture . when you ’ re a kid , extra growth can be good ; when you ’ re an adult , extra growth can mean a tumor . how do our cells know when to tip the scale in favor of more dividing with less dying and when to come back into balance ? a key signal is igf-1 , a growth hormone called insulin-like growth factor number one . igf-1 levels go up when you ’ re a kid so you grow and then come back down when you ’ re done growing . should your levels stay a bit too high as an adult , though , there ’ s a constant message sent to your cells to grow , grow , grow , divide , don ’ t die , keep going , keep growing . not surprisingly , the more igf-1 we have in our bloodstream , the higher our risk for many types of cancer . when you ’ re a kid , growth is good , but too much growth when we ’ re all grown up can mean cancer . in my 90-second video , cancer-proofing mutation , i describe laron syndrome , a type of dwarfism caused by congenital igf-1 deficiency . those affected don ’ t have that igf-1 spurt in childhood so they grow up short-statured , but not having an excess of igf-1 in their systems as an adult makes them nearly cancer-proof . this raises the question of whether one can achieve the best of both worlds by ensuring adequate igf-1 levels during childhood and then suppressing excess growth promotion in adulthood . this can be done with a plant-based diet as i described in my last blog posts cancer-proofing your body and treating an enlarged prostate with diet , as well as in my 4-min. video the answer to the pritikin puzzle . who is pritikin ? see engineering a cure . what ’ s the puzzle ? see ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay . the binding protein findings i describe in the video may explain the findings in is it the diet , the exercise , or both ? for more on igf-1 , i ’ ve touched on it before in dairy hormonal interference and meat hormones & female infertility . pingback : how do plant-based diets fight cancer ? | nutritionfacts.org | plant based nutrition | scoop.it ( ) great article ! good information . several types of plants can help prevent cancer . but i think the diet also should contain fish , and especially fat fish to be optimal , because you then get a lot of omega-3 of the best type. cancer , centenarians , dwarfism , igf-1 , insulin , nathan pritikin , tumor - -
PLAIN-2479	stool ph and colon cancer more than 30 years ago , an idea was put forward that high colonic ph promoted colorectal cancer . a high colonic ph may promote the creation of carcinogens from bile acids , a process that is inhibited once you get below a ph of about 6.5 . this is supported by data like this , showing those at higher risk for colon cancer may have a higher stool ph , and those at lower risk , a low ph . there was a dramatic difference between the two groups , with most of the high risk group over 8 , and most of the low risk group under 6.this may help explain the 50-fold lower rates of colon cancer in africa compared to america . the bacteria we have in our gut depends on what we eat . if we eat lots of fiber then we preferentially feed the fiber eating bacteria , which give us back all sorts of health promoting substances like short-chain fatty acids that have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties . more of these organic acids were found in the stools of native africans than african americans . more acids , so lower ph . whereas putrefactive bacteria eating animal protein are able to increase stool ph by producing alkaline metabolites like ammonia.the ph of the stools of white versus black children in africa was compared . children , because you can more readily sample their stools , particularly the rural black schoolchildren who were eating such high fiber diets — whole grains , legumes , nuts , vegetables , fruits and wild greens — 9 out of 10 could produce a stool on demand . stuffed from head to tail with plants they could give you a stool sample at any time , as easy as getting a urine sample . hard to even get access to the white kids , though , who were reluctant to participate in such investigations , even though they were given waxed cartons fitted with lids , and all the black kids got was a plate , and a square of paper towel.what ’ d they find ? significantly lower fecal ph in those eating the traditional rural plant-based diets , compared to those eating the traditional western diet , who were eating far fewer whole plant foods than the black children . but remove some of those whole plant foods , like switch their corn for white bread for just a few days , and their stool ph goes up , and add whole plant foods like an extra 5 to 7 servings of fruit every day , and their stool ph goes down even further , gets more acidic . makes sense , right ? what happens when you ferment plants , fruits / veggies / grains , they turn sour , like vinegars , sauerkraut , sourdough , because good bacteria like lactobacillus produce organic acids like lactic acid . and those who eat a lot of plants have more of those good bugs . so using the purple cabbage test , we want blue pee , but pink poo.no surprise , then , if you compare the fecal samples of those eating vegetarian or vegan , to those eating standard diets , plant-based diets appear to shift the makeup of the bacteria in our gut , resulting in a significantly lower stool ph , and the more plant-based the lower the ph dropped . it ’ s like a positive feedback loop . fiber-eating bacteria produce the acids to create the ph at which fiber-eating bacteria thrive while suppressing the group of less beneficial bugs.how long does it take to bring stool ph down on a plant-based diet ? as little as two weeks . a dozen volunteers carefully selected for their trustworthiness , and randomized to sequentially go on regular , vegetarian , or vegan diets and two weeks in , a significant drop in fecal ph was achieved eating completely plant-based.but there are plant-based diets and then there are plant-based diets . remember these two groups ? dramatically different stool ph yet both groups were vegetarian , but the high risk group was eating mostly refined grains , very little fiber , whereas the low risk group was eating whole grains and beans , packed with fiber for our fiber-friendly flora to munch on.just as a reduction of high serum cholesterol contributes to the avoidance of coronary heart disease , so a fall in the fecal ph value may contribute to the avoidance of bowel cancer , and through the same means , eating more whole plant foods . so if most drug absorption studies are performed on people who have alkaline poo and acidic pee , does these have an affect on vegans taking pharmaceuticals whose absorption and secretion is dependent on ph ? that ’ s a very good question and i don ’ t think anyone has every looked into this potential since vegans represent a relatively small portion of the population . 60 minutes ran a piece last year that looked at how some drug studies are only performed on men since women have “ pesky hormones ” that interfere with how the drugs react in the body . i would say it ’ s possible that the drugs react differently in vegans as well.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = w0dbnzlml4cdamn ! ! ! it was a little unsettling that the start of your video make me think of a certain basic instinct scene . i need to get out more … … .wow , vive la différence ! that is a fascinating story . allopathic medicine is in the business of developing and delivering substances and procedures to treat symptoms as one would fight a war , head on , guns a-blazing where disease is the enemy and the patient is all to often the casualty.we have certainly come a long way from let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.assuming drug companies performed such studies , they would likely suppress any negative findings : http : / / www.ted.com / talks / ben _ goldacre _ what _ doctors _ don _ t _ know _ about _ the _ drugs _ they _ prescribevery interesting , i had no idea ph played such a major roll in colon health . looks like beans & greens for the win again ! question on the swank diet . i went back to very low fat 4 days back ( < 15 % , 5-6gr sat . ) , and i seem to experience quite bad disruption in bp and maybe sugar homeostasis . i feel faint , dizzy and brain-fogged like hell , like a very bad hangover but without the stomach upset and headache . anyone have experience with this and how long this phase might persist ? would be great to know so i can plan around it.sounds a bit like hypoglycaemia to me . if you have reactive hypoglycaemia you need some fats in each meal as it slows absorption of carbohydrates . maybe you increased carbs too ? swank diet is low saturated fats but still supposed to have unsaturated fats.i would prefer my stress hormones tone down instead of slowing my absorption rate by adding fat . i ’ ve observed a noticeable change in hue of some tissues ( nails / tongue / gums ) more towards pink , which is a really good sign . those effects will be body wide so there are bound to be a few re-balancing issues . for now i ’ m not to worried about a few days of brain fog yet , i would be comforting to know though that this overshoot will re-adjust itself if given a little time . stress and a history of it appears highly involved in autoimmune disease , so the situation and question shouldn ’ t be a unusual one.try cranberry to balance the hormones and some cleansing type foods like ice berg lettuce , romaine lettuce , spagetti squash. perhaps the nut butters will give you good assess to the fats that you are eatingso i have read some information about colonoscopies . dr. mcdougal infers that https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / misc / 2010nl / aug / colon.pdf that sigmoidoscope exam is a much safer exam procedure vs most colonoscopiesjob minus the prep , mess , expence , and dangers of a perforated colon and possible issues with anaesthesia . additional i would assume risk factors decreased eating a vegan lifestyle and further decreased consuming a balanced organic diet.absolutely ! gary brown : i can ’ t thank you enough for your link to that dr. mcdougall article ! i ’ m a few years off from having to make that decision myself , but i ’ ve been starting to think about it . after reading information about mammography that i got from dr. mcdougall ( from the cochrane fondation ) , i have to wonder how many other tests are a bad idea . the article you linked to above was extremely helpful not only for helping me make my own decisions , but for giving me something i can share with my loved ones . thanks ! what if i drank a tablespoon of vinegar with every meal ? what if you ate more fiber rich whole food forms of fruits , grains and vegetables ? this is linear thinking that assumes that your alimentary canal is as inert as a garden hose and the acid in vinegar would pass unchanged through the stomach and small intestine to acidity the large bowl . as professor campbell has pointed out , we need more whole-istic thinking and focus on whole foods and even more on whole diets and less reductionist thinking on single ingredients or worse single nutrients.i so agree with this statement . “ we need more whole-istic thinking and focus on whole foods and even more on whole diets and less reductionist thinking on single ingredients or worse single nutrients . ” how does all this relate to the “ alkalize or die ” stuff we ’ ve previously been hearing for years at places like alkalizingnutrition.com ? is this another one of these 180-degree reversals that keep happening in the popular nutrition press ? bruce , we need both , alkaline blood and acid poo . and as the video points out , the exact same diet does both ! once again strong compelling evidence that evolution has set us up to eat plant and avoid animal foods.the same food is the perfect solution for all the ideals : whole plant foods cause more alkaline urine and more acidic stools . it ’ s not a 180 , it ’ s the same message . whole plant foods are an alkaline diet . and the fiber in the alkaline diet , as stated in the video , has the fiber to make the fermented results in the stools more acidic , as is desirable.please see here for dr. gregers take on alkalinity in food http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss / and in water http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-water-a-scam / i just read interesting article of women in france eat 3 eggs a day live to 115 and she say that is the secret of her longevity.looking at individual cases can be highly misleading . you have to look at populations of centenarian ’ s diets to get a more accurate representation of the diet for the “ secret of longevity ” . for example , japan a huge population of centenarian ’ s and they eat a mostly plant based diet.and how does she know that it ’ s the 3 eggs a day ? there are those that smoke cigarettes there whole life and live a very long time . this in itself is not evidence that cigarettes promote longevity . please see here for more on eggs http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ?

jmwatch the video again . that is not the message , as is stated in several of the preceding comments.i realized what you ’ re saying when i posted . i saw the preceding comments.however , we will just have to disagree on the interpretation of the science . my comment stands , at least for me.your original comment does not make any cogent points on the interpretation of the science with which to agree or disagree : “ here is an apparent argument for not taking anything that claims to alkalize your system ! ! ” what system ? we are talking about the colon and stool samples here . there are other bodily systems . the body is not one big “ system ” with one single desirable ph . “ [ … ] as so many people who are into healthy eating do every day . ” if we agree to define the “ system ” in this case as the colon / stool , then no , people who eat healthy are not creating an alkaline environment in the colon . though again , you include no indication of what “ healthy ” is – is this standard american “ healthy ” e.g. chicken , fish , greek yogurt and limited starches ? if we define a healthy diet as a diet rich in high fiber plant foods , this leads to increased acidity in the colon , whether pseudoscientific health gurus out there want to believe it or not . this is not a point up for varied interpretation . “ so many people who have been eating healthy for years still develop bowel cancer ” again , who qualifies as healthy , and where exactly is this population of healthy eaters who are developing bowel cancer at some significant rate ? all the research points to those eating a high fiber plant based diet as having lower risk of colon cancer . of course , even if eating such a diet could reduce your chances by 99 % , there will still be some who eat healthy and get colon cancer . however using that as a line of reasoning to question the results is like questioning the impact of smoking on lung cancer since there are still people who get lung cancer who don ’ t smoke . it ’ s not a productive or sensible line of reasoning.we ’ ll just have to agree to disagree.many viewing the video will agree with my thoughts . no amount of the above circumlocution or degreed names will weaken their take of common sense.peace.my entire post was based on requests for you to be more specific in regards to your own quoted statements , and yet you characterize my post as vague ? rovian projection at its finest here . there is no conversation if you don ’ t make clear , specific statements , and don ’ t respond to requests for clarification . it ’ s a shame we couldn ’ t actually discuss anything of substance , maybe next time.i love it when you talk about colon health ! groupy spotted ! : ) stop taking drugs made by big pharma ! stop drinking homogenized milk ! the animal protein gets squeezed down to nanoparticle size and absorbed into the blood stream in excess and causes inflammation which clogs the arteries.stop imagining that non-homogenized milk is magically better in all crucial ways . stop supposing that all drugs patented by large corporations are bad in all circumstances.reading these non-stop pseudo-psycho-sociopathic comments is beyond my tolerance . was it clemens who said , “ it is wrong to teach a pig to sing , it wastes your time and annoys the pig . ” cripes is there anything so ignorant as the north american peasant ?

the issue is always keeping the amount of animal protein to this level as these foods can be addictive … … .it ’ s easier to keep your taste buds adapted to a wfpb diet . what difference it would make would be towards the alkaline for poo just like the white bread and opposite to the orangeto be honest , i think this is what the traditional rural plant based diets are , ie plant based foods every day and the occasional small piece of meat on holidays / feast days . you ’ d need to look at the papers referred to in the video to see if there is a detailed food list but my understanding is that traditional rural plant based diets are not completely vegetarian . they are just very low in animal foods . the old “ sunday roast ” style of eating was similar in that basically you ate potatoes , cabbage and bread in the week but on sundays you ate some meat and fruit if you had the money . like rosemary guy says though , you ’ d need to make sure your portions are very small and infrequent . even then , a regular small serving could have consequences . as the harvard meat study found : “ one daily serving of unprocessed red meat ( about the size of a deck of cards ) was associated with a 13 % increased risk of mortality ” http : / / www.hsph.harvard.edu / news / press-releases / red-meat-consumption-linked-to-increased-risk-of-total-cardiovascular-and-cancer-mortality / now this was a daily serving but but regular meat eating every 2 or 3 days will probably also have consequences.well , all i know is i must be doing something right . i haven ’ t had a cold or the flu since the winter of 2000 . sure , there ’ s more to good heath than so-called right diet , and i could give a list of the things i do every day ( for instance , avoid docs and their deadly prescription drugs ) , but my way certainly isn ’ t the highway . everybody is different.flexitarian i ’ m calling myself now because that ’ s how i was able to be ( flex ) fruitarian a few years back . very strict 5 days , not so strict on the weekend . works great for me . i only quit that to get through the process of killing the nicotine addiction . but never could get started back . now i eat beans , greens , nuts , tea , and fruit all week long , and have some “ nasties ” on the weekend-which makes things so much simpler when dealing with the sad rest of the world . that ’ s how i encourage folks to start eating better – one meal at a time , then a day , then a week – but you never have to feel “ trapped ” if you leave some “ cheat ” days in the schedule . doesn ’ t mean you have to . more plant foods , more better-it is not an all or nothing proposition.back to what was known about ph and cancer long ago : acidosis ( an acidic cellular environment ) is unfavourable to the development of cancer cells [ 1 ] . nobel prize laureate warburg further explained a low ph makes cancer cells unable to use sugars therefore to produce energy required for their survival .

[ 1 ] the secret history of the war on cancerin this video you say , “ significantly lower fecal ph in those eating the traditional rural plant-based diets , compared to those eating the traditional western diet , who were eating far fewer whole plant foods than the black children . ” i thought the lower the ph the more acidic ( with “ 7 ” being neutral ) . i ’ m confused.neal , you ’ re right , the stool was more acidic . i didn ’ t review all of the sources cited ( see the button beside the video ) , but the few i did review correlate lower ph with more fiber in the diet and / or with lower incidence of colorectal cancer . several of the articles are full text so you might be interested to take a look at them.got it . thanks . i just confused myself in my reading of the transcript.hello , i was just googling about vermox which was prescribed for my fiancee and me to get rid of possible parasites . i was very sceptical about this drug as i don ’ t like drugs at all , but what i found is a bit shocking . accidentally i found that vermox can be used to cure cancer . here ’ s the link to the medpub : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc4096024 / # ! po = 8.43023i ’ d like to know if this could be possible that vermox can be helpful against cancer while it ’ s just lack of tests being done on humans . would be great to get any advice regarding this drug , whether it can be used as additional method to treat the cancer and even more important whether it can be used as regular precaution method to keep cancer away ? i trust my pee test results well enough ( as well as my diet ) to avoid attempting a poo test.so what about people who consume of high plant based diet as well as multiple serves of meat a day ? is the plant based component of the diet protective against rising acidity levels ? also how many grams a day are we talking about to provide some type of colon protection ? what ’ s the risk , if any , of eating too much dietary fiber foods ? ( getting too much fiber ) interesting video but it helps to dig deeper into the details . resistant starch is getting a lot of press because it is naturally in foods like beans and legumes , underripe bananas , and cooked and cooled starchy plant foods , it is fermented in the gut ( which lowers the ph ) and massively shifts the microbiota , changing the expression of hundreds of genes . the ph is only one variable in the massive shifts occurring from the fermentation of resistant starch – changes in bacteria , changes in the quantity and type of short-chain fatty acids , etc . i think you ’ re focusing on the wrong biomarker . the reduced ph is a side-effect , not a driver of the beneficial effects . # resistantstarch # metabolism acid / base balance , africa , african americans , animal protein , beans , bile acids , bowel movements , cabbage , colon cancer , colon health , fecal bacteria , fiber , fruit , grains , gut flora , ph , plant-based diets , rectal cancer , sauerkraut , standard american diet , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , vinegar fermentation of fiber in the gut may help explain the dramatic differences in colorectal cancer incidence around the world . so in the purple cabbage test we want blue pee , but pink poo . the what test ? see : testing your diet with pee & purple cabbagemore on colon cancer prevention in :
PLAIN-2489	why prevention is worth a ton of cure yes , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure , but a pound isn ’ t that heavy — why change our diet and lifestyle when we can just wait and let modern medicine fix us up ? previously , i noted that patients tend to wildly overestimate the ability of cancer screening and drugs like cholesterol lowering medications to prevent disease . so much so that if patents were told the truth about how little they ’ d benefit , 90 % said they wouldn ’ t even bother taking them.the reason we eat healthier , rather than just counting on a medical technofix , is that same over confidence may exist for treatment too . in a massive study of more than 200,000 trials , they discovered that yes , pills and procedures , can certainly help , but genuine very large effects with extensive support from substantial evidence appear to be rare in medicine and large benefits for mortality , making people live significantly longer , are almost entirely nonexistent . we 're great for broken bones and curing infections , but for chronic disease — our leading causes of death and disability , modern medicine doesn ’ t have much to offer , and in fact can sometimes do more harm than good.in my uprooting the leading causes of death talk , i noted that side-effects from prescription drugs kill an estimated 100,000 americans every year , in effect , making medical care , the sixth leading cause of death in the united states . but that ’ s just from the deaths from taking medications as prescribed . another 7,000 deaths from getting the wrong medicine by mistake , 20,000 deaths from other errors in hospitals . hospitals are dangerous places . an additional 80,000 of us die from hospital-acquired infections . more recently estimated at 99,000 deaths . but can you really blame doctors for these deaths ? you can when they don ’ t wash their hands . we ’ ve known since the 1840 ’ s that the best way to prevent hospital-acquired infections is through handwashing , yet compliance rates among healthcare workers rarely exceeds 50 % , and doctors are the worst . even in a medical intensive care unit , even if you slap up a contact precautions sign , signaling particularly high risk , less than a quarter of doctors washed their hands . many physicians greeted the horrendous mortality data due to medical error with disbelief and concern that the information would undermine public trust . but if doctors still won ’ t even wash their hands , how much trust do they deserve ? so we could go in for a simple operation and come out with a life-threatening infection , or not come out at all . and 12,000 die from surgeries that were unnecessary in the first place . for those keeping score , that ’ s 225,000 people dead from iatrogenic causes , meaning death by doctor , death by medical care . and that ’ s mostly just for patients in a hospital . in an outpatient setting , adverse effects can send millions to the hospital and result in perhaps 199,000 additional deaths . and this is not including all those just non-fatally injured , like oops , we just accidently amputated the tip of your penis . and these estimates are on the low end . the institute of medicine estimated that deaths from medical errors may kill up to 98,000 americans . that would bump us up to 284,000 dead , but even if we use the lower estimate , the medical profession constitutes the third leading cause of death in the united states . it goes heart disease , cancer , then me.one responder pointed out that it was misleading to call medicine the 3rd leading cause of death since many of those we kill also had heart disease or cancer . doctors aren ’ t out there gunning down healthy people . only people on medications are killed by medication errors of side-effects . you have to be in the hospital to be killed by a hospital error , and the most common reasons people are on drugs and in hospitals is for diseases that can be prevented with a healthy diet and lifestyle . the best way to avoid the adverse effects of medical care is to not get sick in the first place . first comment from me … : ) oh yes ! … great video as welll … very insightful ! : ) well done ! me too i was in the race ; ) the video btw , is just astonishing ! just thinking that diet and preventive medicine could save millions of people by avoiding disease which in fact will make them avoid hospital and prescriptions drug that will greatly reduce hospitals error and side effects and just by that can save another three hundred thousand people from unnecessary death – because the third cause of death is actually modern medicine – is absolutely astonishing ! big problem though , big pharma would not allow that to happen , nor big meat , dairy and eggs .. why ? because of the system that created them ! a system where short term profit is more important than human life and well being . that is in fact the real problem here .. is there solution ? yes , but will required a big revolution in our way of thinking human life on this planet .. any revolution would help right now . my husband who has been a vegan for over 35 years , was just diagnosed with bladder cancer and surrounding areas called a squamous cell cancer ! now trying the reishi fungi treatment hoping the mycelium will take out the cancer cells . the next step will possibly be a colostmy buying time for radiation to shrink the cells unless the mycelium gets there first . he has been fit , playing tennis daily , eating well , inventing a new process for making tempeh … .. for all the years that we have known about cancer and not to have a cure that can actually go after the correct one , i think there are about 200 kinds of cancer , says that there is way too much money for the drug companies to keep us healthy.an example that a vegan diet is not a promise of no disease . sorry for your husbandwe have lots of people sending good thoughts , etc . it ’ s interesting how the spiritual ends up being similar to magic , miraculous , a miracle , etc . at this point we will take all the help we can get since i think he can make a recovery from a colostmy … .. does your husband smoke ? because it is a risk facto for cancer .. also how old is he ? it will also require a change in how most americans define good health . i hope this recent experience will clearly explain my point.i was recently screened as part of a health evaluation program provided by my employer . as part of the program , participants are given a personal health score based on a health index developed by the wellness company that conducts the screening.the score is designed to help each participant understand where he / she stands for future risk of coronary artery disease ( cad ) and type ii diabetes – leading causes of premature death and disability in the us . the score is comprised of five modifiable risk factors : tobacco use , blood glucose , blood pressure , triglycerides and ldl cholesterol – all potential causes of serious health problems . the stated purpose of the health score is to help participants identify medical risks that can be improved , therefore increasing chances for a healthy future.this seems reasonable . yes ? the stated objective is for each participant to keep his / her personal health score between 0 and -20 ( the lower the score the better ) i was delighted , though not surprised , to receive a score of -20 . although it ’ s very difficult to precisely quantify individual risks for chronic disease , i initially thought that the criteria included in the health index can be expected to provide a reasonably accurate assessment of future risk for developing cad and / or type ii diabetes.however , upon further reflection , i realized that this health index has one major flaw – it does not include information on medications taken by participants.the best way to illustrate this flaw is by creating a hypothetical situation where another 54 year old guy ( john doe ) was screened on the same day as me and his screening results were identical to mine . this guy would have also received a health score of -20 . therefore , if this was a competition , he and i would have tied . this guy would have achieved his -20 score even if he was taking a gorilla dose of a statin drug , some diabetes and blood pressure medications and perhaps some other common medications , such as meds for gastroesophogeal reflux , constipation , depression etc .. therefore , he required chemical assistance to achieve the illusion of health . by definition , he cannot remotely be considered healthy . yet he would have received the highest personal health score possible.what ’ s wrong with this picture ? my thoughts : my competitior ’ s high personal health score is the result of a twisted view of what constitutes health – a view that appears to be held by the majority of americans . this shouldn ’ t be surprising as most visits to a physician usually result in the patient leaving with a prescription . if the prescription is for a drug meant to treat a chronic disease , it ’ s often a drug that the patient is told that he / she will have to take for the rest of his / her life . this fact , and the current reality of americans being constantly urged to ask their doctor about the latest miracle drug advertised on television and in magazines , has successfully created a distorted view of health in america.most americans are told that in order to be healthy , you must schedule various tests / screenings based on recommended guidelines . if these tests reveal a diagnoses of cad , cancer , or type ii diabetes , the magic carpet ride of drugs , surgeries and procedures begins . health is rarely recaptured – what results is a patient who remains sick and gets used to carrying around what eventually becomes an increasing number of medications . medications are often added to treat new symptoms created by the initial medications.is this the best we can do ? i don ’ t think so . the paradigm for preventing and treating chronic disease has to change to treating the cause of disease rather than the symptoms.the main cause of the chronic diseases that afflict americans is what they eat on a regular basis – a diet dominated with animal and highly processed foods.the paradigm of promoting people to : · transition to a whole food plant based ( wfpb ) diet · begin or maintain a reasonable exercise regimen and · avoid unhealthyhabitsis the focus of lifestyle medical doctors . as more and more physicians begin specializing in lifestyle medicine , more and more patients will be informed that they can truly recapture their health and will be encouraged to do so.i ’ m afraid this paradigm change will take a long time to occur . the medical and pharmaceutical industries that benefit from the current treatment paradigm of drugs and procedures do a masterful job at keeping the known benefits of wfpb diets from the public . the economic might of these industries is hard to fight and is the main reason the american philosophy on health is so warped.this philosophy allows a wellness company to use a health index that can conclude that john doe has the same personal health score as me . if my employer offered a monetary prize for all 50 to 54 year olds who achieve the highest possible health score , but the money came from a pool from which all perfect scorers would share , i ’ d be ticked off.luigi fontana has shared some data from a large dataset of italian patients seen by general practitioners through the national health search network . it shows that excess body weight is associated with large increases in health-care costs . the figure is here. http : / / cdn.f1000r.com.s3.amazonaws.com / manuscripts / 1232 / 4c101576-be30-43b0-97cb-f3fd52525a7b _ figure1.gifhmm interesting , maybe the threshold for being of too low a weight should be lowered as this chart shows people with bmis of 17 need some of the least medical care.this video is meaningful as i have a family member who is having aggressive treatment for a cancer all logic and statistics say she won ’ t survive . i think most of the family know this is true , but they are all riding the treatment train with her and following the doctor ’ s encouraging recommendations . after two treatments , she has been in and out of the hospital twice to treat side effects , is bald and this week is gravely ill from an immune-boosting drug . all of this is to prep her for surgery to remove the cancer . they don ’ t really know where it has spread , but will find out in surgery . before the treatments , she was in a little pain , but could go to lunch with friends . now , when not in the hospital she is in bed or laying in a recliner barely able to eat . when the disease does take her , the doctors will say how they extended her life . people accept this course of treatment as normal because they are given the hope of recovery . knowing the truth about the effectiveness and possible damage of treatments would give patients a clearer picture to make choices . .she is being “ milked ” by the surgeons , hospital and doctors for her insurance money.if you look at the surgeons fees they average about 300 dollars per hour . out of that they have an over head of over 50 % . heck my plumber makes more per hour . i think you project your poor ethics on others.yes i have very poor ethics , i am vegan atheist and proud of it . my personal experience with doctors and hospitals is extremely negative . they always prescribe the most expensive ( safest , worst case scenario ) route . they are masters of “ scaring patients ” & manipulating them into submitting their wallet . always ask for 2d , 3rd and 4th opinion . if i had submitted to their prescription i would by now have an unnecessary eye and back surgery , in poor health and bankrupt.dr. g , this is very depressing to me , as a cancer survivor of going on 14 years now . i changed my diet after reading “ the china study ” and at this point , although i ’ ve had lots of x-rays in my life , i don ’ t know what else i can do , diet-wise , although i am sure i am at risk from the x-rays.live your life to the fullest , eat a whole food plant based diet , move your body , have a positive attitude , smile and love ! forget the cancer that you have and believe me that he ( the cancer ) also will forget about you . have a nice ride ! : ) are you qualified to give out medical advice ? i ’ ll bet you ’ re tying to be helpful , but how do you know what it is this person needs to hear ? forget about the cancer may not be applicable or received from her in the same way you meant it . sorry , but i think unless you have some medical experience , and have been in the same situation you don ’ t know if you are helping or not . liisa , i can only wish you well . from what i ’ ve heard 14 years is a pretty good record.sounds more like life advice to me . medical science isn ’ t exactly batting 1000 on cures for cancer ( although promises have been made since 1971 ) . a very interesting book on attitude and belief is “ mind over medicine , ” by lissa rankin , md . this book scientifically demonstrates how the mind can positively or negatively affect medical outcomes.filipe was implying that if only we don ’ t worry about the cancer and take a variety of actions other than seeking medical treatment , then surely any cancer we have will go away . that is not well evidenced at all . that is quackery , however important a positive attitude may be to bodily health.i don ’ t think filipe ’ s post indicates that he feels we should necessarily preclude all medical treatment outright . from the book i mentioned in my previous post , it seems that the body must reside in a parasympathetic mode to heal , and not in a sympathetic or “ fight-or-flight ” mode . your state of mind has a lot to do with what mode predominates — that is , try not to worry.his post suggests that medical treatment isn ’ t necessary for a total cure of any cancer . even adding in conventional medical treatment to his list , it would still be a quackish idea . there is no good evidence of a totally curative regime for any and all cancer.and again , this is true even if it helps a great deal not to worry . saying that a “ parasympathetic mode ” is necessary to heal looks a lot like gross overstatement to me . depressed people still recover from colds , angry shouting bosses still recover from paper cuts , and so forth.depressed people also get more colds to recover from , but i do agree healing , though perhaps somewhat compromised , does de facto occur in stressed individuals . lissa rankin , md , puts it this way regarding optimal healing : “ in my medical training , we were not taught that the body knows how to heal itself . it is equipped with natural self-repair mechanisms that repair broken proteins , kill cancer cells , fight infections , prevent aging , and maintain the homeostasis of the body . when the body gets sick , whether from the common cold or something more serious , like heart disease or cancer , it ’ s almost always because the body ’ s self-repair mechanisms have broken down , usually because of stress.when the nervous system is stressed , as it is during the “ fight-or-flight ” stress response that is so commonly triggered in modern day life , these self-repair mechanisms are disabled and the body is at risk for disease . only when the counterbalancing relaxation response is activated , when the sympathetic nervous system is turned off and the parasympathetic nervous system is turned on , can the body heal itself . ” your use of the words “ implying ” and “ suggests ” regarding the intention of filipe ’ s post don ’ t of themselves constitute strong evidence for what you ’ re saying . perhaps filipe himself could expand on what he meant by his original post.the passage you quote shows the obvious dichotomous thinking that you seem to have picked up from her but have perhaps started to back away from . the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems don ’ t “ turn off ” or toggle from one to the other . both systems are active to some extent at pretty much all times . she claims that she was not taught about homeostatic mechanisms or infection-fighting processes in her medical training , which is absurd . people usually learn the beginnings of this stuff in high school.suppose i said , “ just drink water and eat balanced meals , and you ’ ll pass chemistry for sure ” . by omission , i ’ m implying that a studying well is either not necessary or important , or that the issue of studying is already settled somehow by the context so that talking about it is unimportant . in context , it actually does matter that the issue of medical treatment isn ’ t necessarily settled in the mind of either of filipe ’ s audiences : directly , the person he is addressing , and secondly , everyone involved in the public forum discussion . there actually are people who say or think that by avoiding medical care and smiling and so forth , cancer will go away.when we talk about what someone says , we often have to talk about what is implied . intentions matter , but the quality of a statement is judged by what it could reasonably imply to readers . i can recognize that there are at least a few ways in which a general audience might interpret a phrase while still pointing out that the statement very reasonably allows for a bad interpretation , and is hence a bad statement.not sure if you have read dr. rankin ’ s book ( “ mind over medicine ” ) , but the science in her book is well-referenced . her father was a hard-nosed evidence-based physician as well . but there ’ s a lot more to being or becoming well than solely the medical science aspect . and medicine ’ s success rate with cancer has been particularly dismal.if filipe doesn ’ t further elaborate on his post , then we will have to agree to disagree on our individual interpretation thereof . it ’ s just as reasonable to assume he meant avail yourself of available medical technology , but maintain a positive attitude as well , as your interpretation that he meant , “ just smile , and all will be okay . ” again , we can allow that a statement could be interpreted many ways while still claiming that it doesn ’ t do enough to exclude a relatively straightforward , bad interpretation.and again , i don ’ t dispute the importance of low stress to overall health , given that much of what plagues society at present is chronic disease . for example , systemic inflammation is good over the short term against many forms of infectious disease , but is a bad thing in the etiology of heart disease and seems to make the body more susceptible to infection if sustained over the long term . but i do dispute extreme views to the effect that the relaxation response is all that matters , which is the same reason why i don ’ t present the view that chemo and surgery is all that matters , either . we are in a video that discusses the value of taking preventive measures against disease before it gets to the point where a cure is unlikely . i agree with that general idea wholeheartedly , even if it ’ s quite unlikely that we can prevent cancer completely through lifestyle.so eating lots of fruits & vegetables is “ quackery ” , but following the medical advise is not “ quackery ” as evidenced by scientific study of # of deaths associated with hospital , doctor errors and wrong diagnostics ? not to mention intentional errors for money.no , eating fruits and vegetables is not quackery . nor is following medical advice in treating a particular form of cancer when evidence backs the treatment.saying that eating a lot of fruits and vegetables , smiling , and moving your body is guaranteed to cure any cancer is quackery , full stop . why ? because evidence doesn ’ t indicate that this would be the outcome of the treatment.yes , but a lot of medical advise and treatment is quackery ( it ’ s fraud to steal money from patients to enrich doctors and hospitals ) . a lot of evidence is quackery – like “ milk does the body good ” government propaganda and lies . at least smiling and moving your body does not damage your wallet , enrich a doctor , torture an innocent animal nor put your health at risk.which is why it should be good evidence and people should be careful about making universalizing claims.thank you filipe , great advice.hi lisa , it is true that we live in a very toxic environment . in early 1900 ’ s around 1 / 100 men were expected to develop cancer . today it is 1 / 2 in their lifetime . the body is incredibly designed and is constantly fighting off cancer , so the best thing to do is put the best quality food and supplements into it , enjoy different types of exercise weekly , cut out as much refined sugar and processed foods as possible , and take steps to boost our immune system . many great natural treatments out there for boosting immune system and i would recommend talking to doctors / more natural physicians about options . it sounds like you are doing a great job already ! there is much we can do to help our bodies so never stop learning.it definitely can be frustrating but it is important to do things that make you feel good . science is always changing and we never have direct answers otherwise we would all be living until we are 300 years old . the important thing is to eat a well-balanced diet , get plenty of sleep , drink lots of water , and exercise daily . preventing disease starts with a healthy lifestyle first ! an inconvenient truth : sdr . greger : i greatly admire your candor . the first step toward solving a problem is to admit the existence of the problem , but most doctors are so full of themselves and think they can do no wrong . if i went to a doctor , noticed that he hadn ’ t washed hands before touching me , and asked him to wash his hands , how would he react ? when my aged mother was in the hospital ( nyc 1990 ’ s ) i put a small sign on the wall above her bed which simply said “ please wash your hands first . ” someone on staff kept ripping it down.just because i ’ m paranoid doesn ’ t mean my doctor isn ’ t out to get me . i just knew i was right ! : ) whoo-hoo ! you hit the ball out of the park with this one dr. greger . thank you so much ! what a concept – prevention . don ’ t get sick in the first place . the video makes an excellent case supporting this . “ only people on medications are killed by medication errors of side-effects . you have to be in the hospital to be killed by a hospital error , and the most common reasons people are on drugs and in hospitals for diseases that can be prevented with a healthy diet and lifestyle . ” good one , dr. g. : - ) this is a really important thing to tell people . we are so used to watching these amazing tv doctor programs and dramatic shows like “ marcus welby ” or “ house ” that we have very few facts in our heads when we talk or think medicine and health care . no wonder health care is the number one cost in our country and is rising steadily even with obamacare.then lately to back that up we keep hearing about celebrities that say they have cancer and then beat it . who knows that the real truth is about this , or is it just more fakery and giving advanced extra care treatments to some to sell others on these treatments for cash.this mental attitude is killing the economy and the country . very important video.if side effects from prescription drugs are the 6th leading cause of death in the us why is that not listed in the cdc ’ s leading causes of death table ? what is the source for that astonishing number ? http : / / www.cdc.gov / nchs / fastats / leading-causes-of-death.htmsource is here . note that ’ s just in hospitalized patients . adverse effects of medical care in outpatient settings may cause an additional 199,000 deaths . read dr. starfield ’ s tragic report for all the details.why use a 2000 report in 2015 ? maybe because it ’ s the best report so far ? i think that it has been even worse since 2000 … thanks for the reference source.thanks for the link to starfield ’ s editorial . it contains excellent information but would i disagree with one comment and add an additional perspective . many authors tend to fall back on the “ factors for poor health are multifactorial and complex ” . in this physician ’ s opinion it isn ’ t even all that complicated . the science is relatively consistent … avoiding chronic disease is helped by eating a whole food plant based diet with adequate vitamin b12 intake , regular exercise , maintaining a “ normal ” body weight , not smoking and minimizing alcohol consumption . the two reports by the iom , to err is human and crossing the quality chasm showed the problems with errors in tertiary prevention ( i.e. the use of drugs and procedures ) . it is clear as others on this blog have stated that if if you maintain health where you don ’ t need drugs or procedures you can avoid these errors . if we hold the medical industry responsible not only for preventable errors but also for not giving patients the best information about preventing and reversing chronic conditions you can easily make a case for medical care being the leading cause of death in the country . a good reason to stay tuned to nutritionfacts.org for the latest in science … you never know when some new science will help you improve your health or that of a family or friend.in france , i learnt prevention when i was in medical school . respect for body care and food is included in french lifestyle , may be it is part of the so called “ french paradox ” quand je parle de prévention en france , on me renvois souvent au plaisir de la table et à la culture française . et vu le matraquage médiatique absurde et mensonger sur les risques de carences , ça risque pas de changer . heureusement que j ’ ai du sang froid et de la réparti : ) . en réalité , je suis très souvent bien

quand il y a obligation . il y a des familles francaises et americaines qui depuis des generations prennent soin de leur sante pour soigner leur image de marque , ceux qui ont des professions ou l ’

secondaires dans leurs ambitions , d ’ ou les resultats actuels.dr. greger i notice that all of the citations for this video were dated from 2000 to 2005 . does more recent research show any improvement in these trends ? i agree … the medical profession has made a tremendous push in hand care with alcohol gel at every room.cannabis oil v organic hemp seed oil for curing cancer ? ? if it was real we will know it by nowwell we can say the same thing for heart disease and a plant based diet , the fact that very few people know about it does not mean that it ’ s not true .. think about that : how many thousand of years we believed that the earth was flat ? that being said , cannabis actually possess proven cancer fighting property , indeed . but so does garlic , onion , mushroom , green leafy vegetable , beans , berrys , citrus fruits and so on .. cannabis should be in our arsenal for fighting cancer , just like everything that have a scientific basis and is proven to work ( including modern medicine of course ) , but this should not be the only one thing we do . like i said nutrition can be powerful. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = njcie9xfdggthank you for this presentation . it is extremely interesting to open new opportunities for treatment and may be for prevention . a very well balance nutrition in a healthy lifestyle is still general and accuratei fully agree with the statements of my colleague dr greger that the combination of unhealthy food with often used medications is a disaster and aggravate many afflictions on later life . so called chronic diseases of our modern lifestyle.voluntary dietary restriction will probably never gain popularity as a life extension strategy in humans . more acceptable will be a diet with less methionine . vegetable proteins – especially those from vegetables or nuts – are lower in methionine content than diets containing animal protein . several animal studies of the plant-based diets have been shown in cell growth inhibition of cancer cell cultures and extend the life span of the experimental animals healthy.when everyone is eating more and more meat … shall soon die out the chimpanzee. see also http : / / www.lastchimpanzee.comthe population explosion and the famine on earth has also led to the breeding of animals solely for consumption . genocide , the accelerated extinction of species , and ecocide , large environmental damage are the consequences.we have the technology and knowledge to support a population of a 100 billion with a lower footprint that we make today . but that would require us all getting involved in making smarter choices instead of more profitable ones , that ’ s not how the dice get rolled nowadays . we need a revolution for that , it will come , i mean its in the name right ? i disagree . the fact that humans cannot and won ’ t try to control population increases precludes any possibility that they will manage anything else of any real effect.would you ask a bacteria in a petri dish for it ’ s opinion about bacterial population growth … no … it ’ s too busy overpopulating and using up limited resources . some bacteria even have religious and political beliefs.the end result is always the same … .a crash.its pessimism , expecting huge loss of life , uncertainty of future wealth and security that has traditionally fueled population growth . populations all over the world have stabilized after reaching a certain level of health care , education and wealth . if you give people these things growth slows down to a crawl , stops or goes negative , people opt for a lower number of offspring.on the other side , famine need not exist at all . switching to growing algae and fermenting yeasts and what not , do a little tweaking here and there and you can generate an almost limitless amount of food . it requires some space but not a lot , it would allow us to hold on to the very best farmlands and return most back to nature . i do not understand why all the doom and gloom , take in even a little history and you ’ ll see there has never been a better time to live in than right now.fred is right . that ’ s called to overshoot the carrying capacity of your environment . whether you are some bacteria in a petri dish , caribous on an island , worms on a dead body or human on earth , it ’ s the same thing . it goes as follows , when energy ( resources such as food ) are plentiful , population growth is exponential until it collapse due to energy reserve being exhausted . the population graph look like a bell curve . the human population grew exponentially since we discovered fossils fuel , and today there is 10 calories of hydrocarbon in every calories you and i eat , in the industrial world . but we have passed the pic and energy resource will collapse in the not so distant future and exotic extracting method ( technology ) won ’ t change a thing ( conventional oil had already passed his pic ) , except buying us some time while polluting our environment even worse . now back to the population graph , the predicted outcome will be that the human population will severely shrink due to food scarcity . i sincerely hope that i ’ m wrong . the future is not written indeed , but the laws of the physique are ! and the human race is not on top of them . beleiving the opposite is just human arogance . soon or later though , we ’ ll need to figure it out that nature is a dictatorship not a democracy .. prosperity come from being in line with nature not fighting it. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = vomwzjrribg it ’ s not a pessimist worldview but rather a realistic one , we need to face the truth whether we like it or not .. is there solution ? short answer , yes . basically we got two choices to make , in order to keep the population level and continue to live in a high energy society ( and hence more civilized .. ) we need to switch energy production from fossils fuel towards liquid fluoride thorium reactor ( up to 10,000 years of energy available and the capacity to produce carbon neutral liquid fuel for combustion engine – renewable are not up to the challenge , they simply can ’ t replace fossils fuel and never will . period . ) , if we don ’ t , we are probably going back into the dark age , as social institution like slavery will be back to fill the void ( remember every american got hundreds of slave worth of energy thanks to fossils fuel .. ) and the second thing is to change the whole economic paradigm for a sustainable one ( good luck for that ! ) . https : / /

dietary restriction will probably never gain popularity ” – very good point . without subsidies 1 hamburger would cost > 20 $ , similar with dairy . cutting these subsidies , that make the western societies sick , would make an immediate difference.i love this webpage and i appreciate the work of dr greger very much . the idea of promoting healthy eating habits using evidence based approach is just great . thank you for this.dr greger , why focus on medical errors as causes of death , isn ’ t it a bit out of topic ? it is a complex issue and you are not able to discuss it in a 4min video . even with a perfect diet you can get sick ; would you like to be given diurectics if you come to a hospital with symptomatic left ventricular failure due to myocarditis ? probably yes , but there are no trials to confirm its efficacy . neither for this , nor for many other procedures , see http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 14684649why don ’ t you discuss , for example , the extensive literature on ginseng instead ? ; ) that article on the iatrogenic penile glans amputation was false . urology is not the primary field that practices the procedure of “ circumcision , ” it is the quack obgyn industry that illegally performs this . it is not performed commonly at all in europe , and men internationally , 85 % , are intact and living proof that it isn ’ t needed . in fact its a downright lie . it is illegal to perform an unnecessary procedure on anyone , especially minors , and “ they ” have known its unnecessary for decades . some will even admit this claiming that “ its icing on the cake , or candy in the pocket ” monetarily.the narrative focused upon seems to always end up with “ most commonly performed surgery , ” or “ practiced for thoooouuusands of yeeeears . ” so what , on both of those statements . it isn ’ t surgery because it doesn ’ t repair any deformity , or fix and / or prevent anything that can ’ t be prevented or fixed without it . i know because i ’ m an educator on this subject for 20 years and have heard the rhetoric about uti , hiv , std , “ we don ’ t like the way it looks ” bs . also , it is not commonly practiced on the scale of the world ’ s standard as 85 % of men worldwide are intact . its only common in america , and these articles always seem to mislead any american into believing that america is the only standard for male genitalia . the commonality of it in america is as a result of the ease of the insurance companies to reimburse for this fraudulent and unnecessary procedure . “ doctors ” have confessed to me that it is financial “ icing on the cake . ” but that is in fact medical abuse and fraud . “ circumcision ” is one of the unnecessary procedures that is highlighted earlier as causing death at around 200-300 annually . they go unreported in the media , and noted as other causes because the medical industry doesn ’ t want you to know that genital cutting can lead to death . and just how many deaths have to happen before its considered dangerous ? airbags killed 6 children in 1996 and the government stepped in to tell the auto industry it had to revise the device . what is wrong with this dysfunctional , twilight zone-esque picture ? the article goes on the describe that “ ‘ circumcision ’ in unprofessional hands can have major complications impacting the emotional and sexual life of patients . ” well this is true , but all “ circumcisions , ” the euphemism for genital mutilation , can and do lead to a negative impact on the emotional and sexual life of men , either conscious or unconscious . notice how i used the word “ men ” in lieu of “ patients . ” one hundred percent of them end up in some degree of damage because natural penile skin is necessary for functional and proper sex . if subtraction of meissener ’ s corpuscles , mucosa tissue , venous structure , and dartos muscle in exchange for a scar isn ’ t damage , i don ’ t know what is . losing one ’ s glans is bad , and its never reparable , but cutting the genitals of an individual under the age of consent is abhorrent especially when that child can lose his entire organ , or at least grow up and wish he ’ d been born in europe so he could have the autonomous choice as an adult for his own body.could be dangerous pushing muslims and jews into such legislation . and i ’ m not talking about the gun toting nut bags that are crying for so much attention nowadays.i ’ m talking about added peer pressure within social groups . increased indoctrination during the formative years in order to achieve greater compliance in having the procedure at the age of consent . this would have its own human toll , i would not be surprised at all if it outweighs the number you mentioned . if not in deaths than certainly in misery suffered.somehow this discussion has gone from iatrogenicity to anti-semitism . interesting.what i ’ m anti-semitic because i use the word jew ? you are joking right ? the term “ semitic ” is broad , quoting from the jewish encyclopedia : in modern times the highest criterion of kinship between nations is the possession of a common language , or languages which have a common derivation . this criterion is not infallible ; but when checked by other tests , kinship in speech is most important evidence of kinship in race . when determined by this test , the catalogue of semitic nations differs somewhat from the biblical list . it includes the north-arabians , south-arabians ( minæans , sabeans , etc . ) , the abyssinians , babylonians , assyrians , arameans ( consisting of many widely scattered tribes extending from the persian gulf to lebanon and the hauran ) , the phenicians , canaanites , and hebrews , together with the kindred of the last-named , the moabites and the edomites . the list in gen. x. classes the phenicians and canaanitcs with the hamites ; but the linguistic and historical evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of their kinship to the semites.http : / / www.jewishencyclopedia.com / articles / 13414-semitesthey are welcome to return their countries of origin and abuse all the children they want once the laws are passed to formally outlaw male genital mutilation , although technically its already illegal when reading the 14th amendment to the constitution.i so agree ! keep up the fight with all you know . as an older mom now , i made that mistake when my baby boy was born . the doctors made me feel that he had a better chance of getting cancer if kept intact … makes me sad.you have something in common with marilyn milos who had three boys who met with the doctors “ advice . ” she is one of the founders of nocirc . its unfortunate , but we can go forward with breaking the cycle of medical and religious abuse.poor nigel . i can hear your pain and suffering . circumcision is a religious and not a health practice . those doctors who tell you so are misleading you and the public . as for “ normal ” sexual functioning being affected by circumcision for boys , this is patently false . the emotional scar seems to be far deeper for those who feel it has been an assault upon an unwitting child . the physical scar is the sign , and the loss of foreskin the evidence . however feeding the emotional wound doesn ’ t allow it to heal . acceptance and surrender to the reality will promote emotional and mental health going forward . don ’ t focus on what is missing but what gratification can be had from even an uncircumcised penis . blessings of peace , love , and joy.are you assuming i have a loss or suffering ? poor pranic roger . i can hear your pain , suffering , and denial from your obvious loss . do you know who i am ? i ’ ve been re-educating on this subject for 20 years . “ circumcision ” is not a religious practice , although jews and muslims like to think this . many scandinavian and russian jews don ’ t practice genital cutting , which includes some american jews who are opting for the alternative brit shalom . their children are intact and still quite jewish . it is the cycle of sexual abuse when performed on non consenting minors because the only ones doing it are the ones with the scars . religion is not an excuse to abuse children.acceptance and surrender to the reality that in nature all boys are born intact for a reason . eighty five percent of men internationally are , as well as the majority throughout history have been , intact . this fact is living proof that this barbaric holdover from ancient superstitions is a lie , and your defence of male genital cutting is proof of your status as the minority.if you are so confident in the idea of religious justification for this act , and for the scar on your own penis , then why are you here attempting to counter me ? do you think you will have any power in convincing me otherwise ? why are you assuming i am in the minority ? why didn ’ t you simply ignore what i wrote ? it obviously hit your regret nerve.the majority of the most highly receptive nerve functions are in the prepuce tissue called meissener ’ s corpuscles . the glans is an internal organ requiring moisture to retain sensitivity , especially the coronal ridge.regardless to what you would like to believe to quell your loss , every boy has the right to grow up and experience an unedited version of maleness . considering the hundreds of deaths , and a few dismemberments , would you have liked to have lost your entire penis ? how about the ones who have died as a result of this unnecessary phenomenon ? how many before you can consider it wrong ? c ’ mon , what ’ s the magic number ? from the very first time you posted that drug side effects were the defacto 6th leading cause of death , i have been waiting for you to use the 225,000 number and say doctors are the # 3 killer . if you include those outpatient numbers , the medical profession shoots up to # 1 . going to the doctor is literally the leading cause of death in the usa . i would be interested if you could dig into the disability numbers and see if doctors are the leading cause of death and disability . i would hope that non-medical causes of disability are higher , but if the reverse is true , that would be a pretty astounding statistic to tell people about.understatement : in this video dr. greger cites the figure that 106,000 people are killed by prescription medicines taken as prescribed , “ making medical care the 6th leading cause of death … ” this is incorrect ; it makes prescription medicines the # 6 cause of death . if you add in hospital infections and doctors ’ and hospital errors thefigure is closer to 180,000 , making medical care the # 3 cause of death in the united states . ( per the book whole , articles in jama , forbes , nyt , and the cdc data if you add them up . ) this is really sobering ! did you watch the video ? from the transcript : “ [ … ] side-effects from prescription drugs kill an estimated 100,000 americans every year [ … ] another 7,000 deaths from getting the wrong medicine by mistake , 20,000 deaths from other errors in hospitals . [ .. ] an additional 80,000 of us die from hospital-acquired infections . more recently estimated at 99,000 deaths . [ … ] and 12,000 die from surgeries that were unnecessary [ … ] in an outpatient setting , adverse effects can send millions to the hospital and result in perhaps 199,000 additional deaths . [ … ] deaths from medical errors may kill up to 98,000 americans . that would bump us up to 284,000 dead , but even if we use the lower estimate , the medical profession constitutes the third leading cause of death in the united states . ” thank you dr. greger . a few years ago , after gaining a lot of weight , i had started losing with a plant based plan . i went to a new doctor to ask if i ’ m in good enough shape to exercise . i asked if he could work with me as a raw vegan which i was practicing at the time . after some discussion and orders for blood tests etc , he said that prevention is the most important thing i can do to stay away from doctors and to stay out of the hospital . he said that they will kill you . i was pretty impressed.wow , some awesome candor there by your doctor ! and yes , this is one of doc ’ s most impressive videos … ! what we * choose * to eat every day can keep us from becoming ill . i never miss an opportunity to tell someone about nutritionfacts.org if they even * mention * feeling tired all the time or aches or pains . even if only one person checks it out and then changes to healthier eating , it ’ s worth it ! first time – in medschool – i heard of nnt ( number needed to treat ) i nearly fell of my chair , especially when i heard the numbers for “ popular ” drugs against lifestyle induced diseases . 50 , 100 , 200 – meaning that you have to treat 50 or 100 or 200 and only one patient would benefit ! ! ! this was not what i expected from modern medicine … .. i bet that serious lifestyle changes works better … . from a medical point of view , the good news is that the sicker you are , the lower the nnt gets – meaning that medicial drugs are for sick people , not something you can use to correct bad lifestyle choices before you get sick . a cheeseburger and a statin drug wont help you … .does anyone know how many persons are saved by medicine is us each year ? is it possible to make such calculations ? er ’ s are useful if you ’ ve broken a limb and need a cast , cut yourself and need stitches , of course you better hope your medical professionals washed their hands and their equipment . drugs and their side effects and mis-use or accidents in administration are realities in hospitals . so like the author says : be preventative , eat better so you don ’ t get high blood pressure , diabetes , or heart disease and avoid visits to the er . sugar , gluten and salt- our three main assailants of health . and if you add meat , well that means there ’ s little hope for most of us from avoiding hospitals. atherosclerosis , smoking , and stress are killers . let ’ s focus on eating greens and fruits and mostly raw . there ’ s still hope.steve jobs tried lifestyle medicine and didn ’ t get his surgery as recommended by his doctor . look where he is now . this video is very misleading . if you compare the number of lives saved vs the number of medical errors … the doctors win by a long shot . ( there are millions of doctor encounters every month in this country ) if you all believe this video , i dare you to eat spinach the next time you are ill and not go to the emergency room . car accident .. eat cabbage . lung cancer … . eat an apple . remember that dr pritikan who started all this vegan stuff died of leukemia in his 60 ’ s . ( actually he committed suicide because of the pain of the leukemia ) i believe in a healthy lifestyle . but what are you going to do if you get a cataract … stay blind ? break a hip … . get a wheel chair for life . doctors perform complex and difficult procedures when they open you up . crap happens. most of the time everything goes well . doctors are the brightest and the best of the human race ( try to get into medical school ) and undergo 12-18 years of education and have constant continuing medical education with recertification . no other profession is as well policed and as dedicated as doctors . they are on on call day and night for emergencies . i agree with dr greger on lots of topics . everyone has a stupid moment and this is his . “ if you compare the number of lives saved vs the number of medical errors … the doctors win by a long shot . ” a point that probably needs to be made , though part of the complexity is that the cause of death can be labeled in a number of ways . when doctors fail to advocate lifestyle enough , does that lead to lives killed ? part of the issue is that you are criticizing him as if he explicitly said what he doesn ’ t actually say . he does not advocate eating spinach as an alternative to acute care or being crippled as an alternative to hip prosthesis , so your challenge is perhaps better targeted to those who believe certain comments in the comment section.acute care has probably saved my life about 2 times : once at birth and once or twice with appendicitis — though complications with an abscess after appendectomy might be attributed to the hospital , so there ’ s some give and take there . i can agree that greger is not being upfront about his position about the positive aspects of the medical system , which are legion , and that he may be choosing ambiguity so that he can appeal to an irrational anti-med constituency.that said , simply claiming that doctors are the best of the human race because it is hard to get through medical school is absurd . the content of continuing education , the qualities needed to pass the program , and the reasons driving doctors ’ behavior all matter ; how many people do you think are strongly incentivized to become specialists because of the money ? refusing to wash your hands when going from patient to patient despite obvious evidence that it can help prevent serious infections is quite reasonably an example of the lack of professional ethics that can be found within the medical profession . it doesn ’ t matter that they now do a better job of it after the introduction of more convenient alcohol gels , if indeed a little extra discomfort and meniality to the task was all that it took to make many doctors fail to keep their patients ’ interests at heart.goulligo : steve job ’ s diet did him a world of good . he lived with what is normally a very fast growing cancer for years and years . by the time doctors recommended surgery , it was already far too late . and the doctor ’ s should have known or already knew this . to learn more , check out the very interesting and powerful talk from dr. mcdougall called : why did steve jobs die ? https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 81xnvgolhayi actually agree with parts of your argument . no amount of eating healthy will grow a cast on my arm if i should break the bone . at the same time , there are very serious diseases , including cancer , for which risk can be greatly lowered by eating a healthy diet . through numerous videos , this site gives the evidence backing this idea . here ’ s a start for you : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / cancer / question … how many family visitors wash their hands before they bring the patient the mcdonald ’ s quarter pounder with cheese and a shake after their heart attack ? how about the hospital ’ s therapy dog ? ? after it licks it ’ s rear , it licks the patient . how about the visitors on the elevator picking his nose and touching the buttons ? how many people wash their hands after using the rest room ( doing number 2 ) ? i have watched over 1 / 2 the people coming out of the restroom not going near the sink . if they do wash their hands , they sprinkle some water on their hands and wipe it off . no soap for these people . maybe we all need to follow this rule including the doctors.very good point goulligo : as a nurse for 33 years , i am vigilant to remind , model and show proper handwashing : ) here is a link to an excellent article that really gets to the heart of the health crisis in this country . it relates to a topic discussed previously by dr. greger , ie. hormesis , though in this discussion the author explains how half a century of “ anhormesis ” is reversing millions of years of evolutionary adaptation.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc4267452 / here is an excerpt : “ intermittent fasting , regular exercise and consumption of dietary phytochemicals can have a major positive impact on health by bolstering adaptive cellular stress response pathways that protect against and counteract a range of major diseases . why then are these pillars of health crumbling in many industrialized countries ? unfortunately , the united states has been the major source of the epidemics of obesity , diabetes and associated chronic diseases ( cardiovascular disease , stroke , cancers , neurodegenerative disorders and others ) . compared to all other countries , the us spends more money on health care and yet has poorer outcomes ( us burden of disease collaborators , 2013 ) . most of the poor outcomes are the result of “ anhormesis ” , a lack of hormesis resulting from unchallenging diets and lifestyles . among the us states , and within large cities , there is a strong association of diet and lifestyle ( and socioeconomic status ) with the incidence of obesity , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and stroke . technological advances have greatly reduced the need for exercise in the workplace , as well as the need to walk or ride a bicycle to work . ” focusing on that last sentence , i would take it a step further . societal “ advances ” have reduced the need for the workplace , period . whereas earning a living at one time meant if you wanted to live you had to earn it , now that is no longer the case . thanks to our “ safety net ” work is optional . ssi and disability are very viable alternatives , effectively attenuating intelectual stress along with the aforementined biological stress.yes ! excellent video ! lifestyle medicine is the answer ! it is so much simpler too ! less likely of a need for complicated interventions for disease if you eat simply whole plant foods , sleep well , get regular exercise and spend time with friends and family ! prevention is better than cure ! : - ) cancer , cardiovascular disease , cholesterol , chronic diseases , hand washing , heart disease , iatrogenic , lifespan , lifestyle medicine , longevity , medical education , medical profession , medications , mortality , penis health , side effects , statins , surgery more people might be open to changing their diet and lifestyle if they knew how little modern medicine has to offer for combating chronic diseases . this is the video i mentioned about how we wildly overestimate the efficacy of pills and procedures as well : the actual benefit of diet vs. drugs.here ’ s a link to the live presentation i mentioned : uprooting the leading causes of death . that ’ s about avoiding our deadliest diseases , more than an apple a day addresses some of our most common and from table to able some of our most disabling.for more background on how scandalous our handwashing history has been , see my q & a what about semmelweis and medicine ’ s shameful handwashing history ?

PLAIN-2499	the saturated fat studies : set up to fail where did these consensus guidelines to dramatically lower saturated fat consumption come from ? from literally hundreds of metabolic ward experiments , which means you don ’ t just ask people to change their diets you essentially lock them in a room , for weeks if necessary , and have total control over their diet . you can then experimentally change their level of saturated fat however you want and see the corresponding change in their cholesterol levels . and the results are so consistent you can create an equation , the famous hegsted equation , where you can predict how much their cholesterol will go up based on how much saturated fat you give then . so if you want your ldl cholesterol to go up 50 points all you have to do is eat like 30 % of your calories saturated fat . when you plug the numbers in , the change in cholesterol shoots right up as predicted . the experiments match the predictions . you can do it at home with one of those home cholesterol testing kits , eat a stick of butter every day and watch your cholesterol climb — it ’ s not rocket science . and look at this , this was 1965 ; we ’ ve known about this for 50 years that even if you keep calorie intake the same , increases in saturated fat intake are associated with highly significant increases in ldl bad cholesterol . now your good cholesterol goes up a bit too , but that increase is smaller than the increase in bad , which would translate into increased heart disease risk.so if you feed vegetarians meat even just once a day , their cholesterol jumps nearly 20 % within a month . to prevent heart disease we need a total cholesterol under 150 , which you can see these vegetarians were , but then even just once a day with the meat and their cholesterol shot up 19 % , but the good news is that within just 2 weeks of returning to their meat-free diet their cholesterol dropped back down into the safe range . note that their hdl good cholesterol hardly moved at all , so their ratio went from low risk of heart attack to high risk in a matter of weeks with just one meat-containing meal a day . and indeed randomized clinical trials show that dietary saturated fat reduction doesn ’ t just appear to reduce cholesterol levels , but subsequent cardiovascular events like heart attacks.randomized clinical trials , controlled interventional experiments , our most robust forms of evidence — no wonder there ’ s a scientific consensus to decrease saturated fat intake . this is going to be a toughie for big cheese and chicken . you ’ ll note , though , that the y-axis here is not cholesterol , but change in cholesterol . that ’ s because everyone ’ s set-point is different . two people eating the same diet , the same amount of saturated fat , the same number of chicken nuggets a day can have very different cholesterol levels . one person can eat 10 chicken nuggets a day and have an ldl cholesterol of 90 ; another person eating 10 a day could start out with an ldl of 120 . it depends on your genes . but while our genetics may be different , our biology is the same , meaning the rise and drop in cholesterol is the same for everyone . so if both folks cut out the nuggets , the 90 might drop to 85 , whereas the 120 would drop to 115 . wherever we start , we can lower our cholesterol by eating less saturated fat , but if i just know your saturated fat intake — how many nuggets you eat , i can ’ t tell you what your starting cholesterol is . all i can say with certainty is that you eat less , your cholesterol will likely improve.but because of this extreme “ interindividual variation , ” this wide variability in baseline cholesterol levels for any given saturated fat intake , if you take a cross-section of the population , you can find no statistical correlation between saturated fat intake and cholesterol levels , because it ’ s not like everyone who eats a certain set amount of saturated fat is going to have over a certain cholesterol . so there ’ s like three ways you could study diet and cholesterol levels , controlled feeding experiments , free-living dietary change experiments , or cross-sectional observations of large populations . as we saw there is a clear and strong relationship between change in diet and change in serum cholesterol in the interventional designs , but because of that individual variability , in cross-sectional designs you can get zero correlation . in fact if you do the math that ’ s what you ’ d expect you ’ d get . in statistical parlance , one would say that a cross-sectional study doesn ’ t have the power for detecting such a relationship . thus because of that variability , these kinds of observational studies would seem an inappropriate method to study this particular relationship . so since diet and serum cholesterol have a zero correlation cross-sectionally , an observational study of the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease incidence will suffer from the same difficulties . so again , if you do the math , observational studies would unavoidably show nearly no correlation between saturated fat and heart disease . these prospective studies can be valuable for other diseases , but the appropriate design demonstrating or refuting the role of diet and coronary heart disease is a dietary change experiment . and those dietary change experiments have been down , they implicate saturated fat , hence the lower saturated guidelines from basically every major medical authority . in fact if we lower saturated fat enough , we may be able to reverse heart disease , opening up arteries without drugs , without surgery . but wait a second . let ’ s put our big cheese and chicken hat back on . observational studies would show no correlation , mathematically could show no correlation . we ’ ve known since 1979 that observational studies simply don ’ t have the power to show the relationship . bingo ! all we need now is a friendly researcher . how about ronald m. krauss ? funded by the national dairy council since 1989 , also the national cattleman ’ s beef association , as well as the atkins foundation — perfect . then you just combine together all the observational studies that don ’ t have the power to provide significant evidence and what do you know , no significant evidence was found.this 2010 meta-analysis was basically just repackaged for 2014 , using the same and similar studies . as the chair of harvard ’ s nutrition department put it , their conclusions regarding the type of fat being unimportant are seriously misleading and should be disregarded , going as far as suggesting the paper be retracted , even after the authors corrected a half dozen different errors.but it ’ s not like they falsified or fabricated data — they didn ’ t have to . they knew beforehand the limitations of observational studies , they knew they ’ d get the “ right ” result and so they published it , helping to “ neutralize the negative impact of milk and meat fat by regulators and medical professionals . ” and it ’ s working , brags the dairy industry , perceptions about saturated fat in the scientific community are changing . this is a welcome message to consumers , who may be tired of hearing what they shouldn ’ t eat . they don ’ t need to convince consumers , just confuse them . confusion may easily be misused by the food industry to promote their interests.it ’ s like that infamous tobacco industry memo that read “ doubt is our product . ” “ doubt , is our product since it ’ s the best means of competing with the body of fact that exist in the mind of the general public . ” they don ’ t have to convince the public that smoking is healthy to get people to keep consuming their products . they just need to establish a controversy . some science says its bad , some say it ’ s not bad . conflicting messages in nutrition cause people to become so frustrated and confused they may just throw their hands up in the air and eat whatever they want , which is exactly what saturated fat suppliers want , but at what cost to the public ’ s health ? this video is complicated so i ’ ll have to rewatch it to understand the details . but the implications are clear . this video is super . thanks dr. greger ! now i get it.i still don ’ t quite get it . i see why cholesterol and saturated fat don ’ t correlate , because people naturally have different starting points of cholesterol . if only 4 % of the population have hypercholestemia , why doesn ’ t saturated fat correlate with heart disease ? i think what it means is that not everyone who eats saturated fat gets heart disease because enough people have naturally low cholesterol so that eating meat and dairy may not affect them in that way . even though it ’ s the number one killer ? or is it that pretty much everyone in this country has heart disease ? ? ? i think the point is that when you are testing for significant correlation you are comparing the pattern with the noise to determine significance of the pattern . when the pattern is large compared with the noise , we say the correlation is significant . when the noise happens to be large , then it is much easier for the pattern to hide.add to this the fact that “ normal ” people are generally studied and that our population tends to have fairly homogenous behavior , the pattern gets hidden even better.this good explanation and the excellent video itself get to the truth of the matter — but how to get the average person to understand ? the message that many people have solidified in their own minds recently is that there is no correlation between dietary saturated fat and heart disease . therefore saturated fat intake doesn ’ t really matter — so why limit it if it improves the taste of food ? the mainstream media has done their part to make a real mess of nutritional science , but why do editors of scientific journals allow for the publication of such deceptive studies ? here it is : re-quoting walter willett , chair of the department of nutrition at harvard school of public health , here is the problem : this paper is bound to cause confusion . a central issue is what replaces saturated fat if someone reduces the amount of saturated fat in their diet . if it is replaced with refined starch or sugar , which are the largest sources of calories in the u.s. diet , then the risk of heart disease remains the same . however , if saturated fat is replaced with polyunsaturated fat or monounsaturated fat in the form of olive oil , nuts and probably other plant oils , we have much evidence that risk will be reduced.and the next line in that same article is : “ dr. willett emphasized that because this meta-analysis contains multiple serious errors and omissions , the study conclusions are misleading and should be disregarded . ” the art of reading … such an undervalued skill … if you had read the transcript you would have known that.so … you post a quote out of context and i catch you red handed on trying to mislead and then reply with this ? wow ! you seriously have no self respect.you can sure dish it out can ’ t you ? you don ’ t make any sense to me.worth the wait … .. this is such a powerful piece that it should absolutely be presented on something like dateline ! everyone should share this video to his many people as possible ! the confusion you referred to in the general public in regards to saturated fat is exactly what i experience every single day with my patients.i think you might mean frontline and i totally agree ! ! luckily there have already been a number of refutations of this bad research but a frontline presentation would portray the necessary touch of evil drama that is going on.i think you both mean nightline , frontline is for animal fleas , lol.ok , i trump the front , date and night ’ lines ’ and raise you 60 minutes ! : ) frontline is a series on pbs … .not just for fleas anymore ( heh-heh ) .ok , i trump the front , date and nighte ’ lines ’ and raise you 60 minutes ! : ) does anyone know if “ bitters ” are safe to ingest ? they are a popular supplement in the natural foods industry but i ’ m not sure if they can cause more harm than good . it has been told that i should consider these “ bitters ” as a drink to help with constipation and digestion.and i like today ’ s video . avoid animal products , and saturated fat in excess.if you study all the various cures for cancer – real cures – you will notice they all feature something with a bitter flavor . nature ’ s cyanide is a bitter flavor that is effective against out-of-control cell division . in the us , we eat sweet , salty , sour , but not bitter . we have an epidemic of cancer . swedish bitters are a common tonic in europe . and you don ’ t have to take bitters . you can simply eat raw seeds , nuts , greens … and you will get plenty of what you need to be healthy . bitters are everywhere … safe to ingest bitters . we americans – and brits – avoid the bitter flavor and our bodies are therefore not well-equipped to resist cancer.some people rely on the the hydroxocobalmin form of b12 to get their daily b12 . hydroxocobalamin mops of the cyanide in the body and turns it into b12 , thus ridding the body of cyanide . this might be a bad thing , according to your logic . what do you think ? i wonder how they determine such a thing – “ hydroxocobalamin mops of the cyanide in the body and turns it into b12 . ” that has to be based on an in vitro study , there are always interesting effects from manmade chemicals . what do i think ? i think mother nature knows best . first food … and if you still need supplementation , take a natural form of the vitamin , i avoid manmade chemicals / vitamins . if you listen very closely , your body will tell you what it needs and wants . also , observe animals … they are good mentors for humans . they know how to eat for their species – and they know how to lie down and let it all go after they ’ ve been stressed.i hear you , but what is your “ natural source ” of b12 ? is it possible to get a natural source on a vegan diet ? there are two things i supplement … b12 and d3 . i do not use synthetics . and yes , you can get b12 from miso , from nutritional yeast , from tempeh … probably from a lot of cultured / fermented foods.what kind of b12 supplement , methylcobalamin or the cyanocobalamin ? i do very much enjoy and appreciate your comments on this and on your other postings.hi , marty . thanks for your kind words . i use kind organics by garden of life.sure it is . pick up a carrot straight from the ground and it eat ( dirt and all ) there ’ s your b12 ( we let the animals eat dirt whilst they eat grass etc then we eat the animal therefore using them as a nutrient filter ) when we could easily get it straight from the source ( like i do because i care about animal , the planet and my health ) . you can also get b12 from nutritional yeast , non dairy milks , tempeh , spirulena , soy and coconut yoghurt.eat it * careful — spirulina contains a useless b12 analog . that ’ s not the real thing.i don ’ t consider hydroxycobalamin a “ man made ” form of b12 . it is made by bacteria http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / hydroxocobalamin , and then converted to cyanocobalamin in the production process http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / cyanocobalamin # production . but like anything , even if natural , actually treats a disease state , in this case cyanide poisoning , it can be labeled a drug by the fda . whether it work same / better / worse / than methyl- or adenosyl- probably remains to be seen.do you take in any caffeine ? think it is safe and healthy or no ? thanks.me ? i have an occasional cup of coffee , an occasional cup of green / black / white teas , and usually i prefer some sort of herbal concoction . at this moment , i ’ m drinking a “ chai ” type turmeric tea . i ’ ve been enjoying the detox dandelion tea from the “ yogi ” teas . what are your ideas about caffeine ? the better my diet , the less my cravings . and currently i must be 90 % ‘ raw ’ . : ) would you mine sharing a sample menu of what you eat on a daily basis ? i ’ m sure it changes from time to time but i do get the feeling that there a people in this community who would greatly benefit ( i know i would ) .caffeine is healthy for all but those sensitive to it or who have it close to bedtime and keeping them up . it ’ s been found to greatly reduce the risk of parkinson ’ s in those with the genetic pre-disposition . coffee of all forms reduces risk of diabetes , and those with diabetes type ii should only have decaffeinated , which helps them control blood sugar as well.tea has antioxidants , but it unfortunately is tied for first place for the highest naturally occurring fluoride content of any food . black and red have the most , green tea has almost as much , and white tea has slightly less . the other food in first place is grape products , wine , leaves , grapes , raisins , etc .. many don ’ t know this and drink way too much tea and wine.long but clear . two thumbs up ! i agree that this is the best educational video pieces i have watched on your website , dr. greger , and it will help me in discussions with “ knowledgeable ” friends and colleagues regarding the saturated fats controversy . thank you ! this video addresses saturated fat from animal foods ( meats , butter , etc . ) what about saturated fat from plants , say , from coconut oil ? i know dr. greger has videos on coconut oil , but he hasn ’ t convinced me yet that coconut oil is bad for people . to be fair , nobody has convinced me that it ’ s good , either.why not see if it is bad for you ? get a home lipid test ( or go to one of the anylabtestnow franchises ) , if you currently use co go two weeks without it , two weeks with it and then two more weeks without it ( or if not using co , 2 wks with , then without and then with again ) , and see what your ldl levels are at the beginning and end of each time period ? ( i ’ m not responsible for any cvd events during the test fyi ) david , jen , mark , daniel : can you kindly refer me to a definitive study or meta analysis that shows that high blood ldl levels , as measured by a standard home or clinical blood test , causes heart disease ? you realize how you sound , right ? i mean , can you kindly refer me to a definitive study or meta analysis that shows that high levels of smoking , as done outside with clove cigarettes , cause lung cancer ? before you asked that question , could you even have named 3 types of evidence that are thought to link high serum ldl with heart disease in the scientifically mainstream view ? dear largelytrue : had i known , i wouldn ’ t have asked . i thought this site was all about education , not people trying to impose their beliefs on others.you can ask questions , but do you understand my point ? you seem to have been assuming that there ’ s a ~ 10 page report that all scientists point to about the definitive reasons why high ldl is thought to be a significant contributer to heart disease , and your question was framed in a way that suggested that if such a report could not be produced , then surely the evidence for the connection between serum ldl and heart disease is not strong , in spite of the fact that a wide consensus of professionals are organized around managing the disease through an approach that centers in part on ldl lowering.if you are coming from a position of general ignorance about what the science says , it helps to get the lay of the land . you might want to have a look at william roberts ’ ( the presently vegan cardiologist who is editor of the american journal of cardiology ) manuscript of 20 common questions about heart disease , which aims to give the lay of the land for a more general audience : “ what evidence connects atherosclerosis to cholesterol ? the connection between cholesterol and atherosclerosis is strong ( 9 , 10 ) : atherosclerotic plaques similar to those in humans can be produced in nonhuman herbivores by feeding them large quantities of cholesterol and / or saturated fat . it is not possible to produce atherosclerotic plaques experimentally in carnivores.cholesterol is found within atherosclerotic plaques.in societies where the serum total cholesterol is 150 mg / dl , the frequency of symptomatic and fatal atherosclerosis increases as the level above 150 increases.the higher the serum total cholesterol level , and specifically the higher the serum ldl cholesterol , the greater the frequency of symptomatic atherosclerosis , the greater the frequency of fatal atherosclerosis , and the greater the quantity of plaque at necropsy.in placebo-controlled , double-blind , lipid-lowering studies of adults without symptomatic atherosclerosis , the group with lowered serum ldl cholesterol developed fewer symptomatic and fatal atherosclerotic events compared with controls.in placebo-controlled , double-blind , lipid-lowering studies of adults with previous symptomatic atherosclerosis , the group with lowered ldl cholesterol levels after the event had fewer subsequent atherosclerotic events than did the group that did not lower their cholesterol levels ( controls ) .ldl receptors were discovered in the liver by brown and goldstein , and the absence or decreased numbers of ldl receptors in patients with quite elevated serum cholesterol levels indicates a genetic defect in an occasional patient ( 3 – 5 ) . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1312295 / so that ’ s a broad range of claims for you to investigate , some of which come with ready references for further reading.please check that short video.dr esselstyn did several studies , see the autopsies results : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = b _ o4ybqpktqno one else is achieving what he does these days , as you know is able to heal terminal coronary patients just with diet , every day . : ) it ’ s not scientific , nonetheless , it ’ s rational to assume all saturated fats have the same effect , until proven otherwise . ( aside from that , isolated fats / oils of _ any _ type aren ’ t truly healthy . ) that is what i ’ m going with too . i ’ m just going to eat the fats that occur in plants , with the plant , and nothing but the plant , thank you very much.hi james : ) did you get to see this video yet ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries / if you like to follow the science , you ’ re gonna love it . cheers ! look at that coconut oil video again . as i recall , only studies funded by the coconut industry show no ldl rise with coconut oil.i would stay away from co as well . here is a study that shows in general how bad some of the popular oils are . ( source : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17174226 ) . once i stopped eating oil , i honestly did not see any difference in taste and moreover , food started to taste better , once you remove “ the glove ” from your tongue , as lindsay nixon from happy herbivore calls oils . you taste buds adjust pretty fast and go back to 100k of years of no-oil genetics that is still present in our body.saturated fat in animal products has stearic acid which keeps it from clogging arteries . clogged arteries are a product of oxidized ldl ’ s damaging artery walls . high serum ldl is only bad if much of it gets oxidized . when it ’ s not oxidized , ldl is better for the body than hdl , as a recent study showed , where they raised hdl and stroke risk went up with it so much they had to stop the testing . coconut oil , with its mct ’ s , is even safer than saturated animal fat . it doesn ’ t oxidize . oxidized unsaturated fats turn rancid , and like hydrogenated fats , can damage arteries . the calcifications are made worse with high intake of calcium supplements.well meaning people take extra calcium or large amounts of dairy , trying to get more , and it clogs arteries and actually makes bones more brittle . high vitamin d intake is also meant to do well , but it causes the blood levels of calcium to rise , also causing heart disease . it must be taken with vitamin k2 , which guides calcium from the blood to the bones where needed . there , magnesium helps it bond with bone tissue . so magnesium , k2 and d3 are what strengthen bones , not calcium supplements or even dairy . the typical diet has enough calcium in it.mark. please provide sources of those studies , those quoted and any more you might have that shows the ldl , hdl and the co , as i am interested in seeing the evidence . thanks.another awesome video . great support as always . super video to use in my statistics class ! ! ! question : i miss having the option to “ save ” this video to “ my favorites ” list . any plans to make that option available again ? the truth is that lots of people are simply waiting for an excuse to continue eating whatever they want … there was that ridiculous austrian study that came out at the beginning of last year and the whole world was on to it in no time . these industries are continually producing lies . great video , thanks.couple questions if anyone can help out . i notice in the video that the hdl levels were down in the low 30 ’ s . i ’ ve read that a vegan diet will lower hdl because of the high carb component and will also turn the type a ldl ’ s to type b. is a high hdl more important than a low ldl ? and is this true , or even important about the type a versus type b particles ? lastly , any idea what ldl-p look like for vegans ? i assume it must in the range of optimal ( i.e < 1,000 ) ? thanks in advance.when total cholesterol is over 150 , it doesn ’ t matter how low the ldl is , it ’ s simply too high a total . the real advantage of a low ldl is actually when it ’ s part of a low total . perhaps it ’ s possible to have a total below 150 and still have too-high ldl , but certainly not common.ldl / p is not a commercially reimbursable expense under most insurance plans and circumstances . ldl-c is therefore the only surrogate we have for now.that doesn ’ t answer any of my questions.hi clem . if you have high ldl and low hdl , you are at greater cvd risk than someone with high ldl and low hdl . if you have low ldl , your hdl numbers are basically irrelevant . this is because the purpose of hdl to to remove excess cholesterol in your bloodstream and return it to the liver . i had a professor in college who is an extreme whole foods vegan athlete , his total cholesterol is 65 , hdl is zero . this gave his physician great consternation ( because the blood tests say hdl should be 60 + ) , however my friend also has a phd in biochemistry with an emphasis on human physiology . he explained that his hdl was zero because his body didn ’ t have any excess cholesterol floating around that it needed to scoop up and transport back.so the truth is , if your total is under 150 , it doesn ’ t matter what your hdl is . all the big emphasis you hear about high hdl is based on the idea that “ normal people ” have a cholesterol of ~ 200 , give or take , and for them ( way over that 150 point ) high hdl is more important . for example if your hdl is 80 and your total is 230 , that ’ s better than having hdl 30 , total cholesterol 200.i hope that helpsrkngl : that story about your professor is really interesting . thanks for taking the time to write all that out . i learned something . : - ) thanks for the informative reply , much appreciated.the videos will not show on my computer . what do i need to do ? all i get is a black screen with nothing to click to start a video.check this link https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 2ftoy6jqxm8thanks , this link works great , but how do i look at any of nutritionfacts videos ? anyone else having this problem ? just a reload of the page will usually fix that problem.yeah , me too . part one video would not play either.the link zoermoos provided works.yes , starting a few weeks ago , i cannot play the videos . thank god for the transcripts.maybe it ’ s ‘ java ’ you have to install. https : / / www.java.com / en / you can verify on the site if it ’ s already installed.may help if people update flash and flush your cache . please let me know if those help ! if that doesn ’ t help , what operating systems and versions of browsers are people using who are still having problems ? you did a video recently on sweet potatoes , how the undigested protein from the sweet potato is beneficial for some people . i have autoimmune issues and have been told to stay away from any food that has protein that does not digest completely , as this protein might get into blood and others areas in a form that causes harm or triggers more issues . do you feel that this un-digested protein in sweet potatoes could be a cause for someone staying away from these ? sounds like that this undigested protein is good the reason you highlighted , but bad for others ? i do not tolerate sweet potatoes well ( swollen glands within day ) but would like to add small amounts from time to time with hope my body will adjust . thank you.i ’ m using an older version of chrome on this computer ( perhaps the reason for the no-play ) . i ’ m having no problem on my mac.try installing google chrome from http : / / www.google.com / chrome / fred pollack did a remarkable evaluation of the chowdhury meta-analysis for the mcdougall newsletter : part 1 , part 2 , part 3 , supplement . remarkably few ( 2-3 / 20 ) of the included studies had both enough dietary diversity to adequately test sfa guidelines , and avoided overcorrecting for blood cholesterol , believed to mediate much of the atherogenic effect of high dietary saturated fat.travis at healthy longevity went still further , correcting a systematic error in the siri-tarino paper and recalculating the metaanalysis.those were great , but way too complicated for the general public to understand . heck , pollack ’ s treatment was too detailed for me , an informed consumer , to use myself much less explain to others.dr. greger puts it in a nutshell . take a bunch of studies that don ’ t have the power to determine causality and then truthfully yet misleadingly publish that no causality is determined . voilà ! time mag cover article.macsmiley – great summary of a brilliant video that deserves awards for public service and teaching excellence.saturated fat has a high correlation with animal protein consumption ( about 90 % ) . dr colin campbell believes the problem isn ’ t sat fat , but the animal protein causing damage to the arterial endothelium , or associated tmao . i still don ’ t feel like we ’ ve gotten to the bottom of this issue ? are vegetable sources of sat fat , like olive oil ok ? of course , processed oils and fats contain a lot of calories and few nutrients , so are not healthy regardless of their direct effects on arteries.and why don ’ t population studies have the resolution to discern changes in sat fat consumption affecting serum cholesterol ? does practically the entire population eat enough sat fat to saturate their serum cholesterol levels ? i think that is better to stick to whole sources of food , so e.g. use little oil and enjoy whole olives instead , avoid “ refined ” juices for whole juices ( with all the part of fruits / vegetables ) .while for your questions about resolution , i have not enough experience to give an answer , but i think that if you look into the article cited by dr greger http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 313701 you could understand better the issue , or search a biostatistic , it ’ s part of their job.skeptic that is an interesting question whether all the increase in the risk of atherosclerosis is mediated through cholesterol . in my experience intake of animal proteins may play a bigger role.for last seven years i have followed cimt results in patients with pre-existing chd . i have had some of these patients with ldl-c levels as low as 50 with statins but see no regression in plaque as long as patients do not make life style changes to reduce red meat and dairy intake . also in my own case being statin intolerant my ldl-c is still 140 on 99 % vegan diet but cimt continue to show regression . my artery age is 45 at my age of 64.an interesting post g-man . hardly surprising that chd patients who don ’ t reduce red meat and dairy don ’ t regress . curious what your full cholesterol profile is ; total , hdl and ldl … and do you know your omega 6 : omega 3 fatty acid ratio . what level of thickening and narrowing are you talking about and what constitutes regression ? d.r. before i became vegan my total cholesterol was 345 with ldl-c of 236 . on vegan diet total cholesterol is 245 with ldl-c 135.my initial cimt showed thickness at .682 and three years later it was .608mm. my hdl was 48-52 before i started regular exercise of walking on treadmill 4-5 days a week now it is 70 . i never checked omega6 : omega 3 ratio.since i never had any plaque regression is decrease in cim thickness.in conversation with drs esselstyn , campbell they almost dismiss the significance of high ldl genetic variants . you obviously have a specific profile and i have wondered what the reduction potential is for this type through diet and exercise . thanks for sharing . i myself am on the other end of the spectrum and have never recorded above 148 total , and a vegan diet has dropped it to 113 . available genetic research suggests my profile leads to a typically lower ldl than average . while tc campbell maintains > 150 is an indicator of greater disease risk , thankfully there are exceptions as i am sure you ’ ll agree.d.r. i agree.i became vegan after reading china study by campbell.based upon my clinical experience it is difficult to dismiss high ldl and i still use statins to lower ldl but it is difficult to establish cause and effect relation to cholesterol.it may be just a marker of bad diet and life style.i wonder what role epigenetics plays in high ldl aetiology , either in your patients or your own.d.r. most of my patients like me have familial hyperlipidemia . so epigenetics does not play any role . mixed hyperlipidemia on the other hand is associated with obesity perhaps epigenetics plays some role in that.the problem of course is that primary hyperlipidemias are no more than 4 % of the population and what is regarded as the acceptable level of cholesterol for the rest is way too high . many in the 96 % are being told they have a familial trait ( unqualified ) and are ready to take statins while continuing to thickly butter both sides of their bread ! over and out.d.r. you are absolutely right but the problem is patients refuse to change their lifestyle and diet therefore prescribing statins becomes necessary to help them.i appreciated your post and story . it is a dilemma for clinicians counseling patients who are eating a whole food plant based diet with no added oils and limited fruit intake who still find their ldl ’ s above recommended . we need studies on this population to decide if statins or other measures are beneficial . at this point without the studies it is a bit of a guesstimate . it is also nice to see the sharing of your improved arterial wall thickness and the time frames involved . congratulations on your improved diet and lowered risk status and best of luck with your health.don forrestor md thank you for your post.you are right that we have no studies on people who are vegans and still have high ldl . in my limited experience i find diet is most important component for lowering atherosclerosis.unfortunately i find that some of physicians i work with comment like “ who wants to live to be vegan ” they therefore do not even counsel patients about diet.here ’ s a link to dr campbell ’ s article ; he thinks its the animal protein , and that sat fat and cholesterol are basically just markers of high animal protein consumption-essentially lipids correlate with dyslipidemia but aren ’ t casual.http : / / nutritionstudies.org / fallacious-faulty-foolish-discussion-about-saturated-fat / skeptic , dr. campbell states there is high correlation with both fats ( particularly saturated fats ) as well as animal proteins in promoting a host of problems , including atherosclerosis and tumor inititation / promotion . he has stated this numerous times during all his lectures i attended . these lectures were at conferences and may not be readily available online . specifically , he stated there is no safe level of saturated fat intake below which there is no risk for the plethora of disease conditions to occur . the body of research cited is expansive . “ saturated fat , mostly found in animal-based foods , is not and should never have been considered the chief cause of heart disease and certain cancers ( the same is true for the dietary lipid , cholesterol ) . ” dr colin campbellhttp : / / nutritionstudies.org / fallacious-faulty-foolish-discussion-about-saturated-fat / campbell seems to flaunt his own ignorance in that article : “ very simply , i am not aware of any serious evidence on function , which suggests that dietary saturated fat or cholesterol are causes of heart disease or cancer . ” serious evidence on function which suggest that dietary cholesterol is a cause of elevated serum ldl ? yes , for instance the work on the ldl receptor by brown and goldstein . not easy to miss.serious evidence on function which suggests that elevated serum ldl is a cause of heart disease ? yes . the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is an ongoing topic of research , and ldl concentrations are a factor : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 2044253methinks campbell is a bit too enamored with his animal protein idea.that citation discusses the role of ldl in atherogenesis , but really doesn ’ t establish causality . ldl is always present to some extent , but what advances the lesion cascade for some people and not others ? what could make the lesion cascade advance faster for some people and not others ? ldl concentration . the concentration of the atherogenic particles modulates the rate at which they infliltrate the artery wall . it ’ s basic chemistry that all else being equal , higher concentrations lead to higher rates of infiltration , and that higher rates of infiltration would increase the equilibrium level of cholesterol particles in the arterial wall , no ? when these concentrations are greater they will tend to drive the lesion cascade at a greater rate , all else being equal . is there some special property of high ldl concentrations which discourages oxidation within the intima and / or macrophage recruitment ? it feels almost as if you have entirely missed references to functional evidence of a causal role for serum / intimal ldl concentration to play , at each step of their attempt to describe the atherosclerotic process . look at : 1. the second paragraph in “ initial events … ” 2. the part beginning in the left column of page i-5 with the words “ the scavenger receptor pathway was initially identified functionally by goldstein et al ” , as well as the last paragraph of that section3. the second paragraph of “ the fatty streak ” up to the bottom of the page , together with the third paragraph of that section4. the second paragraph of “ lesion progression ” the 2 meta-analysis studies that dr. greger refers to are the siri-tarino et al one in 2010 , and the chowdhury et al one in 2014 – right click on “ sources cited ” to the right of greger ’ s video to get links to these . the 2014 study used 20 observational studies , the 2010 one used 16 of these 20.both studies effectively said that the current guidelines on saturated fatty acid ( sfa ) intake ( < 10 % of calories from sfa ) were not justified by the evidence and should be reconsidered.these results surprised me since it went counter to all the research that i had previously read . thus , back in march 2014 , i decided to read and analyze all 20 of the studies cited by the 2014 paper . and , write it up.my overview article was part of dr. john mcdougall ’ s may newsletter that went online june 1 : http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / misc / 2014nl / may / 140500.htmthe details are in my supplement ( 100 + pages ) . my overview article provides the big-picture view and summary of my findings , and there is a link there to the supplement for download ( in case you need something to fall asleep to ) , or https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / misc / 2014nl / may / chowdhurysupp.pdf. there is one section for each of the 20 studies . plus , there is one additional section on finland ( begins on page 20 ) . the finnish story was fascinating . here are the main points of it : in 1973 , finland had the highest country death rate for men from chd . by 2007 , the chd death rate for men dropped by 80 % – 3 / 4 due to a reduction in risk factors . the decrease in serum cholesterol was 2 / 3 of that reduction . saturated fat ( sfa ) intake went from 22 % of dietary energy intake to 13 % . from 1965 to 2005 , butter consumption fell from 40lbs to 7lbs per person per year.i was shocked how bad all 20 of the studies were . in a few of the papers that i analyzed very deeply , i found evidence that the authors omitted important relevant information from their papers that would have changed the key findings ( jacc [ japan ] and kihd [ finland ] , specifically ) . it is unlikely that these were mere oversights . i was also surprised that the peer reviewers of these papers did not pick up on this.wow , thanks fred for the link to your thorough dissection of all these studies . i appreciate the time and effort this must have taken . a very interesting and eye-opening read ! pure review is not what it used to be , fred . recently cambridge press couldn ’ t even get the proofreading done properly on denicolantonio ’ s most recent outing ! fred : you rock ! thanks for taking the time to do the work – and to post here to help us too ! much appreciated.thank you fred for this amazing contribution ! it doesn ’ t take much confusion for most people to “ throw up their hands and eat whatever they want ” . people _ seek out _ whatever “ facts ” they can find that allow their dietary habits to remain unchanged.maybe so , but for me personally it was the confusion caused by conflicting “ science ” . i put it in the “ too hard ” basket . nothing made sense . that ’ s because i had degrees in “ food science ” and biochemistry . along with hard science , i got a full load of received wisdom from the special interests that control the $ flow . so everything was simultaneously true and false . good and bad.we can look to lay blame . i blame our inner apes . that monkey who cant pull his hand out of the cookie jar because he just cant bring himself to drop a few cookies . if we can constrain the human drive toward irrational self-interest we win.greger did you see this article by katan et al ( 2010 ) ? the authors pinpointed krauss for not disclosing his dairy connections. http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 92 / 2 / 459.2.fullhowever , its worth pointing out that despite the limitations inherent in diet-heart epidemiology , as stamler ( 2010 ) calculated , the rr for sfa and fatal chd was 1.32 based on 11 prospective cohorts studies . for example , in honolulu heart study sfa was statistically significantly correlated with mi and chd death , yet the association with sfa to chd got diluted when softer end points such angioplasty and chest pain were taken into account . the krauss team used an rr of 0,86 for the study indicating that sfa protects from chd : ) the very authors of honolulu themselves stated : “ when interpreting these results about whether the nutrients relate differently to the different manifestations of coronary heart disease , one should keep several problems in mind . the diagnostic certainty of the soft end points ( angina pectoris or coronary insufficiency ) is much less than that of the hard end points ( myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death ) .this could result in attenuation of a true relationship ” .i ’ ve seen a regression analysis published in a major medical journal ( can ’ t find it right now ) that shows a hyperbolic vice linear relationship between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol . people like vegans who eat almost no cholesterol and then eat even a small amount , experience large increases in serum cholesterol . people who regularly eat substantial amounts of cholesterol and then reduce it a little , experience essentially no serum reduction . the characteristic curve is essentially flat ( top of the hyperbola ) once a normal level of dietary cholesterol consumption is maintained , so incremental increases or decreases have almost no effect on serum levels , giving the impression dietary consumption levels don ’ t matter . perhaps this also occurs with sat fat ? dr. mercola claims saturated fats are good , not sure which to believe.http : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2014 / 05 / 06 / saturated-fat-phobia.aspxdr. mercola is not highly esteemed in the evidence / science-based medical community nor by the fda . he has been cited several times for making illegal claims.i don ’ t really trust the fda as i have heard many things about them , and believe they are more bothered about protecting companies like monsanto than peoples health.i think you ’ re confusing the fda with the usda ? possibly , as i actually am not from the us , im from uki sympathize with your distrust of the fda . how about a collection of harvard nutrition researchers ? mercola cites both the siri-tarino ( 2010 ) and chowdhury ( 2014 ) meta-analysis . the harvard researchers ( drs. walter willett , frank hu , frank sacks , dariush mozaffarian ) were so upset with the chowdhury paper that held a teach-in last may ( http : / / www.hsph.harvard.edu / nutritionsource / 2014 / 05 / 15 / saturated-or-not-does-type-of-fat-matter / ) . from that weblink , you can download the powerpoint foils from each of these 4 doctors . for a quick summary of their views in chart form , see 3rd slide of frank hu . also , from the 1997 nurses health study paper ( by frank hu et al , http : / / www.nejm.org / doi / full / 10.1056 / nejm199711203372102 ) , “ replacing 5 percent of energy from saturated fat with energy from unsaturated fats was associated with a 42 percent lower risk ( 95 percent confidence interval , 23 to 56 percent ; p = 0.001 ) . ” your first link is broken.try this … http : / / www.hsph.harvard.edu / nutritionsource / 2014 / 05 / 15 / saturated-or-not-does-type-of-fat-matter / yeah , that works . editing your original link so that there is a space between the address and the ‘ ) ’ would do the trick.then let ’ s just go with dr. mercola has been discredited by every reputable source.true but that doesn ’ t make dr. mercola ( the beef seller on internet ) worth trusting .. http : / / shop.mercola.com / catalog / organic-meats , 55,0,0.htmwho to believe ? easy ! just pick the one that have no conflict of interest .. i see that he ’ s still trotting out the ancel keys cherry-picking charge . reminds me of this … http : / / thescienceofnutrition.wordpress.com / 2014 / 04 / 21 / fat-in-the-diet-and-mortality-from-heart-disease-a-plagiaristic-note / whos trolling me or mercola ? that link has too much writing not gonna look lolthe referenced blog post is a bit long , but let me make it easier for you . skip the intro . start with the “ the facts ” and read just 10 para ’ s , which describes how gary taubes misrepresented ancel keys ’ research . following that is how a long list of “ low-carb ” / paleo diet folk “ copied ” gary taubes ’ mistake . you can skip all that , until you get to the mercola part.ill have a look when i get some spare time . so just so im understanding correctly , you guys are agreeing that saturated fats are bad and this article from the science foundation is explaining how people like mercola are wrong for claiming its good ? yes , saturated fats are bad . the referenced blog post is by a guy named seth , who has an ms in nutritional sciences . it only makes one point : gary taubes misrepresented the pioneering work by ancel keys on diet , and that several low-carb / paleo folk ( including mercola ) effectively copied taubes . if mercola had actually read the ancel keys research and the y & h research , he would have known not to repeat the mistakes that taubes has made.and , well before seth , plantpositive made the same points as seth . the best the source ( with detailed references ) to debunking the low-carb / paleo diet folk is http : / / www.plantpositive.com.hmm , will defo hav a look when i get a chance . i ’ ve been trying to look and diet and health in terms of evolution , as it only makes sense our bodies will have adapted to what we have been eating for thousands of years . so thinking of it like that , straight away i would say anything not natural or organic is bad for you ( harmful chemicals , additives , preservatives ) , also things like aspartame , pesticides , fluoridated water etc.so that aside i would have thought animal fat would be good for us as humans have been eating animals for a while , and as hunters i can imagine they would eat nearly everything of the animal , organs , meat etc and possibly make bone broth out of the bones . so if sat fat is actually bad for us then that means our bodies haven ’ t adapted to use it well.i know we need high veg and decent amount of fruit and nuts in our diet as well as omega 3 via fish oil . but getting conflicting theories about how your calories should be split up , currently im under the impression that fat high ( not trans fats , vegeatable oils , margarine , soy oils etc instead replace with cocounut / fish / nut oils and butter ) , protein moderate , carbs moderate ( low sugar and wheat ) .i know im going a bit off topic but interested what you guys think about what ive mentioned ? just another vote of confidence for seth yoder and his well-qualified blog . his most recent post truly underscore the dishonest lchf propagandism by “ investigative ” journalist nina teicholz and lchf proponent adele hite . once you read about the games with words they ’ re playing , you ’ ll start to recognize others doing likewise elsewhere.speaking of nina teicholz , i was shocked to find that one of my senior level college classes had her book listed as “ required ” reading . the instructor had been brain washed by gary taubes and the whole low carb bandwagon came with class lectures . it was a difficult semester to say the least.vomitrocious ! ! which university has such monstrosities as part of their curriculum ? taubes has a brother in academia . the number of professionals he and his entourage has persuaded is astounding . even skeptic michael shermer has suspended his disbelief.https : / / twitter.com / michaelshermer / status / 484796381660336129wow oh wow . i ’ m glad you survived . that would indeed be very , very tough.nrostaie : your understanding of a healthy diet is not supported by the evidence . if you have some more time to check out the videos on this site , i would recommend it . you might want to start with the summary videos : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / from-table-to-able / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death / here is what a healthy diet looks like based on the available evidence : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / butter and fish ( or fish oil ) are not part of the recommendations.when i menioned fish oil i meant in the form of krill oil . and also if we don ’ t consume butter then where do we get our vitamin k2 ? i had a quick look for vitamin b12 i was under the impression organ meats would be the choice , like liver ? nrostaie : i ’ m sorry it took me so long to respond to this . i ’ ve been wanting to respond for days.your question about k2 was interesting since i haven ’ t seen anyone ask about that before . i went to my trusty reference for specific nutrient questions , “ becoming vegan express edition ” by brenda davis and vesanto melina . these are two extremely knowledgeable ( about the science ) ladies who care very deeply about people getting the nutrients they need to be healthy , including meeting rdas ( recommended daily allowance ) .i don ’ t have time to type out the entire section on vitamin k , but this bit was too interesting not to share : “ if you follow popular lay health gurus on the internet , you may wonder if you need supplemental vitamin k2 , since little of this form is present in a vegan diet . at this time , there is no scientific evidence to suggest that vegans need to worry about supplementing with vitamin k2 . ” what the push for vitamin k2 reminds me of is other stories where out of the blue , with no scientific backing , certain “ experts ” start proclaim some national crises due to some “ deficiency ” in the people that is simply untrue . i think dr. greger ( and / or was it plant positive ? ) has a video on this topic regarding some other substance . it simply defies common sense to tell people that humans need butter ( part of the breast milk of another species ) to be healthy.i ’ m not saying that other forms of vitamin k aren ’ t important . k is very important , including for healthy bones . but here are some healthy / safe foods to get your vitamin k from : 1.5 cups raw spinach or 1 / 2 cup raw or cooked kale . according to the book i mentioned above , “ leafy greens are vitamin k superstars ” . the book includes some nice tables , including a big list of foods and how much nutrients are in them – including a whole column for vitamin k. the book is worth checking out.thanks for the response . leafy greens do have vitamin k but thats k1 which isn ’ t for bones , its more for helping with blood clotting etc although the body does convert vitamin k1 to k2 , but i think its a tiny amount.i ’ m sure vitamin k2 is beneficial for majority of the public to supplement with . i have checked reviews of vitamin k2 products with people mention it took there bone pains away , solved teeth problems and many more . if you require scientific backing here is one of the best sites i ’ ve come across as it is all based on scientific articles , all cited.http : / / examine.com / supplements / vitamin + k / # howtotakenrostaie : you referred me to that website before in a different post . after i found that other post again , it was the next one i was going to reply to . i ’ ll just reply here instead : in the video on this page , i think dr. greger did an excellent job of explaining how just because a study is published , that doesn ’ t mean that the study means anything / has any valid information to share with us . when i looked at the site you referred me to , it seems that they have fallen for just the type of study that dr. greger has been warning us about for years . the types of studies that are fatally flawed.my bottom line is : being able to back up one ’ s claims with studies is the first level to legitimacy . but that is only the first level . the second level that is equally important , is being able to understand and evaluate studies based on the body of evidence . that ’ s where a lot of sites fail.if k2 were really important for bone health , there would be a whole lot of whole plant food based eaters , those who have been eating healthy for years or decades now , who have bone problems . they just aren ’ t . brenda davis , one of the authors of that book i mentioned , gets all her vitamin k from dark leafy greens , has been doing so for decades , and has some of the densest bones the tech had seen at her last test . that ’ s just an anecdote , but my understanding is that bigger studies have shown that vegans who get enough calcium ( at least 500 mg a day ) have no problems with bone fractures . i just don ’ t think its true that * dietary * k2 is some big need . at least not for those people skipping the organ meats . ; - ) ok thanks i ’ ll keep that in mind , as yes i am aware that some studies will be distorted , since there funding source may want them to find something specific. e.g cereal companies funding experiments and only shining light on any positive they see.another thing i was curious about , i may have asked already . what do you think should be the distribution between the macro nutrients ? mainstream nutritionists and the nhs here in the uk will advise high carbs , med protein , low fat approx 70 / 20 / 10 i believe . on the other hand some nutritionists like dr mercola advise high fat , low protein , moderate carbs ( mainly from veg ) probably something like 65 / 15 / 20.i do realise that a lot of nutrients like vit a , d , e , k are all fat soluble and so they need to come with a fat source to be properly absorbed but not sure how much fat is needed.your input will be greatly appreciated thanksnrostaie : i follow a set of experts who generally don ’ t care too much about percentages of macro nutrients , with the possible exception of fat . the experts i follow generally feel that if you just focus on eating all of the right kinds of foods , then you will naturally end up getting the percentages that are good for you – especially of carbs and protein.for examples , here are dr. greger ’ s recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / and here are pcrm ’ s recommendations : http : / / www.pcrm.org / health / diets / pplate / power-plate bottom line : stick to * whole * plant foods in about the proportions pcrm recommends ( with b12 supplement ) and you get not only what you need , but a diet that is optimum for long term health / disease prevention . it ’ s very simple ! now having said that , i do have some additional information concerning the various macro nutrients and percentages . several experts have been able to reverse ( in clinical , published trials ) some serious diseases like t2 diabetes and heart disease with a low fat diet . low fat is typically defined as being around 10 to 15 % . those fat soluble nutrients that you mentioned need only a very small amount of fat to get into the body . a few nuts or seeds on a raw salad does the trick . so , that 10 % does nothing to hurt your body ’ s ability to get the nutrients it needs . on top of a whole plant food diet , add a couple tablespoons of ground flax seed to your diet and 1-2 ounces of say walnuts , and i hear from others that that gets them right in the range for a healthy fat % as long as they leave out cooking oils ( and of course , animal products and other junk foods ) .to put the fat question into perspective : my country , america , is dealing with a whole lot of overweight people . so , focusing on diets that are less calorie dense ( generally whole plant foods without oils or high fat content ) makes a lot of sense . while i don ’ t know if science has determined for sure that say a diet that is 20 % fat is harmful in general ( if it comes from whole plant foods ) , we do know that the more fat people take in over a certain percentage , the harder it is to have a healthy weight ( for many people ) .for an even better perspective on fat , consider this : one of the longest lived and healthiest populations on the planet are the traditional okinawans . their diet was about 6 % fat . that ’ s it.i ’ ll talk about protein and carbs in a separate post.nrostaie : to address your question about the best percentages for protein and carbs , i would start by addressing protein . here are the resources that i consider to be hugely helpful in understanding protein needs . these are basic primers that i think everyone should have “ under their belts ” : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.html … > and > dr. mcdougall article from december 2003. http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / newsletter / archives / you might also check out the january 2004 newsletter article , protein overload.those traditional okinawans i told you about had about 9 % protein . but to drive home the point i was trying to get at earlier , they weren ’ t interested in eating a protein percentage . they simply ate the right foods in general . it just turns out that their percentages boiled down to about 9 % . ( i ’ ve seen other quotes of 12-15 % for protein for the traditional okinawans . so , the 9 number may not be exact . but you get the idea of the range involved . ) — — — — — — — – if the traditional okinawans were eating 6 % fat and 9 % protein , then the rest would be carbs at 85 % .my big “ beef ” ( or should i say “ banana ” ? ) with people talking about carb percents is that they are lumping table sugar and flour products with whole foods like steamed broccoli ( which also has protein , etc . ) and beans . it ’ s a big problem because the nutrition labels on products say , “ carbs ” without any distinction between what might be healthy and what is not.so , if i were going to suggest to someone that they eat say 75 % “ carbs ” ( i ’ m basically pulling that number out of thin air ) , i would be severely misleading them . because cookies and cake have a lot of carbs in them.which leads us back to my original point . if every day you eat whole ( and largely intact ) plant foods so that volume-wise over the course of a day , you get about : 1 / 4 beans / legumes , 1 / 4 grains , 1 / 4 veggies , 1 / 4 fruits ( including lots of berries ) , 1-2 ounces of nuts and seeds ( including 1-2 tablespoons ground flaxseed ) and vitamin b12 , then you naturally get the percentage of carbs ( and fats and protein ) that you need to thrive with the lowest risk of diseases ( as far as diet is concerned ) — all in the percentages that you need and with the micro nutrients that you need . you just don ’ t have to stress about percentages ( or calories ) . ( i got the suggestions in this paragraph by combining the advice from dr. greger and pcrm based on my own ‘ this makes sense ’ internal guide . ) to do this , it means no or extremely little : meat , dairy , eggs , oils , simple sugars / sweeteners , and highly processed foods.i hope that provides some food for thought for you . i would recommend that you take a look at the movie forks over knives . and these free videos from dr. greger : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / from-table-to-able / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death / nrostaie : re : “ … for vitamin b12 i was under the impression organ meats would be the choice , like liver ? ” i like your “ choice ” of words . : - ) all i can say is , that organ meats would not be the choice for me ! i want to be healthy and eating organ meats would not be the safest way to get b12 . i don ’ t know how much you know about b12 , but there are some excellent videos and articles on the nutritionfacts website to learn more.lol whats up with my choice of words like ? hmm ‘ main organs of animals ’ ( better : p ) have a lot of vitamin b12 , much more than most other foods.i do use another site to read up on as well , that is all based on scientific studies , its pretty useful : http : / / examine.com / faq / is-saturated-fat-bad-for-me.htmlhi nrostaie , a couple points i would make about what you ’ ve mentioned : evolutionary health of a species and longevity for an individual of that species are very different things . what we evolved eating that got enough of us to childbearing age to propogate vs what we now know through modern science that we should eat to enjoy a long lifespan and more importantly a long healthspan , may be different.what various peoples evolved eating is highly variable and dependent on where they lived . though one study dr. greger has shared shows that a likely paleolithic diet included over 100 g of fiber and 1000 % of the modern rda for vitamin c , both nutrients found exclusively in plants . so , the idea that the hunter half of the hunters and gatherers tribe were supplying the majority of the food at that time , may be flawed . further , it is somewhat arbitrary to pick a point x years in the past and say that that is the ideal diet . what about the millions of years of evolution that occurred prior ? what about changes that have occurred since ? keep in mind that trans fats which you wisely choose to avoid , are naturally occurring in meat , and the recommended intake is zero.short chain omega-3s can be obtained via flax and chia seeds , and long chain if desired can be obtained through algal supplements , without the biomagnified pollutants ( e.g. pcbs ) found in fish oil supplements.many of the readers here follow diet recommendations based on dr. greger , dr. caldwell esselstyn , jeff novick rd , dr. john mcdougall , dr. neal barnard , and others . they advocate a plant based and overall low fat diet . you mentioned macronutrient ( carb / protein / fat ) ratios . if you would like some information from a very different perspective than you have likely encountered previously , check out dr. mcdougall , who specifically recommends a very high ( complex , starch-based ) carbohydrate diet . he has a few books , but also countless newsletters , lectures , and other resources available free online . best of luck in your health journey ! https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / one of the best i ’ ve seen you put out . thank you for tackling this.thank you for this video ! i ’ ve been wondering about this question.at least we learned a thing that i think nowadays is obvious : never trust a corporation .fantastic video dr. greger . thank you so much for your important work clarifying the scientific literature.i want a bumper sticker : “ although our genetics may be different , our biology is the same , … ” this statement is profound . this video should win a prize . understanding these basic facts are key to blowing away the smoke generated by commercial interests.this is the one . if you don ’ t learn another thing about nutrition this year , this is the one to know . plus other stuff.coacervate : great idea ! i forwarded your idea on to staff to make sure they see it . some people have asked for a t-shirt with dr. greger ’ s famous “ we didn ’ t know … until now . nutrutionfacts.org ” i thought we could add your contribution to the list of purchasable options . : - ) some day … may have to make an alternate t-shirt for those videos when the situation is more along the lines of “ we didn ’ t know … until … oopswe ’ ve known since 1979 ″ maybe a got lentils ? on the back . : ) b00mer : you made me laugh ! i would totally buy one of those t-shirts too . i ’ m going to end up with an entire wardrobe . and the beginnings of a whole lotta questions with random people on the street . : - ) b00mer , coacervate and everyone : i have heard that dr. greger and the staff at nutrtionfacts.org have been really excited about the t-shirt / sticker ideas that people have come up with . they are researching the idea , starting with an informal pole on facebook . the following page is a post asking people what designs they would like to see on a t-shirt and to “ like ” designs that others post that you like also . everyone ( who has facebook – you can see the page without a facebook account , but not vote ) is welcome to participate ! https : / / www.facebook.com / nutritionfacts.org / posts / 1019332464749929what about this study ? http : / / www.plosone.org / article / info % 3adoi % 2f10.1371 % 2fjournal.pone.0113605 where the conclusion was “ the results show that dietary and plasma saturated fat are not related , and that increasing dietary carbohydrate across a range of intakes promotes incremental increases in plasma palmitoleic acid , a biomarker consistently associated with adverse health outcomes . ” just looking at it superficially , this line from the authors of the study can sum up the results : “ isocaloric high-carbohydrate diets and high-carbohydrate meals also promote dnl and hypertriglyceridemia in individuals with insulin resistance . the major product of dnl is palmitate ( 16 : 0 ) , a saturated fatty acid ( sfa ) ” so they can get away with saying “ plasma and dietary saturated fat are not related ” by doing a study on 16 obese diabetics being fed carbs of dubious quality , which causes them to synthesize saturated fats even when they ’ re eating less of them through diet . this also leads to the production of the mono-unsaturated palmitoleic acid . it ’ s pretty common for these people to use diabetics , who have an impaired tolerance for glucose , to make a misleading study about the supposed benefits that we should believe a healthy person would experience if they were to restrict carbohydrates , even from healthy sources . to make it even more confusing , they confounded much of the data by having the subjects lose weight at the same time.of course this study was performed by industry researchers , with names like jeff volek , maria luz fernandez , and stephen phinney standing out . the funding disclosure also puts this study into context : “ this work was funded by a grant from dairy research institute , the beef checkoff , the egg nutrition center , and the robert c. and veronica atkins foundation . ” volek ’ s shenanigans are wonderfully taken on by kevin klatt here : http : / / nutrevolve.blogspot.com / 2014 / 11 / carbs-sfas-and-circulating-fatty-acids.html ? m = 1and finished off

thinking that even non-animal sources of saturated fat are likely to raise our cholesterol levels ? increased saturated fat intake of any type will result in our bodies generating the production of more cholesterol ? excellent ! thanks for sharing ! hi dr. greger , i ’ m a big fan of you and admire your effort in sharing literally vital information with us.could you make a video or write an article on the website , explaining the difference between the effects of saturated fats derived from a plant-based diet ( excluding hydrogenated vegetable oils ) and an omnivorous diet ? thanks and keep up the good work ! check out the effects of coconuts on arterial health , it appears total saturated fat intake is more important than specific type in terms of heart disease prevention. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = coconutseveral years ago , in trying to diagnose what trimmed to be a medical , not a diet problem , i left veganism for a year and tried palo , including no grains . my cholesterol went from 117 with hdl higher than ldl , to 218 w / hdl higher . other metabolic problems too . all corrected when i returned to veganism.one note about this great video , we should also remember the related impacts on dementia , strokes and cancers.excellent explanation for all the conflicting theories about saturated fats . on concern that i still have is re hormones . some are stating that , men especially , need cholesterol to be able to produce adequate amts of testosterone. ie eat more meat and be more manly ! whoops . wrong text box . try my comment to you here : https : / / disqus.com / home / discussion / nutritionfacts / the _ saturated _ fat _ studies _ set _ up _ to _ fail / # comment-1777135951ken : nutritionfacts addresses testosterone and vegan men in this article : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 02 / 12 / less-cancer-in-vegan-men-despite-more-testosterone / i think that article makes it clear that one does not need to eat cholesterol to produce “ adequate ” amounts of testosterone . the vegan men ( who by definition ate no cholesterol ) had slightly more testosterone.to top it all off , the article explains why men would not want * too much * testosterone anyway – higher levels are correlated with more cancer.does that address your concern ? it ’ s quite easy to check it out yourself as i did not long ago experimenting with a vegan diet . i ate pumpkin seeds , walnuts and even consumed a zinc supplement besides various whole grains and legumes . yet my libido went down as well my strentgh and weight . i asked for advice and was told to eat more … . those same starches , legumes , whole grains etc : - ) then i googled for other people ’ s experience and found many mentions about lower libido , losing muscles and strengh on a plant based diet . so it ’ s easy to check it out yourself and find out the truth . a few months on a vegan diet will do just to make right conclusions ; ) ken , i did not experience reductions in strength

earth balance margin , 1 + quarts soy milk daily , generous peanut butter , you get the point.starting feb 2014 started true low fat whole food plant based after mcdougall conference and reading old pritikin book . the really low fat part required an “ adjustment ” . however , without really dieting or counting calories weight just slowly melted away over about 8 months . i really did wear the fat i was eating . currently eat fruits and complex starches ate each meal , fruits for snacks and several servings of greens / nutrient dense low calorie veggies a day . occasional ( not daily ) nuts

actual weights at least once a week.this was my experiencefats in general do not promote heart disease , cooked fats ( particularly animal fats ) and excessive omega-6 ’ s promote heart disease because they are highly inflammatory , and inflammation is what causes heart disease . raw , plant-based high-fat diets that have a well-balanced omega fatty acid ratio do not promote heart disease.the substitution of 2 % of energy from meat sf with energy from dairy sf was associated with a 25 % lower cvd risk . no associations were observed plant or butter sf and cvd risk ” . – http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3396447 / “ similar intakes of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids between the cases and controls indicated that the consumption of total fat or saturated fat , including that from coconut , was not a predictor for chd in this food culture . however , the intakes of animal foods , total protein , dietary cholesterol and less plant derived carbohydrates were predictors of chd ” . – http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15563444tokelauans obtain a much higher percentage of energy from coconut than the pukapukans , 63 % compared with 34 % , so their intake of saturated fat is higher . the serum cholesterol levels are 35 to 40 mg higher in tokelauans than in pukapukans . these major differences in serum cholesterol levels are considered to be due to the higher saturated fat intake of the tokelauans . analysis of a variety of food samples , and human fat biopsies show a high lauric ( 12 : 0 ) and myristic ( 14 : 0 ) content . vascular disease is uncommon in both populations and there is no evidence of the high saturated fat intake having a harmful effect in these populations ” . – http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 7270479http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15329324 – “ ” results : vco obtained by wet process has a beneficial effect in lowering lipid components compared to co . it reduced total cholesterol , triglycerides , phospholipids , ldl , and vldl cholesterol levels and increased hdl cholesterol in serum and tissues . the pf of virgin coconut oil was also found to be capable of preventing in vitro ldl oxidation with reduced carbonyl formation . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3687594 / – “ this study showed that vco supplementation is capable of preventing elevation in blood pressure and also decreasing deactivation of nitric oxide in male rats fed with repeatedly heated palm oil . in addition , vco does not influence relaxation but decreases vasoconstriction of the endothelium ” .so the first study doesn ’ t tell you the baseline cholesterol of the rats , and in particular , no low-fat diet is explored . look at table 1 of this study , for example , where control wistar rats on rat chow have an ldl of ~ 8mg / dl.http : / / www.biochemj.org / bj / 234 / 0493 / 2340493.pdfthe second rat study seems interesting , but the array of positive results reported is fairly limited . vco may be protecting the rats against repeatedly heated oil , but that ’ s something that no one should be consuming to the tune of 15 % energy anyway . benefits on vasodilation under ad libitum feeding conditions seem real enough , but the baseline diet is probably deficient in the polyphenol fraction , which could be among the things driving the apparent benefits to blood pressure and vasoconstriction . there is no strong indication that vco would be a good addition to a low fat diet already rich in other sources of polyphenol.assuming that the good would outweigh the bad in some diets is not that hard to imagine , but it doesn ’ t mean that vco is a superfood that does something which non-oily foods cannot . the authors report feeding the rats by gavage an amount corresponding to a 10ml dose in humans . 1 t of coconut oil is 117 calories ( http : / / ndb.nal.usda.gov / ndb / foods / show / 636 ? fg = & man = & lfacet = & format = & count = & max = 25 & offset = & sort = & qlookup = coconut + oil ) so 10ml coconut oil is about 117 * 10 / 14.787 = 79.1 calories , or 3.9 % energy . this is not the hugest increment in the world , so in a polyphenol-poor , low-cholesterol diet of ‘ human pellets ’ the added polyphenol fraction might well offset the negative effects of the added sf.first study : the full quote from the abstract is , ” no associations were observed between plant or butter sf and cvd risk , but ranges of intakes were narrow . ” that part at the end refers to the authors ’ belief that the statistical power may not have been sufficient for finding a substantial association between plant or butter sf and cvd risk even if it were there.sf from non-butter dairy sources seems to be better than sf from meat sources in this study , but that doesn ’ t mean that it ’ s good . they do some very wonky adjustments in their choice of models . for instance they don ’ t ever correct for dietary cholesterol , and an advantage of dairy sf over meat and egg sf is that it comes with comparatively less cholesterol . the authors say the association for benefits of increased sf in a regression model strengthens when they go from model 2 to model 3 , but note that they are also adjusting for pufa consumption as they do this . one of the most mainstream recommendations of all is that exchanging sf with pufa tends to be good for the lipid profile . model 3 also adjusts for fiber , so the range of things for which the sf calories can be exchanged in a way that would attribute reductions in risk to the reduction in sf is greatly reduced . if decreasing sf consumption is most frequently accompanied by increases in refined carbohydrate , sf won ’ t look so good in either model . correcting for trans fat would further amplify the association if the authors ’ hypothesis that trans fat in milk is comparatively good is correct.the basic fact that they never explore nutrient exchanges between dairy sf ( or dairy itself ) and unrefined carbohydrate makes this study pretty poor for your contention that high fat diets are better than low-fat diets with respect to cvd risk . also , looking at table s2 , the results for dairy are statistically non significant for chd risk by , so it ’ s not clear that the dairy sf is even benefiting all aspects of cvd . it is , at any rate , not shown to be simply a matter of one array of saturated fatty acids versus another . in the words of the authors , “ in conclusion , we showed that associations between sf and incident cvd depend on the food source ; the consumption of dairy sf is inversely associated with risk , and the consumption of meat sf is positively associated with risk . our findings raise the possibility that associations of foods that contain sf with health may depend on specific fatty acids present in these foods or the complex admixture of other food constituents , in addition to sf . ” the fact that they didn ’ t control very well for other food constituents strongly raises the possibility that it is substantially a matter of patterns of nutrient consumption that correlate with dairy sf versus meat sf.second study : the population under examination does not eat much of a high fat diet : only 24 % energy . they consume pitiful amounts of fiber so the primary exchange for coconut oil and palm oil is probably refined carbohydrate , meat , and eggs . coconut milk is primarily consumed in fish and vegetable dishes according to the authors , and additional long-chain omega-3 may reduce the cvd risk in this population . in the words of the authors : “ in this population , coconut ( a saturated fat source ) is used in the cooking of fish and vegetables . hence , any potentially adverse effects of coconut-derived saturated fat may be offset by the cardio-protective role of the coconut-associated fish and vegetable intakes in the minangkabau food culture . ” above all , this is a case-control study , making it only marginally better than a raw cross-sectional analysis . any associations linking plant sources of sf to cvd are likely to be biased toward the null.third study : the tokelauans eat a high-fat diet more coconuts and have higher cholesterol . how does this support your contention ? “ no evidence of high saturated fat intake having a harmful effect ” may sound definitive in the abstract , but with remote islanders like this , how hard do you think they actually looked ? if there were a moderately harmful effect , did they have the power to detect it ? the authors themselves have this to say , if you actually read the study : “ the influence these traditional diets may have on development of atherosclerosis is an important question . twelve lead ecgs have been taken in both groups and the rate of subnormal q waves , minnesota code 1 and 12 was very low in both groups . the samples of adults on the two atolls are , however , too small for definitive studies of coronary heart disease and vascular disease . ” in other words , they don ’ t have a definitive study on coronary disease in this population . their sample is too small . combine this with factors particular to the island natives but not general to the postindustrial world , such as genetic drift or cholesterol-lowering parasites , and it is hard to see how you can reliably generalize this to a statement about the healthfulness of plant-based sf for the general population of the developed world.plant positive made a number of these same criticisms about the study and a few more . you can watch here : http : / / plantpositive.com / blog / 2012 / 3 / 27 / the-tokelauans-the-samburu-and-the-masai-again.htmlto talk about your style of argumentation currently , one problematic pattern is that you don ’ t seem to be giving much indication that you have actually read the studies in question . for each study you mine out a single quote , often one from the abstract , and at times selectively , dropping out an important part of the sentence . even if your quotations were all complete , you show no synthesis . you don ’ t actually talk about how your studies relate to each other , how they work together in a chain of reasoning to support your claim , and you certainly don ’ t discuss where your argument could be weak.the sort of things that i would like to see to really give credibility to the claim that high-sf whole plant foods like coconuts don ’ t affect coronary risk would be : 1. systematic observations ( preferably controlled trials ) that more coconuts don ’ t worsen the lipid profile of people with good lipid profiles 2. cohort studies of reasonably large populations in which substitution of coconuts for unrefined starches is shown to not substantially increase rates of symptomatic cvd or cvd mortality 3. strong mechanistic arguments that most types of saturated fatty acids have little effect on ldl in humans , provided some aspect of a healthy diet ( such as low dietary cholesterol ) is in place 4. intervention trials in which high-sf wfpb diets markedly reduce cvd in high risk groups.otherwise i will tend to assume that coconut oil is , like other refined oils , a relatively suboptimal food from a health standpoint ; and that while one could probably do much worse than eating coconuts , the health of high-fat wfpb foods as a major component of the diet is a bit less evidenced than , say , legumes.also , i don ’ t think you ’ ve presented any coherent evidence at all for your idea that raw foodism is important for optimal health.the omega 6 = inflammation theory is not panning out.specific omega-6 ’ s and excessive omega-6 ’ s are highly inflammatory . some omega-6 ’ s , such as gla , are anti-inflammatory but most are not . high amounts of raw , omega-3 fats ( walnuts , chia , flax , hemp ) do not promote heart-disease.i think this video from plant positive is relevant. http : / / plantpositive.com / 41-pufas-oxidize / eat more meat and get ed from atherosclerosis . won ’ t matter how much testosterone there is.modern medicine has made a consensus health recommendation that supports the recommendations of dr. greger in this site that meat , and particularly the saturated fat in meat , is unhealthy.people should only get 5 % -6 % calories from saturated fat people should reduce their percent of calories from saturated fat people should reduce the percent of calories from trans fatsaturated fat and cholesterol has a linear relationship . with ldl = 1.5 times saturated fat intake . each extra gram of saturated fat you take increases your ldl by 2 / 3 gram.in the study presented here , feeding vegetarians meat just once a day raised their cholesterol 20 points in a month to a risk level ( ldl about 150 units ) for heart disease . after they stopped eating the meat , within two weeks their cholesterol fell the same 20 points . this was just on one piece of meat a day . there doesn ’ t seem to be any safe level of meat consumption.to lower bad cholesterol , this site would recommendnuts ( particularly almonds ) , whole grains ( like cheerioes ) , flax seed meal , kiwi , grapefruit , red yeast rice , dried apples , amla , and beans like chickpeas . the vegan diet is very recommended for heart disease , however , according to dr. greger , it is “ maybe too effective , ” with some people having to add diary or meat back.in my book cheerios may start with whole grain oats but then adds modified corn starch , sugar , tripotassium phosphate , wheat starch and then a variety of synthetic vitamins , hardly making it a natural healthy food . read the ingredients on the box. http : / / www.cheerios.com / products / cheerios.aspx why not just cook up some steel cut oats overnight in the crock pot ? even rolled oats would be a better choice than cheerios.yes of course . rolled oats are a very good choice . eating 48 grams of whole grain is very beneficial , and as you say , unprocessed whole grain should be better ! almost 40 percent of america will never eat whole grains . a single bowl of rolled oats would be statistically more whole grain than most americans eat in a month . eating a bowl of oatmeal a day could add as much to your life as jogging four hours a week or eating four handfuls of walnuts a week , according to this site . the fda claim that cheerios lower cholesterol is asserted by this site and uses this source : maki kc , beiseigel jm , jonnalagadda ss , gugger ck , reeves ms , farmer mv , kaden vn , rains tm . whole-grain ready-to-eat oat cereal , as part of a dietary program for weight loss , reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adults with overweight and obesity more than a dietary program including low-fiber control foods . j am diet assoc . 2010 feb ; 110 ( 2 ) : 205-14.well that last part is the key to understanding the entire study . “ whole-grain ready-to-eat oat cereal , as part of a dietary program for weight loss , reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adults with overweight and obesity more than a dietary program including low-fiber control foods . ” if you compare those who ate whole grain ready-to-eat cereals as part of their dietary program for weight loss to those whose dietary program for weight lose included low-fiber foods , of course the ready to eat cereals would reduce ldl more . but cheerios is still a processed food with sugar and corn and wheat starch . still like plain steel-cut or rolled oats as a healthier choice . cheers ! lindaand i myself am not too fond of red yeast rice either . basically a natural statin , which ( although to a much less degree ) interfere with coq 10 production and “ possibly ” activate the atrogen 1 gene like the statin drugs . this gene promotes muscle breakdown.the “ study ” used by those advocating the use of saturated fat was not really a study at all . instead , it was advertising dressed up as a study.there is an old saying in sales : “ if you can ’ t convince ‘ em , confuse ‘ em . ” this is one of the best videos you have ever posted ! thank-you . i agree with those that say this needs to be on dateline or something . it is shameful that influential magazines and even journals are publishing such fraudulent and misleading reports without challenge.this is gratifying that the today show would say here , http : / / www.today.com / health / avocado-day-lowers-cholesterol-1d80410564 “ the findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier . they were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks , and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn ’ t get the extra oils.saturated fat – the kind found in meat and butter – has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products . repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease . ” this must have the same metabolic ward studies that greger mentioned in mind . it also makes me think of how the calorie theory has been proven by similar kinds of studies in which diet is totally controlled . usually these studies show similar weight loss to similar calorie deficits . the calorie theory is true for everyone , but similarly to cholesterol levels , the required calorie intake level varies by individuals quite a bit . i am interested in refuting the low carb crowd on the saturated fat issue , the calorie theory which they deny , as well as their view that exercise is totally inefficacious for weight loss . i lost a lot of weight by controlling calorie intake and exercise . once i added in an almost completely plant based diet , i lost even more weight and my ldl and triglycerides continue to drop . by the way , being almost entirely plant has not lowered my hdl score as clem k below noted , which is around 80 now . exercise is infinitely better for raising hdl than eating saturated fat . i used to have hdl below 20 and it has shot up much further by daily bicycling than eating saturated fat ever could . probably eating plants is better for lowering ldl than exercise , but exercise is better for raising hdl . losing 100 pounds has also helped in improving my numbers , but further improvements in diet improved it even more.why not put utube link to all videos ? utube videos easy to

about the subject . perhaps i should take this quote from him more sceptically than in the past : in the epilogue to good calories , bad calories on page 454 , taubes notes ten “ inescapable ” conclusions , the first of which is : [ 13 ] dietary fat , whether saturated or not , is not a cause of obesity , heart disease , or any other chronic disease of civilization.how is this video not telling me that it is better to eat lean skinless chicken breast than walnuts ? i really need an answer to this since i regularly encourage folks to eat walnuts.yesterday ( 1 / 7 / 2015 ) , dr. greger posted a short article on walnuts at the care2 website : http : / / www.care2.com / greenliving / walnuts-improve-artery-function.html excerpt : “ eating at least one serving of walnuts per week may drop our chances of a cardiovascular-related death by 50 % . ” and , he has a good summary about the problems with chicken on this website : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / chicken / excerpt : “ chicken is deficient in antioxidants , phytonutrients , and fiber , while potentially containing excessive salt , flame-retardant chemicals , ages , arachidonic acid , paralysis-causing bacteria ( that can cross-contaminate other foods and surfaces ) , and cancer-causing agents . ” from the usda website 3oz of skinless roasted chicken breast ( about 1 / 2 of a chicken breast ) has the exactly the same amount of saturated fat ( 0.87g ) as 1 / 2 ounce of walnuts ( which is what i eat daily ) . the chicken breast serving has 73mg of cholesterol vs. 0 for the walnuts . the chicken has 0mg of fiber vs. 1mg for the walnuts . the chicken has ~ 0.04mg of omega-3s , whereas the walnut serving has 1.3g ( as alpha-linolenic acid , ala ) .posted this y ’ day and got no answers . so i ’ ll try again.couple questions if anyone can help out . i notice in the video that the hdl levels were down in the low 30 ’ s . i ’ ve read that a vegan diet will lower hdl because of the high carb component and will also turn the type a ldl ’ s to type b. is a high hdl more important than a low ldl ? and is this true , or even important about the type a versus type b particles ? lastly , any idea what ldl-p look like for vegans ? i assume it must in the range of optimal ( i.e < 1,000 ) ? thanks in advance.w.r.t. hdl , dr. mcdougall set it best 10 + years ago in his newsletter , “ when one eats more garbage ( saturated fat and cholesterol ) one may need more metabolic garbage trucks ( like hdl ) to get rid of it . eating a stick of butter may raise one ’ s hdl , but that doesn ’ t mean chewing one down is good for one ’ s heart . ” thus , when one switches from sad ( std american diet ) to a low-fat whole-food plant-based diet ( wfpb ) , one may notice a drop in hdl . on a personal note , when i did this , my hdl dropped ~ 10 % , but my ldl dropped ~ 30 % ( 6 years ago ) . my latest numbers : total cholesterol is 141 ; ldl , 75 ; hdl 47 ; triglycerides , 75 . no medications . only supplement is b12.thanks for the reply fred . out of curiosity , what constitutes low fat in your diet as a % ? between 10 and 15 % . < 10 % is optimal ( per ornish and esselstyn published research ) for someone who has heart disease . the most important aspect is to keep saturated fat < 5 % , which is easy for me to do.thx againclem : fred did a truly great job of answering part of your question . i believe that the following nutritionfacts video will answer your question about type a vs type b. the video talks about the size of cholesterol particle . i could be wrong , but i think that “ ldl size ” is the same argument / issue as a vs b : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-cholesterol-size-matter / bottom line is : worrying about size / a / b of ldl cholesterol is like worrying about whether you should eat beat sugar or cane sugar … or … canola oil vs olive oil , etc . it ’ s not an argument worth having . none of it is terribly healthy . keep the focus on the big picture , which is : having an overall healthy eating pattern leads to lower risk factors . in the case of heart attacks , the way to be heart-attack proof is to have a total cholesterol under ~ 150 and an ldl under ~ 70 . the evidence shows that the best way for most of us to get those low risk factors is with a low fat whole plant food based diet.if you want a more detailed look at the issue , here are

up now . hope that helps ! : ) i noticed ! yay ! ! ! thanks ! what this video fails to tell you is that there are three different types of ldl . small dense , medium and large fluffy . it has been verified by a multitude of studies , that the large fluffy ldl is actually good for you . what turns your ldl into large fluffy particles ? saturated fat . what raises your hdl ( good cholesterol ) ? saturated fat . what lowers your ldl and turns it in to small dense particles ? sugar , wheat or any high glycemic carbohydrates . more and more studies are showing that the higher your cholesterol actually means you have a chance at living longer . thousands of people that have heart disease have shown to have optimal low cholesterol . so why does it still happen ? because its the type of cholesterol you have . next time you get a blood test , ask for a particle test as well . vegetables are fantastic for you , don ’ t get me wrong , but don ’ t get the wrong idea about saturated fat . there are no controlled studies that actually prove the connection between saturated fat and heart disease.here ’ s a video ( mentioned above by thea ) on the ldl size matter : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-cholesterol-size-matter / … in which you will find , for example , this : “ cholesterol , largely transported through the body as ldl-c , has clearly been established as a causal agent in atherosclerosis over many decades of extensive research ( 10 ) . regardless of size , ldl particles are atherogenic . ” http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s073510971204942xi look forward to the citations that “ large fluffy ldl is actually good for you ” … hi josh , not to be a stickler but when you make a comment like “ it has been verified by a multitude of studies , that the large fluffy ldl is actually good for you ” you should cite your source . that source should be a well done study.josh : as kylemeister posted so well , the idea that fluffy ldl “ is actually good for you ” is not supported by the evidence . after watching the video that kylemeister pointed you to , i recommend taking a look at the following pages / videos for more details : http : / / plantpositive.com / 25-cholesterol-confusion-8-a-l http : / / plantpositive.com / apob-at-the-eating-academy-nushttp : / / www.greenmedinfo.com / blog / 50-latest-coconut-oil-benefits-backed-scienceinteresting . someone may have mentioned this already , but the hooper et al. review paper you discuss only shows a modest decrease in cardiovascular events in men , but no decrease in either cardiovascular deaths or total deaths from all causes . also very important for 1 / 2 the population , no changes were seen in women . i also believe that there is a body of research that shows that cholesterol lower than 150 is associated with more cancer deaths . so you are correct , nutrition data is very complicated , and i don ’ t think the answer is actually clear yet . it is complicated to study though , that it seems like it may be a long time before the answer is really clear . one thing i do believe though is that one should eat lots of fruits and vegetables no matter what you believe about fat / animal protein.regarding the cancer thing , i wonder if you could be referring to stuff which suffers from such problems as reverse causation or survivorship bias , as brought up in about the first third of this video / transcript : http : / / plantpositive.com / blog / 2012 / 3 / 27 / cholesterol-cancer-and-depression.htmlif you read the review , a lot of studies with low risk populations were included and with such short trial duration , i anticipate that this would tend to attenuate the benefits . women in particular were not in the interventions for high risk groups . when sf intakes are only modestly reduced cholesterol levels will only be modestly reduced , and especially over the short term , cardiovascular events may be driven more by the inflammation of plaque than its gradual buildup per se . the authors have this comment about the cholesterol reductions actually achieved : “ rather surprisingly much of the total cholesterol reduction in the dietary trials comes from a low risk trial , the minnesota coronary trial , as modified institutional food was provided to a vast number of low risk people over only one year on average , resulting in a large reduction in total cholesterol , but with little change in cardiovascular events and a slight increase in mortality . if the minnesota coronary trial is excluded the initial total serum cholesterol level within the dietary trials is 6.46 mmol / litre and the mean change in total cholesterol between the control and intervention groups is a fall of 0.47 mmol / litre ( 7.3 % ) in the intervention groups , only a third of the total serum cholesterol fall expected with statin therapy.this relatively small degree of lipid lowering may be a reason that no significant effect of dietary fat intervention was seen on total or cardiovascular mortality in the short term . the larger number of total cardiovascular events than of deaths provides greater statistical power . there was a suggestion from the meta-regression that a greater degree of reduction of total serum cholesterol resulted in a greater reduction in events . ” plant positive has also covered the minnesota coronary study , and centers much of his attention on this comment about the diets : “ procurement of suitable foods for the treatment diet , ( with the desired polyunsaturated fat , which were yet palatable , stable , and indistinguishable from the corresponding components of the control diet ) presented a great challenge . it was achieved through cooperation of the study nutritionists , the hospital dietitians , manufacturers of food products , and the food inspection division of the minnesota department of agriculture . products that proved particularly useful were filled milk and ice cream , a whole egg substitute , soft margarine , whipped topping , filled cheese , low fat ground beef with added vegetable oil , and filled sausage products . ” http : / / atvb.ahajournals.org / content / 9 / 1 / 129.full.pdf + htmlthat is , given the time at which the study was conducted and the lengths to which they were processing oils to make them seem similar to s , one can expect a lot of trans fats , which probably have negative effects on cardiovascular risk above and beyond their effects on the lipid profile . at 45 % e from fat and only about 8 % e from s with p : s = 2.5 , that ’ s a lot of unsaturated oil to act as an entry point for trans fat . there are probably some good reasons to exclude this study , therefore.this issue with trans fats is just one example of the variables which may have confounded the effect of saturated fat reduction.thanks for the reference kyle . i need to think about reverse causation more , but as for survivorship bias , the hooper et al review paper did not demonstrate a difference in either cardiovascular mortality or overall mortality in the “ less sat fat ” group , so i ’ m not sure that the “ survivorship bias ” argument would hold here . i think the data is actually very conflicting , and i ’ m still trying to figure it all out . some papers support , some do not . so confusing , and i don ’ t think it ’ s just the dairy / egg industry that is trying to make it confusing , i think it just is confusing . and again , it seems that for women , there is no clear evidence that higher sat fat diets cause increased cardiovascular events , cardiovascular mortality or overall mortality . at least not in the review paper that dr. greger cites in the video.seems like doubt is janet ’ s product.thanks for

uk schools to judge how well schools are doing . there is no recognition of the fact that children from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds have a different starting point than those of their wealthier peers . this misinterpretation of data allows government to blame teachers rather than spend additional money to give these children the support they need to fill the gap . use and abuse of data . must teach my pupils about this tomorrow.dr greger , what about this group of “ doctors ” who are saying that cholesterol is not the problem , inflammation is . they claim they ’ ve seen people with cholesterol levels above 500 who are “ healthy ” . the “ cholesterol myth ” they claim , is false . they are saying that sugar is the reason our bodies put down plaque to protect our arteries from the inflammation . there seems to be a pretty big camp promoting this . i left a doctor because of it . ( he himself was obese , not a good example ! ) . my chiropractor is promoting this lie even now . the atkins diet is a no sugar diet isn ’ t it ? those people have to have cholesterol levels through the roof , is there any study showing the heart disease rates and other disease rates for people eating a high fat , no sugar diet ? there is a big enough group of them out there , they seem to be popping up everywhere because people love to be told that they can indulge in all the meat / dairy they want and still be healthy and trim ! http : / / www.naturalnews.com / 035514 _ cholesterol _ myths _ heart _ doctor.html # there is a growing fashion about eating more “ healthy fats ” eg the bulletproof diet . is there any data justifying this ? the current “ healthy fats ” thing is just a really lazy but surprisingly effective way to sell a bad diet to people . “ healthy fats ” used to mean things like nuts and avocados , for which most of the benefits probably actually come from the polyphenols than the actual fats , but you could still say they were a healthy source of fat compared to obviously unhealthy sources like lard and butter . now fad diet promoters have hijacked the phrase and label high saturated fat foods “ good fats ” or “ healthy fats ” to make them sound nice.like i said , it ’ s just a really lazy way to convince people that obviously unhealthy foods should be considered healthy . add a “ grass-fed ” or a “ pasture-raised ” too and people will think it sounds natural enough that it must be good for you.thank you for this. i have tried many diets and fitness but stay stubbornly at the same weight . i have to admit that i have recently been trying the bullet proof diet and find the butter laden coffee in the morning satiates me and i am losing weight as a result . you are saying i shouldn ’ t be doing this ? i ’ m saying for health reasons , drinking coffee mixed with a stick of butter isn ’ t a great thing to do . for weight loss , if it ’ s working , i can ’ t argue with the results , although i don ’ t think it ’ s the only option and probably still not the best option . vegetables , fruits , legumes , and fiberous whole grains would be more sustainable diet choices for long-term weight loss / management.thank you so much . i am very lost in the diet debates and i know quite a lot of science. are you an expert in this stuff ? paleo vs vegetarian vs vegan vs dr hymn ’ s vs perlmutter etc ? hi khawar , below is an excellent presentation by dr. doug lisle , which describes a way of eating that will not only facilitate weight loss , but will also improve those aspects of our health which may not be visible , e.g. protecting us from diseases such as heart disease , cancer , and diabetes . if you haven ’ t watched them yet , i would also highly recommend dr. greger ’ s year-in-review lectures ( ~ 1 h long ) : “ uprooting the leading causes of death ” , “ more than an apple a day : combating our most common diseases ” , and “ from table to able : combating disabling diseases with food ” . they are all linked to at the bottom of the nutritionfacts home / front page.dr. doug lisle : “ how to lose weight without losing your mind ” https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = xadqlb6btuqthank you so much . i will read / watch all of these . it is very kind of you to respond.what i don ’ t understand is the following . if it is al one big conspiracy of the industry . why does red-meat comes out so bad in all the meta-analysises on cardio vascular disease ? is the red-meat industry not able to hide the results ? dairy comes out not so bad , chicken not bad too ( in these papers ) however red-meat does comes out bad . i kind of trust the results about dairy , because the researchers are able to find a very bad relationship with red meat and cvd … dispite the industry.it is not one big conspiracy . there is good science and there are good scientists . industry doesn ’ t have a limitless power to distort the science , and distorted science tends to be more effective on naive consumers than on experienced academics . there are conflicts within industry and many industries ( like the chicken industry ) have much to gain by saying they are better than beef or by allowing other people to say that beef is bad . even pork , a red meat , has promoted itself in the us as “ the other white meat ” .there are in fact meta-analyses out there stating no association between red meat and chd . here ’ s one : http : / / circ.ahajournals.org / content / 121 / 21 / 2271.fullit ’ s making that conclusion based on a grand total of 4 included studies . one of the two studies which found a relative risk less than 1 also found a strongly protective association for sweets , cakes , and puddings . the other is based on a limited questionnaire of eating habits for a population of australian aborigines , during a time when they were known to be on a very poor diet linked with poverty , poor education , and low social status in an industrial society — probably part of the reason why none of the items on the questionnaire actually asked about vegetable consumption . i wouldn ’ t call it a high-quality or particularly informative meta-analysis , but it ’ s a meta-analysis.attention : doctors michael gregor , caldwell esselstyn , dean ornish , john macdougall and others . i could use your help ! ! not for myself , but for many thousands of others who will likely follow the same path as my husband and i have . here ’ s why.timely video . yesterday , the vancouver sun newspaper ( vancouver , bc ) published a story in their “ health ” section titled “ st. paul ’ s to launch mediterranean diet course ” . sounds like a lofty goal that should be beneficial to someone eating a standard north american diet . the problem is that st. paul ’ s hospital cardiology department is setting up this course . st paul ’ s also happens to be arguably the premier cardiac center of british columbia , canada . quoting a study published last year in the new england journal of medicine which apparently shows that the two groups of patients eating a higher fat mediterranean diet did 30 % better than the low-fat diet group ( and who also apparently happen to be more prone to diabetes because they are eating the low-fat diet ) . for any one interested in reading the article , here is the link http : / / www.vancouversun.com / health / paul + hospital + launch + mediterranean + diet + course + public / 10716642 / story.htmli wanted to write a letter to their cardiology department and am having difficulty pulling together enough information quickly and compiling it into a compelling case for them to give their heads a shake – to take the time to get the truth . over five years ago , my husband had a heart attack and had two stents put in . he was never told there was any other option . he was only told to eat less and exercise more but with no actual guidelines or parameters . he chose to go on an atkins type diet . a friend chose the same path . although they both lost weight , the friend dropped dead of a massive heart attack within a year . so , he went back to the old way of eating , trying to consume less . and of course , he had to take several drugs for blood pressure , cholesterol , blood thinning ( all the usual and then all the subsequent additions and modifications until everything was regulated to their satisfaction ) . he also had to see the doctor every six months for follow-up including bloodwork . he was given copies of the blood work and told everything was in order . but , we now know it never really was . five years later he was having heart attack symptoms and although he didn ’ t actually have a second heart attack , he did require a second round of stents . it is to be noted here that the stents were for blockages in arteries that had not been occluded initially . there still remained occluded blood vessels that were insufficiently blocked to require stenting but that after five year also hadn ’ t gotten any worse . this time the operating cardiologist told him this outcome was to be expected because , afterall , heart disease is a chronc condition that continues to progress throughout one ’ s life.then i had a stroke . i decided to look for information i needed to improve my health on the internet . and guess what i found ? i got real answers . yes there was the usual rhetoric and confusion on the issue but i found information backed by real studies with real results . i now eat a low fat vegan diet ( whole food plant-based and organic as much as possible ) . because i discovered that my blood pressure was sodium driven , i eliminted it from my diet . of course that ruled out virtually every processed food – even vegan . of course i pay no attention to the sodium found naturally in foods as it doesn ’ t seem to drive my blood pressure . you won ’ t actually find much advice to completely stop adding sodium . i have even seen articles stating that to do so could be dangerous . but my intuition told me that if human beings were supposed to eat as much sodium as recommended , well we wouldn ’ t even exist on this planet . because , except for people consuming a lot of sea vegetables and sea water , most humans could not consume a level much higher than 500mg per day from real food sources . the drugs i was initially prescribed have all been abandoned in favour of nothing other than food . and my blood pressure and blood work numbers are all in the very best range . the 50 extra pounds i was carrying around literally melted off my body in just over 3 months and has never come back . i can eat as much as i want , whenever i want . no calories to count . no diet to follow . and i feel great . we walk 30 minutes everday.bev , congratulations on your success ! regarding the st. paul program , this article by dr. dean ornish describes the shortcomings of the nejm article quite well : http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com / dr-dean-ornish / mediterranean-diet _ b _ 2755940.htmlthanks so much for the link.regards , bev brysonthanks for your other posted reply ! further to your reply somewhat similar to here , well organized community elbow grease with appropriate levers of power can accomplish much with less effort . metaphorically totally in line with your own new found lifestyle some offline contact in face of all the delusional stuff going on might make for a better prep regarding this fall . i can be contacted at my full name dot comnext time get a narrator who is serious about speaking english.you talk as though cholesterol was a disease . we all want to avoid heart disease but , since that doesn ’ t correlate with cholesterol , who cares ? big pharma has conned us into buying their drugs , not for good health , but for low cholesterol . billions wasted ! citation needed for your non-correlation between heart disease and cholesterol.how do these experts address the curious fact that half of the people that have heart attacks have high cholesterol and half have low ? ? ? how about the study in denmark that showed the higher the cholesterol , the longer people lived ? how about citing the actual study or the actual fact with links ? also , it helps to define what you mean by ‘ low ’ . it ’ s hard to respond to your language at present because it is lacking in important details.karl arman : for low to have any meaning in regards to health , “ low ” has to mean the level which does not cause disease . to truly have low cholesterol , someone needs to have a total cholesterol under about 150 and ldl under 70 . at that level , people do not have heart attacks.the problem is that the medical establishment has taken the stance that low should be defined in relationship to populations which are dying of heart attacks . in other words , it is not true that half the people who have heart attacks have low cholesterol . instead , what we know is that the definition of low in the medical community / testing labs is meaningless and that almost all of the people who have heart attacks have high cholesterol . make sense ? i don ’ t know anything about that study in denmark . as largelytrue requested , it would be necessary to get a link to that study in order to be able to comment on it . and i ’ ll leave it up to largelytrue if you do . she / he has a great handle on the studies out there.you can make all the same arguments about studies funded by the vegetable oil industry , the statin industry , or any others ( vegetarians ) who have a vested interest in a specific outcome . what you are saying is that your diet-heart theory cant be proven by observational study so we should accept on faith that sfa ’ s cause heart disease , even in light of a multitude of other studies that show no correlation . according to your analysis cross-sectional studies present inaccurate conclusions because they are not tightly controlled . however , given the massive amount of data and studies conducted you would have to assume some valid information could be extracted , its silly to suggest otherwise . and yet no correlation can be shown between sfas and cad / chd . we now know that cholesterol is much more complex than originally thought with hdl , ldl particle size ( and fat vs sugar ’ s affect on it ) , etc . ldl may be an indicator for coronary risk but its not a very good one relative to others . for this reason its possible that sfa ’ s affect on ldl may not be as detrimental as once thought.what greger is saying is that one type of statistical study design is generally inappropriate for testing one aspect of diet-heart : namely , the connection between diet and serum biomarkers such as the ldl fraction . there are other study designs which are better for studying the relationship , such as prospective cohort studies or metabolic ward studies.got any references about a biomarker that is a better marker of coronary risk in those who don ’ t already face a relatively high risk ? both hdl and triglycerides are beginning to get more attention as the superior measures of coronary risk . see the link below ( hopefully this site accepts them ) .http : / / www.functionalmedicineuniversity.com / public / 796.cfmalso , metabolic syndrome has proven to be a very good indicator of risk ( hdl , hypertension , large waist , etc ) . it does not measure ldl . lastly , resting heart rate may also be a good predictor . although not widely used there is compelling evidence that it can predict coronary risk . with every 10 bpm rise in rhr there is a dramatic increase in risk . i like this one because its intuitive. if you have narrowing of the arteries your heart has to work harder to supply blood to the body , hence it beats faster . both of these are well documented by reputable sources if you google them . sorry but i am short on time to provide additional links.i was specific in asking for a predictor of the variation in risk for comparatively low-risk groups because when ldl is lowered by means of lifestyle , most measures put people in a low-risk category . my last basic lipid panel indicates tc : hdl as ideal according to your source , for example — and on sight alone , it would be laughable to claim that i have metabolic syndrome . the metabolic syndrome is meant to pick out people with relatively high risk ( for diabetes especially ) within a group of people with fairly high cvd risk on average , as far as i know . a measure that is principally validated in high risk groups over the short term is not the measure that i want for determining my risk over the long term.just look at the table for the controls ’ lipids in your references reference about tg / hdl ( http : / / circ.ahajournals.org / content / 96 / 8 / 2520 / t4.expansion.html ) . normotensive , nonsmoking males with the median scores of the lowest-tg quartile would have 10-year mi risk of 1 % at age 40 ( ! ) according to the framingham model . females would have 3 % risk at age 70 . in reality we know that these basic , well-validated risk factors would probably get worse for these people as middle age progresses . the situation looks even uglier for the other quartiles , to say nothing of the matched cases who actually had mi ( whose risk factors and plasma characteristics were for some reason not reported in this study ) .the concern about robust causation is important , too . something that best signals a problem in the free-living population is not necessarily the best target for treatment or lifestyle management . resting heart rate may be ‘ intuitive ’ to you ( isn ’ t ldl concentration also ‘ intutive ’ , especially over the entire lifespan ? ) and is probably a sign of good health when it ’ s on the low side , but there are highly relevant ways in which rhr may improve without seriously affecting the risk of mi . after all , you say that it is a marker for stenosis , but functional impairments due to stenosis are not necessary in order to yield a major thrombotic event . and while cardiovascular exercise is generally good for you and a stronger heart can help a lot in giving a lower rhr , the tissue in a strong heart is just as prone to dying as that in a weak one when a feeding coronary artery is plugged by thrombus.i could go on in trying to unpack the circumstances in which hdl changes are likely to be good for you versus those in which the changes may have null ( or even harmful ) effect on ldl risk ( something that i ’ m not fully settled on ) , but as you say , you don ’ t have much time even to point to strong reviews of the literature , so i probably can ’ t expect to get much for myself out of the conversation on this topic . i ’ ll leave it with my above comments for now and perhaps we can come to this topic eventually if you turn out to have enough of both time and expertise for a useful conversation.intuition is not science , just a personal comment.http : / / www.webmd.com / heart-disease / news / 20111220 / study-increase-in-resting-heart-rate-over-time-linked-heart-disease-death “ increase in resting heart rate linked to deaththe study included nearly 30,000 men and women without known heart disease . researchers measured their resting heart rate twice about 10 years apart . compared to healthy people whose resting heart rate stayed less than 70 beats per minute during a 10-year period , those whose pulse was less than 70 beats per minute at the first measurement and then greater than 85 at the second were more likely to die from heart disease and other causes after 12 years of follow-up.participants whose heart rate was between 70 and 85 at the first measure and then greater than 85 the next time it was measured were also more likely to die from heart disease or other causes.further study is needed , but the findings may help identify a group of seemingly healthy people who are at risk for heart disease before they develop any other signs or symptoms , the study authors conclude . ” note the last paragraph . if your question is how to identify risk in otherwise healthy , low-risk people this shows promise . like i said , not as widely used.another link , more academic : http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0735109707018232with that , i am not sure i completely understand your question / concern . if you are in a low risk group and tg / hdl looks good there should not be a concern . obviously , nothing in life is guaranteed . low ldl levels don ’ t seem to guarantee survival either . btw , the framingham risk score has been critisized , i wouldn ’ t put too much stock in it.http : / / healthland.time.com / 2011 / 09 / 14 / rethinking-the-framingham-score-is-there-a-better-way-to-predict-heart-disease / lastly , i don ’ t believe these things get worse as you get older . i am 48 and my cholesterol and blood pressure are exactly what they were over 10 years ago . the primary reason they get worse with age in some people is because of inactivity . i am an endurance cyclist and i have no doubt this is why my numbers are stable.the exact optimality of the framingham model was not my primary reason for using it . use your chiropractic reference ’ s standard of hdl / tc if you like ; the study population is still less than ideal , on the whole . i don ’ t really see what it is in that news article that has you questioning the predictive power of the framingham model so strongly , and one of the most notable ways in which the model was suggested to underperform in that article — namely. the increased tendency to respond to a poor score with improved behavior — is essentially irrelevant to a discussion of what should be considered a poor score in the first place.the paper on hr is interesting , and as a risk factor which can be readily measured without any special equipment or physician ’ s help , it has some promising potential . i ’ m not sure that the extent of the causal underpinnings is yet well understood , but this could be a factor which impacts risk somewhat independently of other factors such as ldl , thus improving predictive power in epidemiological models and the overall causal theory.i ’ m not really sure i understand your concern about misunderstanding my concern . if i ’ m in a ‘ low ’ risk group that nonetheless experiences some risk , that means that i would want to understand what causes risk to vary within the group so that i could move toward the shallow end of the pool . even if i thought myself to be in a zero-risk group , i still have some basis risk because my theory might be wrong ; i ’ ll want to be alert to any sufficiently plausible thing that may knock me out of the group . even if i have low risk of ischemic stroke and mi so long as i continue as i am , i ’ m also concerned about more subtle risks ( like transient ischemic attack ) that could impact my quality of life but haven ’ t been studied in depth because the symptoms don ’ t always stand out acutely.the reality is that i ’ d agree with you that much of the climb in tc and ldl with age is probably connected with increasing adiposity and concomitant inflammation . those without the fat gain will tend to do better . still , age appears as an independent risk factor in many epidemiological models , largely because atherosclerosis continues to progress on an atherogenic diet and because plaques become less stable as other aspects of aging progress . i ’ m a bit of a halfling , having eaten an atherogenic diet for much of my life . to the extent that i can help it , i do not want the plaque that i have to become a liability later in life . because of this and other risk factors which i cannot modify so easily , i ’ m interested in having a highly protective diet that may also regress some aspects of the physical disease . as long as i ’ m relatively indifferent to what i eat ( healthy food is plenty tasty , cheap , and not that hard to prepare ) and as long as i ’ m not compromising my ability to protect myself from other diseases through diet ( the evidence seems to be that the dietary prescriptions for limiting the risk of the most common diseases are largely compatible ) , i can let my risk-aversion toward cvd run relatively freely so long as i am working with credible evidence.what the heck is up with this study : http : / / www.latinpost.com / articles / 20511 / 20140901 / benefits-of-a-low-carb-diet-beat-low-fat-in-nih-study.htmdr. david katz gave the most complete and sensible critique of the research design of which i ’ m aware : https : / / www.linkedin.com / pulse / 20140902121017-23027997-diet-research-stuck-in-the-stone-agewhat are the risks of plant-based saturated fat like coconut , nuts , etc . ? are there concerns about those ? can you debunk this ? http : / / vitals.lifehacker.com / contrary-to-belief-saturated-fat-isnt-bad-for-your-hea-1684749042 / + whitsongordonwhat total drivel ! call yourself a professor ? there is not connection between cholesterol level and heart disease , that is the point ! read the research and stop being biased . bias in science renders it non-science , otherwise known as nonsense.dr gregor , what is your opinion of the book by dr malcolm kendrick – he is claiming that cholesterol levels are not an indicator for heart diseasedavid : i think this would be at least part of dr. greger ’ s response : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / optimal-cholesterol-level / saturated fat and cholesterol don ’ t cause heart disease . the people who told you this for years aren ’ t happy with the truth coming out . the only thing that is “ bad ” in cholesterol is oxidized ldl , not hdl or even ldl . weston price studied people eating massive amounts of saturated fat and cholesterol in places where their intake of high antioxidant foods kept the ldl from oxidizing . high ldl cholesterol is found in people with low rates of cancer.it is more important to our health than hdl . in fact , studies where they raised hdl increased stroke risk so much they had to stop the testing . the oils they try to push on you , unsaturated ( polyunsaturated ) are in fact the quickest to oxidize and become rancid . rancid oil can make ldl bad . there is so much to it , and this desperate attempt by the nature folks to tell you they were wrong for decades condemning non-oxidized ldl and saturated fat is sad to watch.eat a low meat diet , include coconut oil in place of polyunsaturated oils . it ’ s a source of energy , doesn ’ t clog arteries , and the high medium chain triglyceride oil does not go rancid , even at room temperature storage for long periods . in fact , it keeps nearby unsaturated fats from rancidity . get a lot of anti oxidants from healthy fruits and vegetables or supplements . eat low glycemic load foods . high glycemic high calorie diets are the top cause of weight gain and that resulting fat storage caused by too many simple carbs is the top cause of heart disease and strokes.the video tries to say higher saturated fat intake raises ldl ( it calls “ bad ” ) as if it ’ s bad . but higher ldl levels are found in healthier people , ldl cholesterol is essential for our immune system , and those with higher ldl have lower cancer risk . oxidized ldl is what is bad , not getting enough anti oxidants in fruits / vegetables , or supplements to prevent oxidation , and high intake of rancid oils ( unsaturated oils go rancid , saturated oils like coconut do not ) oxidizes ldl . high simple carb / high glycemic diets are also a problem . eat low glycemic , high organic fruits and vegetables and fiber . eat low dairy and avoid meat in general ( but don ’ t abstain from it ) and try to get more safe fish ( low in mercury ) or take omega 3 fish oil supplements.dr. greger addressed ldl size in this video , if interested . ​ does ldl size matter ? thanks for your comments , mark ! excellent video . thank you dr. greger.okay , but one thing that those that rec. saturated fat recently have stated , which i agree with , is the negative effects of all the vegetable oils that are often extracted with hexane . so then are we supposed to have no fats ? fat is a necessary ingredient for a host of body functions , hormone regulation , etc … so what ’ s left ? right . vegetable oils are not healthful be it the hexane or the rancidity or the fact they are pure fat with no fiber and little antioxidants , if any . nuts , seeds , avocado , olives , coconut flakes , etc are fibrous plant sources of fat containing antioxidants so those could be a choice , as you are correct fat is a necessary component of the diet . keep in mind even beans , grains , and leafy greens have fat just in smaller amounts , which appears to be the advantageous . we really do not need much fat in the diet.great suggestions . i guess it really boils down to not having any processed foods in the diet . including even the supposed ‘ healthy ’ options for chips and crackers . i have zero meat , but still some cheese and yogurt , but i will look at that as well . thanks for the information.study : saturated fatty acids may directly damage your heart : http : / / www.science20.com / news _ articles / saturated _ fatty _ acids _ may _ directly _ damage _ your _ heart-155141i kinda understand the dogma of cholesterol . i see it as though plaque build up starts as early as childhood . if you as a child and even into your younger years have high cholesterol , the damage is done then . then later in life you start a healthier lifestyle or by accident just choose a healthier diet , you still have the reprecussions of what you did in early life . then when these individuals have cardiac events , whats recorded is the now . the cholesterol is good . the saturated fat intake is minimal as recorded . the given is they had already done what was needed as far as plaque and then given that age progresses smaller arteries , you get recorded as a healythy lifestyle but had an cardiac event . i dont know this as fact , but i do know from medical journals that state that arteriosclerosis starts in your youth . i remember the guy that started the running revolution for better health and lifestyle and wrote many books on running , died of a ha while running . even though he had changed his lifestyle , he had been a chronic smoker and overweight most of his life into middle adult hoodhello , i have seen your videos on the ‘ saturated fats study ’ . one question that i believe is worth addressing is the effect of grass fed non-pasteurized milk and its relation to the negative effects of saturated fat consumption.many pro raw milk enthusiasts claim that the butterfat from organic grass-fed non-pasteruized milk is substantially different than normal everyday butter . the differences include a claimed significant great amount of vitamin k2 , omega 3 fatty acids , and conjugated linoleic acid ( cla ) ; all of which apparently mitigate , and even improve heart health.can you speak to this claimed difference ? thanksi wonder , maybe it ’ s you who refuses to accept that you were wrong and not the people who designed these studies . here is another one for you , and this one isn ’ t sponsored by any “ big butter ” industry : https : / / news.osu.edu / news / 2014 / 11 / 21 / study-doubling-saturated-fat-in-the-diet-does-not-increase-saturated-fat-in-blood / how about you show a study that saturated fat increases the number of heart attacks , not just ldl cholesterol ( because while it increases ldl-c it also increases hdl and decreases ldl-p ) , but actually reduces the number of heart attacks . you cannot . there was only one old population study that did it , but it was very flawed because it selected the countries for comparison that supported that saturated fat is bad , and deliberately omitted countries like france and skandinavian countries where consumption of saturated fat was higher but the number of heart attacks is lower . the truth is – there is zero evidence that saturated fat is bad . ” this one isn ’ t sponsored by any “ big butter ” industry ” actually it ’ s supported by a lot more than big butter . here ’ s the study : http : / / journals.plos.org / plosone / article ? id = 10.1371 / journal.pone.0113605 “ funding : this work was funded by a grant from dairy research institute , the beef checkoff , the egg nutrition center , and the robert c. and veronica atkins foundation . ” as for the study itself , the industry funded researches took diabetics and played around with amount of ( presumably refined ) carbs in their diet , and found that circulating levels of saturated fat were similar even when dietary saturated fat was lower . these lines from the study explain the findings : “ a consequence of consuming dietary sugars and starches above levels that can be directly oxidized is that a greater proportion is converted to fat ( i.e. , de novo lipogenesis ) . isocaloric high-carbohydrate diets [ 4 ] and high-carbohydrate meals [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] also promote dnl and hypertriglyceridemia in individuals with insulin resistance . the major product of dnl is palmitate ( 16 : 0 ) , a saturated fatty acid ( sfa ) , ” so the industry funded researchers did their study by feeding junk food to people who have a disease that doesn ’ t allow them to process glucose properly , then noted that this caused them to produce high amounts of saturated fat from the carbohydrates they were fed . the concern raised by the study essentially admits that high circulating levels of saturated fat is a bad thing , but they still try to make a high saturated fat diet sound like the winner.as for that “ old population study , ” this article can clear things up for youhttp : / / plantpositive.com / blog / 2014 / 6 / 28 / how-time-magazine-sacrificed-its-standards-to-promote-satura.htmlthe work of ancel keys obviously isn ’ t the only studies scientists have considered to say that saturated fat is bad for you , but it ’ s worth clearing up how that study was actually conducted . certain countries were excluded from the final analysis because their data simply wasn ’ t reliable / usable . keys also dropped data from some countries that would have supported his fat hypothesis because he knew it might be flawed and skew his results . you need to have some skepticism when you read the claims of the saturated fat deniers . they don ’ t give an accurate view of the science.dr greger , i ’ m not sure i ’ m following your logic : you are saying that there is great variability between different people in their ldl levels . well , if this is the case , then people with genetically low ldl baseline , can safely eat saturated fat ? if the noise is so large that you cannot observe health as a function of the saturated fat intake , it means that a lot of people can enjoy croissant … they just have to check their baseline ldl before . i ’ m not sure that ’ s what you meant to present. animal fat , atkins diet , butter , calories , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cheese , chicken ,

PLAIN-2509	chicken big : poultry and obesity we know vegetarians have considerable lower obesity rates compared to meat-eaters , but why ? is it because they ’ re not eating meat or because they ’ re eating more plants ? or maybe they ’ re just eating fewer calories or exercising more ? this study controlled for all that.in essence they took men and women who ate the same number of calories a day , ate the same amount of vegetables , and fruit and grains , same amount of exercise — but , ate different amounts of meat . men and women who ate less than a small serving of meat a day were on average not overweight , but the more meat they ate the heavier they were and by one and a half servings a day , they crossed the threshold of a bmi of 25 to become officially classified as overweight.which type of meat was the worst ? if you remember back to that study of hundreds of thousands of men and women poultry consumption appeared to be the worst , but maybe it was reverse causation , meaning obesity lead to greater chicken consumption and not the other way around . this new study controlled for that , adjusting for dieting habits , yet found the same thing . chicken consumption was most associated with weight gain in both men and women . and it didn ’ t take much . compared to those who didn ’ t eat any chicken at all , those eating about 20 or more grams of chicken a day had a significantly greater increase in their body mass index . that ’ s around one chicken nugget . or a single chicken breast once every two weeks , compared to no chicken at all. and how does eating chicken cause obesity ? is it due to the hormones the chickens are fed ? see doctor ’ s note section just below the transcript for links which look at this questionthanks for pointing that out robert ! thanks roberta couple of years ago , my neighbor switched to a paleo diet ( despite my warnings ) , and eats meat ( mostly meat ) three times a day , including bacon and eggs for breakfast . he lost 20 lbs , and claims he feels better than ever . i keep wondering if some day a time bomb will go off in his body . meanwhile , how do we explain this weight loss ? lower carbs equals less sugar equals lower insulin equals more fat burning . i ’ ve lost 10 lbs on a paleo diet , with a better lipid profile and more energy . millions of people experience the same effect . i eat grassfed / organic meat whenever possible . and while i miss the carbs , i love the eggs , butter and meat ! i know that ’ s heresy here but at least for me it works.the taubesian carbs → insulin → fat gain hypothesis has been thoroughly debunked by a multitude of sources . here ’ s just onehttp : / / carbsanity.blogspot.com / 2014 / 12 / insulin-doesnt-regulate-fat-mass.html ? m = 1luckily , when it comes to paleo / lowcarb diets , no one is really concerned with the science . its all “ good news about bad habits , and nothing you show me to the contrary will ever sway my beliefs ” .do the research and go for a vegan whole food plant based diet and you ’ ll feel a lot better . after a period of gaining some weight that is . the paleo diet causes severe harm to your metabolism . i bet there are people over here that can help you get of that horrible diet.there ’ s a certainty that borders on arrogance when someone confidently prescribes a diet for a person they know nothing about.metabolic individuality is a basic – and unchallenged – reality . some people thrive on carbs , others on animal products etc . just look at the varied diets followed by traditional peoples . they ranged from almost entirely fat to entirely carb , and most were healthier than people are today.my doctor – whose nutritional prescriptions cure cancer in hundreds of people – says that i do best on a diet with lots and lots of varied vegetables and moderate amounts of clean beef , fish , poultry , eggs and dairy . it ’ s cured me of metastatic cancer and as i said earlier makes me feel great , while improving my blood work.i follow this site avidly as i learn much from dr geiger that i apply in my diet . but the absolute belief that animal products are bad for everyone is – with all due respect – absurd.just read the stories of the multitudes of former vegans whose health improved after leaving the diet.if you feel great as a vegan that ’ s fantastic . i have no desire or interest in challenging you . all i ask is that you – and other true believers – respect my experience and do the same with people like me.nonsense. you don ’ t even know how to spell the man ’ s name . if you ’ d really heard what he says you ’ d go vegan . there is no group of people who benefit from eating meat.your reply is utterly predictable . first attack me on an irrelevancy – that i made a typo . then distort what i said by saying that if i hear what he says i ’ d be vegan . well i do and i ’ m not . then you assert an absolute – no group benefits from meat – without even a scintilla of evidence . because there is no evidence that everyone benefits from veganism . nice job ! you ’ re selectively closing your eyes . the evidence is on this very website.and a typo usually means you mistype one character ; you mistyped three . don ’ t you hate it when people misspell your name ? or do you think that ’ s irrelevant too ? show me even one properly done large study that shows that every single person would benefit from a vegan diet over a non vegan diet . if you can do that i ’ ll become a vegan ! dear herb , you are using to the nirvana falacy . this site is completely loaded with excellent studies that show the benefits of a plant based diet and the disadvantages of eating animal product . but only if veganism is 100 % perfect for 100 % of the human population will you change ? why don ’ t you try a whole food plant based diet for month and then see if it is good for _ you _ ? best of lucksome time ago i tried a whole food plant based diet for much more than a month and i felt quite unwell . so i went to a doctor who specializes in nutrition and after some sophisticated testing and clinical judgment he put me a balanced diet – lots of veggies and moderate amounts of animal protein . he finds that the majority of his patients do much better on a balanced diet than on a vegan diet – and he ’ s seen thousands of patients . i am thriving on this diet – feel great and blood tests reflect that.so many vegans treat their eating philosophy as it were a religion . unless they ’ re converting people they feel like they are letting their religion down . well there are many religions in the world just as there are many dietary traditions , and no one religion or dietary tradition has been able to prove it ’ s the only right path despite the efforts of their true believers.the second paragraph is really uncalled for . there is no scientific evidence for any religion and there is a shipload of scientific evidence and logical reasons for veganism . if you would be convinced eating stones would be a benefit for you i wouldn ’ t mind at all but you are eating animals . they also have lives and also want to live and be treated with respect incase you forgot.so please tell me how you felt unwell , and what you speficically need from meat which cannot be found in plants + a few supplements that would be in and on the plants if they were grown on a healthy soil.what exactly are you asking for herb ? randomized controlled trials involving thousands of people is simply impossible and doesn ’ t exist . we don ’ t even have that kind of evidence against smoking cigarettes . if you are asking for a study in which 100 % of people benefited on such a large scale that is also not possible . these types of standards are too high for a population bases where there are many variables that may be unaccounted for . there is much evidence of significantly lower rates of chronic disease amongst vegans and vegetarians . “ mortality from all-cause , ischemic heart disease , and circulatory and cerebrovascular diseases was significantly lower in vegetarians than in omnivorous populations . compared with omnivores , the incidence of cancer and type 2 diabetes was also significantly lower in vegetarians . ” http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1002 / jsfa.6362 / abstract ” our results suggest that vegetarians have a significantly lower ischemic heart disease mortality ( 29 % ) and overall cancer incidence ( 18 % ) than nonvegetarians . ” http : / / www.karger.com / article / fulltext / 337301 “ vegetarians had a 32 % lower risk ( hr : 0.68 ; 95 % ci : 0.58 , 0.81 ) of ihd than did nonvegetarians , which was only slightly attenuated after adjustment for bmi and did not differ materially by sex , age , bmi , smoking , or the presence of ihd risk factors . ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 97 / 3 / 597.full “ vegetarian diets are associated with lower all-cause mortality and with some reductions in cause-specific mortality . ” http : / / archinte.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ?

articleid = 1386610first thanks for those links . i – like so many others – recoil at the absolutist mentality of so many vegans . that ’ s what i ’ m asking for – a bit of humility and tolerance . no one diet is best for everyone. it ’ s as simple as that . as far as these studies go count me a skeptic as to the need to totally eliminate all animal products from the diet . vegans and vegetarians generally have much better health habits than do omnivores and it ’ s extremely difficult to control for all those factors in a trial.i ’ d love to see an rct comparing a paleo / low carb diet to a vegan diet for cvd patients . i personally think that as long as one is eating plenty of varied vegetables and nuts healthy animal protein is not harmful for most people . i don ’ t believe that trial has ever been done . if i ’ m wrong i ’ d appreciate finding out from someone.it is good to be a skeptic . i think you would appreciate and take interest in some of the biological implications of consuming animal products . those here who have been with nf for a long time and who have seen much of the research contained in the videos come to realize that animal products can never truly be defined as a “ healthy ” meat , but perhaps a condiment to a largely plant based diet . the reason that animal products may cause harm is not unknown . please see here for some of the biochemical implications. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-exogenous-endotoxin-theory / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ?

al : i ’ m not sure what your question is . but if you are thinking that eskimos and massai are examples of people who thrive on meat , it is actually a myth . people from those native cultures which consume a lot of meat do not live very long generally due to the harsh conditions in which they live . but even by the time they reach the early ages in which they die , the people show signs of heart disease . we even see this in ancient mummies who could not have been influenced by modern diets / products.here is a copy of a post from “ xfjea ” that is very helpful : “ the idea of excellent cardiovascular health among inuits is probably based on inaccurate data . see this review from 2003 : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12535749 ” and here is what graham wrote : “ autopsy data on pre-westernised inuit shows lots of data for atherosclerosis in the inuit. http : / / www.meandmydiabetes.com / wp-content / uploads / 2010 / 03 / atherosclerosis-in-pre-westernized-inuit.pdf ” if this topic interests you , plant positive has some wonderful details and source materials on the topic . search for words on the following link / page such as : masai , alaska , eskimo , etc . then click the links to watch the videos . you can also click in his search box for “ inuit ” . or even better , go to the top of the list of the “ primitive nutrition ” series and watch the whole thing . : - ) it ’ s * very * educational. http : / / plantpositive.com / hope that helps.i am a long time vegan but i agree with herb here . body ’ s are different . some thrive on vegan and some on flesh . check out the blood type dietnick : i think you will be interested to learn that there is no scientific evidence to support the blood type diet . you can learn more here : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / blood-type-diet-debunked / also , i ’ m not aware of a body of scientific evidence which supports the theory that “ bodies ” thrive on flesh . instead , the evidence tells us that some people can get away with consuming flesh – much like some people can get away with smoking all of their adult lives and not seem to face any of the serious consequences most of the rest of face if we take up smoking . that ’ s doesn ’ t make smoking healthy … thea , that is very good info . thank you love ! han , i appreciate your fervor . i ’ m happy you ’ re doing well on wfpbd.however , denying reality for some does a disservice to the objective of getting more fruits , veggies , nuts , seeds , legumes , and intact whole grains into ppl ’ s diets . not everyone thrives on a wfpb diet even when it ’ s properly planned.i would recommend letting go of diet dogma and check out the website of vegan registered dietitian jack norris who has been grappling with this real phenomenon.http : / / jacknorrisrd.com / vegetarian-recidivism-survey / there are those who wish to eat 100 % wfpb but can ’ t . have some empathy for them , please.an eloquintly formulated claim . can you give me an example of such a group of people ? did you or did you not go to jack norris ’ s website ? how about this ? find me a blue zone populated entirely by strict vegetarians.i ’ m sorry , but that ’ s a lot of data . can you provide me with a concrete link that confirms your claim ? a single blog post is “ too much data ” for you ? why are you spending time on dr. greger ’ s website if not for data ? i ’ m still waiting for that 100 % vegan blue zone.well i read the jack norris website which states that people who quit veganism do it for the flimsyest of reasons so i assumed that was a mistake on your behalf . and i don ’ t know what you try to say with a “ 100 % vegan blue zone , ” how is that relevant for your argumentation ? flimsy ? hrc sounds pleased that only 29 % experienced ill health – but that ’ s almost one-third of people who tried the diet . i was actually hoping to find out that , say , only 1 % of former vegetarians experienced poor health because it would allow me to retire from my nutrition work that , while being a labor of love , is indeed a labor , and takes away from my other efforts . at almost 1 out of 3 people , i ’ m not so sure it ’ s time to cross the finish line and declare victory.if you weren ’ t so focused on argumentation and diet dogma , you might ’ ve noticed that phrase “ ill health ” . you call that flimsy ? all i ’ m asking is that you humble your viewpoint just a little , just to the point where you can admit that there are people who want to be vegans or vegetarians and just can ’ t be … or like myself can ’ t be any longer … because their health was suffering.have a little respect for your elder and more experienced wfpbers.consider reading the whole story , and not just a part of it.incidentally , jack norris is no slouch in the plant-based world . he is co-author of vegan for life with ginny messina of http : / / theveganrd.comhttp : / / www.amazon.com / vegan-life-everything-healthy-plant-based / dp / 0738214930 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 ? ie = utf8 & qid = 1332182475 & sr = 8-1i ’ m not familiar with the dietitian you link to so i ’ ll have to read about him , but want to add that in the spirit of improving health , it ’ s small changes we make to a lifetime of less-than-ideal eating habits that help one learn about their own health and get in touch with how food makes them feel.in intonation-less message board replies , sometimes good intentions ( e.g. eat this way and you ’ ll be healthier ) can be perceived as scolding one ’ s eating choices . it ’ s unrealistic that a person will suddenly drop what they ’ ve always known and overhaul their diet ( let alone that of an entire family ) overnight or in a week or even in a few months . it ’ s taken me well over a decade to get to a place where i function well in a mostly wfpb home kitchen – purchasing new equipment / tools and taking time to learn new foods , spices and preparations that i didn ’ t learn growing up … and i still am not 100 % wfpb every day , i doubt i ever will be and that ’ s ok.the last statement above , “ there are those who wish to eat 100 % wfpb but can ’ t … ” resonates with me because it ’ s true . i ’ m not yet versed in metabolic differences when it comes to diet but undoubtedly from a logistics perspective there are many people who would love to eat healthier but getting to even 30 % wfpb each day is a tall order of change in the context of their life ( routines , expenses , knowledge ) and so they really never start.better to encourage small changes maybe not so much as percentages but rather as positive behaviors . the nf.org format of focusing on specific nutrition / health topics has been effective and empowering in my life , without shaming , and as a result has motivated some fantastic dietary behavioral changes . thanks , dr. greger ! i hear ya ! in my case , i was veg * n for 20 + years . adding animal products back into my diet due to food sensitivities slashing the absolute amount and variety of plant foods i could eat was a necessity , and it was not a decision i undertook willingly or happily . han ’ s arrogance is vegan zealotry i was once guilty of myself . it is disturbingly unattractive.after reading your comment i am left wondering if the issues you mention weren ’ t precisely those food sensitivities ? just because you would eat a wfpb diet , doesn ’ t mean you would get along right with everything , there might be a lot of things that won ’ t go right for different people because of any underlying problems.yet i am highly skeptical that animal products would do much for you at all , because they are very much devoid of any nutrients ( you cannot take , where there isn ’ t ) and instead are full of toxins , and hormones that are far from beneficial . again would be a miracle if nocive or downright dangerous components could help your health.there were ( and there are ) smokers who keep claiming they feel physically better if they smoke . but there isn ’ t any evidence to it , in fact just the opposite . placebo effect can take people * very * far.i repeat , food sensitivities slash [ ed ] the absolute amount and variety of plant foods i could eatwhich prevented me from getting enough of an important macronutrient called protein ( verified by bloodwork ) .all the antioxidants and micronutrients in the world do you little good if you die from a lack of essential macronutrients . you have to eat for survival . dead ppl can not advocate for any diet.eating animal products does not make me feel good in any way , and it causes its own set of side effects , even keeping it down to 10 % of calories à la fuhrman.placebo ? tobacco ? give me a judgmental break . although you mean well , thule , you don ’ t know how presumptuous and rude that analogy sounds . i shudder to think i used to say such insensitive things to my friends and relatives.sorry , no bad intention there.ok i see you aren ’ t keen on a diet that includes animals , and the major issues was protein . but as you know many doctors think we need far more protein than the actual need . in fact , the protein profile of animal products is problematic , please check this to begin with : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / methionine-restriction-as-a-life-extension-strategy / doctors were formed under the mantra of the extreme importance of protein , and under the now proved false assumption that only meat had all the aminoacids.it is impossible for anyone to eat the amount of calories they need per day , and no get the quantity of protein they need . it has been more than proved.and lastly , it would be in fact good if you keep low in certain problematic aminoacids.what do i have to do , thule ? violate my own privacy by posting my bloodwork just to satisfy your ocd over my diet ? the fact was i had to restrict both the variety and absolute amount of plants that i could consume , and that prevented me from taking in enough calories , and therefore , the minimum amount of protein and other nutrients an adult body needs just on the plants that were left over.not only did my blood work indicate a problem , but i did the math according to dr. greger ’ s videos on protein requirements.please stop countering my comments with points and videos i ’ ve already watched and accepted as fact . you don ’ t know what you don ’ t know , and i have to live in the real world . ( just one question , do you have issues with all legumes ? ) because outside the western world there are many that are mostly unknown here , for example see mung daal that i was recommending to another person here.this is given to babies and sick people , because is highly tolerated . but there are more options beyond . in any case , good luck . hope you get better.such an enlightening discussion thread . if we can get people to eat mostly plants , that is a big step in itself . as a future rd , i need to be wary of making dogmatic claims and really focus on the individual . as in your situation , sensitivities limiting consumption of the proper macro nutrients due to food allergies is a greater concern and trumps strict wfpb . and in your case , with your knowledge , i assume your diet is filled with plenty of plant foods along with small amounts of animal products to sustain macro nutrient needs . i look forward to reading the jack norris article . may i ask , what allergies and sensitivities do you have that prevented you from consuming enough food ? i ask purely out of curiosity and not to look for “ solutions ” .thank you for your respectful reply , toxins . i appreciate your acknowledging my background . i ’ ve been frequenting dr. g ’ s site and watching his videos for years . in fact , it was one of his videos which helped me pin down one of my apparent widely-encompassing sensitivities.i also appreciate your acknowledging proper nutritional priorities.in this day and age of ubiquitous data mining ( even emails e.g. , gmail ) , i am not willing to disclose every issue i have on the internet . i have several conditions , all of which affect my food options . at this point , i ’ m really getting tired of the restrictions , especially since i am also intolerant of many supplements . ok with b-12 and dha , but can ’ t take even a multivitamin without repercussions . very frustrating.so i ’ m now reintroducing some foods , doing my best to evaluate them individually instead of as a group , reintroducing them in varying amounts to see if they can be permanent residents of my diet , which amounts and frequency.i sure wish it were as simple as “ just eat wfpbd ” , but it ’ s just not , when almost all plants contain the component that causes me the most trouble . if wishes were fishes … it ’ s the typical “ sensitive snowflake ” troll . tried veganism , no details about why he has to eat meat , just take his word for it.i have a friend that has colitis . was doing well on his way of eating but not totally vegan . he had hernia surgery this year and that set off the colitis and he is really struggling with what he can eat . legumes are a no because of the skins . whole grains are too irritating . is there a plant based diet for colitis ? my heart goes out to your friend , jj . as i just told thule , you have to eat for survival . if that means eating more digestible processed or animal foods , that may be a necessity . perhaps this will be a temporary issue.how well does your buddy tolerate a fermented legume product like tofu or vegetarian “ meats ” like seitan , qorn , or boca products ? if i ’ m not mistaken , dr. fuhrman ’ s eat for life book has a protocol for inflammatory bowel disease . perhaps he can give that a try.i wish you both well ! ! he is hoping that this is temporary and can get back to a more varied diet . he used to like tofu recipes my sister fixed but she isn ’ t able to do that anymore . not sure what recipe he might want to try himself as he is a beginner cook . i don ’ t cook with tofu anymore just because it takes more fixing to be palatable . i prefer whole foods simply prepared . can ’ t remember about quorn or boca , depends on how they are spiced . he does like books so will look for eat for life for him . thanks . “ you have to eat for survival ” i agree with that . each person has individual struggles / issues and must do the best they can manage for their body . i used to think there was only the vegan way of life but have come to modify my thinking.did your friend try red lentils ? they are skinless and cooked to a mush . very digestible.but here the legume that are given to babies : http : / / healthytips-foryou.blogspot.com / 2013 / 02 / benefits-of-split-moong-dal.htmlof course get the skinless version . they cook very quickly , and also get cooked to a mush.but i must say that for colitis , your friend should try lactobacillus acidophilus ( only ) not other organism for now . l. acidophilus is homofermentative which means that the only byproduct it forms from fermentation is lactic acid . ( no other by-products as gasses , which are produced by other lactobacillus species which aren ’ t homofermentative ) l. acidophilus ncfm produces a bacteriocin , called lactacin b that demonstrates antimicrobial activity against other lactobacilli and enterococcus faecalis.a brand that i recommend is this : ww.amazon.co.uk / solgar-advanced-acidophilus-non-dairy-vegetable-capsules / dp / b008q59rog / ref = sr _ 1 _ 22 ?

ie = utf8 & qid = 1332182475 & sr = 8-1is it possible that you have done well because you have increased your consumption of vegetables ? the two good things that are on the paleo diet are vegetables and nuts as well as fruits . fruits , vegetables and nuts are correlated with good health in many studies . i don ’ t eat any meat , or as little as possible , because even if it is “ grass fed ” the slaughtering process is always an ugly thing . however , people in okinawa eat * some * meat and still live a long time . no culture that consumes a lot of meat , such as the inuit are long lived . from a scientific point of view , i would say a person could eat up to 10 % of their calories from non processed meat and still be healthy . the typical “ paleo ” diet consists of 65 % of calories being derived from animal products , which is far more than is healthy . besides , eating tons of meat is hard on the digestive system.eating any meat , in my estimation , if one has a choice is not kind at all . maybe “ grass fed ” is not quite as cruel , but it still is for meat . most people can do well on a vegan diet if they make sure they get their nutrients . i remember one woman who claimed she didn ’ t do well on a vegan diet because she became vitamin d deficient . however , the sun is a good source , as well as mushrooms exposed to ultraviolet light . if a person cannot make their own creatine ( most people can create their own , but some can ’ t ) , then supplements are available . b12 can be derived from natural bacterial cultures . before you assume you are healthy , you should get an angiogram , which would tell whether you had plaque build up in your arteries from all the animal products you consume . blood tests don ’ t always show plaque build up . in my case , i had colon polyps five years ago ( i got the colonoscopy because the stool test indicated blood ) , and thought i did not develop any additional polyps since subsequent stool tests showed no blood . however , today , i got the colonscopy and still had two additional polyps . i also once had a cracked tooth , which x rays won ’ t show . i had to go to an endodontist to diagnose this and then get the root canal from her . so , you can ’ t always tell just by blood tests whether you are completely healthy or not . more invasive procedures can tell that.meat eaters … so defensive . a meat diet may not do you any harm but it does the planet and of course the actual animals loads of harm . i am not vegan btw . i just don ’ t eat meat , fish , dairy or eggs because i know the harm it does.if you don ’ t eat meat , fish , dairy or eggs , what animal product does that leave for you to eat if you are not vegan ? the term “ vegan ” can often include a moral philosophy beyond diet and health : no leather shoes , no handbags , or other products made of or by animals ( honey ) . thus the term whole foods plant-based diet was devised.honey too is an animal product.honey is just sugar , so it ’ s not healthy. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-healthiest-sweetener / blossom , your reply about the harm done through consumption of animal products takes a very narrow view . like a lot of folks i raise backyard chickens . the birds roam the property freely and i take and use the eggs they produce daily . trust me , they do not miss them and the eggs if left would be destroyed by vermin and the chickens themselves . make some room in your philosophy for the many good folks who produce and use animal products humanely.eggman : while backyard chickens are a step ( or two ) up from other farmed chickens , there are still a set of serious ethical and environmental problems with backyard chicken operations . i don ’ t want to spend the time explaining it all to you as i don ’ t think this is the place ( my personal opinion ) . however , if you are interested , i highly recommend watching the movie , cowspiracy for a beginning / beginner ’ s look at the issues in a manner that is entertaining.thea , did you read about the cow that jumped a 6-foot fence to get away from certain death at a slaughterhouse ? who knew they could do that ? ? too bad it ended in her death anyway.http : / / seattle.cbslocal.com / 2014 / 12 / 16 / cow-idaho-slaughterhouse-police / macsmiley : thanks , yes . i ’ ve heard about cows that do that . there is also a video out there of a girl who wanted a horse , but her parent ’ s gave her a cow . so , she trained it to give her rides and jump hurdles . i ’ ve also seen a video of rescued dairy cows who jumped for joy after being released into a field . i ’ ve also read a story about a cow who made a sophie ’ s choice with her twins . incredible , true story in one of the books karen pryor wrote . the same book has a story about the grown , male head of a “ natural ” cow herd who has lunch with his mother every day . ( they form life-long familial bonds . ) cows are truly amazing with inner lives that i would guess are equal too or more advanced than our dogs.i ’ ve also heard a lot of amazing stories about chickens . for example , one of my friends taught her chicken to “ sit ” on cue.the more i learn about the inner lives of non-human animals ( from both anecdotes and scientific evidence ) , the more i feel awe and respect for them – and an obligation to treat them ethically.of course , we can ’ t forgetmike the headless chickenhttp : / / en.m.wikipedia.org / wiki / mike _ the _ headless _ chickenwow . just wow . now * that ’ s * a new one for me . : -othe first time i ever heard of mike was in a program i saw on pbs entitled , the natural history of the chicken . it ’ s on youtube.http : / / youtu.be / nkxo91tlkvgthat ’ s the link for part 1 , but the story about mike is in parts 4 and 5 . i wouldn ’ t have believed it if i hadn ’ t seen it with my own “ eyes ” ! ! part 4 / 6 http : / / youtu.be / nao1hdmgjswpart 5 / 6 http : / / youtu.be / mjfu8mjmek0enjoy ! ! ! it ’ s amazing what animals can do . here ’ s another exemple : http : / / www.goodnewsnetwork.org / heroic-monkey-saves-dying-friend-kanpur-train-station / they are sensitive and so , for me , they deserve our respect.saw that on tv . jaw-dropping ! http : / / www.theecologist.org / investigations / food _ and _ farming / 268902 / humanitys _ worst _ invention _ agriculture.htmlthea , i ’ ll certainly look at your recommended source . your answer seems to indicate an interest in the environment . as such i ’ ve supplied the link above to give you food for thought on the cost to the planet to bring vegetables to the table . the most interesting assertion is that agriculture is the original cause of war . talk about your ethical dilemma.eggman : i took a look at the article . i didn ’ t read it in detail , but i think i skimmed it enough to get the gist of the points . my opinion is that the guy makes no sense and is missing a bunch of key points . but if you want to argue for the moment that agriculture has a big cost to the environment and humanity ( without qualifying that appropriately ) , then you have to stay away from meat , dairy and eggs more than ever – especially if you want to avoid war . they explain why in the movie i recommended , cowspiracy.for a less entertaining and perhaps harder to follow explanation ( and one that may not address backyard chickens ( i can ’ t remember ) , so you may not be interested ) , you might check out the following lecture . the benefit of this lecture is that it is free : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = fws0f9s4bas & feature = youtu.beif you ever get a chance to watch cowspiracy , i would be curious to hear what you think . only a section of the movie addresses backyard chickens , but since you linked to the article above , it is possible that the entire cowspiracy movie would interest you.many people also do well smoking cigarettes & some live to late 90s smoking a pack a day and lots of alcohol consumption too . but on the whole population there is a direct correlation between cancer and smoking that cannot be denied . also many fat people live very long productive lives . it ’ s all based on probability and chance . eggs contain the highest amount of cholesterol . cholesterol is associated with stroke , heart attack and many other diseases . also consider innocent animals getting caged , tortured & butchered for your beliefs and the possibility that you may be wrong . “ i love the eggs , butter and meat ” is just like saying i love cholesterol , fat and dead flesh . whatever spin you put on this one , it ain ’ t good for your tubes and senses mate . ( 1 ) getting rid of non-satiating , hyper absorbable junk carbs and other processed foods engineered for hyperpalatability ( 2 ) protein consumption can be satiating . both circumstances leads to fewer calories actually consumed → weight loss.it ’ s not rocket science . paleo is basically a low carb diet dressed up in a bearskin.good point macsmiley , while carbs go down and are depleted , protein and fat goes up , which is very satiating when consumed in high amounts , which , as you said , hunger and calories also go down , which leads to short term weight loss , but people don ’ t even consider the long term effects on their body systems , like clogging their arteries and damaging their gi tract.true.forgot one other reason : for initial weight loss in lc / paleo diets also is caused by the depletion of the water molecules bound to glycogen that ’ s also lost .. dr. greger addresses this in vol 22 : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 12 / 09 / dr-greger-addresses-saturated-fat-confusion-in-new-dvd / or since the video on paleo is # 8 and this is video # 6 , we can just wait until the end of the week until # 8 goes up on the website.i believe your neighbor ’ s weight loss is best explained by understanding calorie density of foods . of course as pointed out by many video ’ s on this site there are many factors correlated with weight problems ranging from possible viruses to hormones to persistent organic pollutants . the best resource for understanding calorie density is jeff novick ’ s presentation , calorie density : how to eat more , weigh less and live longer . the nice thing about jeff ’ s presentation is he links calorie density to exercise . another resource is dr. mcdougall ’ s excellent article for his monthly newsletter entitled , the fat vegan … see december 2008 via his website . the more animal products you consume the more risk you take on in acquiring many conditions linked to them . you can check out the calorie density of foods by using the website , cron-0-meter . select food , enter g for grams and 454 for number and hit enter the number of calories will give you the calorie density of that particular food ( i.e. calories / pound ) . you do this and you can explain your neighbors success . of course some of the subjective feelings of “ feeling great ” can be do to the consumption of animal products either through direct absorption of casomorphins or hormones or the production of endogenous morphines or other factors.chicken is more fattening than red meat ? chicken has about the same or maybe a little more cholesterol than red meat , but much less saturated fat. total fat , and less calories . it is clear , from this study , that eating chicken is fattening far out of proportion to its calories . are there things that are the opposite ? things that have a lot of calories but are slimming ? yes , nuts and dark chocolate can be slimming . i think dr. greger here boldly claims that being vegan is important for long life , already saying that milk makes people overweight . the science of being vegan is so strong it seems it perplexes many doctors . dr. greger does not suggest that red meat is healthy , knowing the animal saturated fats in it are a cause of ms , fibromaylgia , and other nerve related disorders , dr , greger is suggesting here that meat and animal product is the source of disease in the world . killing is the cause of harm in life , and freedom from guilt of killing can ease the mind into health . i was long hoping dr. greger would suggest a safe amount of meat to eat , which seems to be none . oprah advocated a beef and pork ( red meat ) free diet , only poultry . she received death threats from the beef industry . i think that she had studied her diet and found it was healthier . apparently , not healthy enough . perhaps we could adjust the bmi to be more reasonable because no one in the country is thin enough to pass it , except vegans , and they represent less than one percent of the country.do the same effects result from eating chicken broth or bouillon ? dr. caldwell esselstyn has demonstrated that all animal products ( and oils ) build arterial plaque . so in my mind it does not matter how much weight you lose or how much more better you think you feel , arterial plaque is arterial plaque . let ’ s go get some ! would you klndly refer me to the peer reviewed study by esselstyn – or anyone else – that shows that all animal products build up plaque in everyone ? i ’ ve never seen such a study so please enlighten me . thank you.dr. michael greger has also conveyed numerous times through his videos that animal products promote the growth of human cancer cells . the consumption of animal products is a ‘ fast track ’ to heart disease and cancer … the number one and number 2 causes of death in the western world.thank you . that is a very fair assessment . meat consumption , smoking , obesity , and a lack of exercise are the cause of illness in the western world . he is arguing here chicken causes obesity . i think fenugreek is a plant that can cure obesity , as is drinking tea , eating small fruits before meals , eating smaller meals , eating nuts , and drinking hibiscus tea . i think you are saying that dr. greger would agree meat causes metabolic syndrome or x syndrome . high blood pressure , diabetes , large waist line , high cholesterol , high triglycerides , and high bmi . he shows that the plant based diet is an effective treatment for this disease . he shows that this disease is a huge risk factor for any illness . how thin do you have to be to not get these diseases ? what is too much hunch ? he said a waistline which is half your height is desired . if i eat only plants will i have that ? i am too fat on the bmi and the waist measure scale . i was only that thin when i ran four miles a day . i am developing leg injuries and can ’ t seem to find the energy despite the fact that i walk much of the day . was it because i ate meat when i was younger ? anyone can be skinny if they don ’ t eat meat ? what do you do with the overweight vegetarians ? they can eat nuts , beans , matcha , berries , beans , whole grains , fruits , and vegetables , and the richest ones in terms of antioxidants for a fighting chance.i lost 74 lbs in 7 months embracing a 100 % ‘ live ’ plant-based-diet . the key word here is ‘ live ’ . nothing from a box , bottle , can , jar , bag , container , wrapper , or bag . i eat what i want , when i want , and as much as i want . i do not need to exercise to maintain my weight at 10 % body fat . however , i do exercise for other reasons . this was in 1991 , and still going strong today.we all cant eat 100 % ‘ live ’ plant-based-diet all the time . i live in a country in europe that get very cold in the winter and we have to buy frozen veggies and even candyou can still eat plant-based all the time . i live in a place that gets cold and i buy frozen veggies , but it ’ s still better than eating rotting carcasses ( aka meats ) . plus you can supplement with live plants by sprouting regularly in your house and eating the sprouts of beans and legumes.i do eat a 100 % plant based diet but cant get fresh live so i buy frozen and even canedlg king , thats great to hear , keep it up ! how come no one ever looks at the fact that most american poultry is full of hormones and antibiotics ? while it seems like it may be difficult to do , i ’ d like to see a comparison study or two that looks at consumption of poultry ( and meat ) raised with and without hormones and antibiotics . just seems like such a no-brainer to me.i have read the studies and looked at the discussion and find it very disappointing . its not natural foods that make you gain weight but ones that are grown with human intervention . take chicken as the example : no where in the study does it say that the chicken meat these people are eating is from free range ( true free range means no grain feeding or supplementing with anything but open spaces and naturally eating what they eat ) . so if they are eating the usual chicken meat supplied to humans then it is fed on a diet of gmo produce and the chickens themselves have been specifically manipulated in their breeding to produce more meat . so to get a real conclusion here you need to identify the source of the problem and not label it all as bad . what is reported in the video is bad science and does not help the cause . bits of studies presented as fact is misleading and downright dangerous to those not aware of all the details in a study and even the intent behind the study so lets present facts in full in the future and stop pushing individual beliefs of what they think a study is saying . its so full of holes it won ’ t hold water.paul and suzanne , thanks for bringing this up , as i have thought about this many times ! i opt to be vegan for many reasons , but in all fairness , our tainted and unnatural food supply , specifically regarding animals , needs to be studied separately from the traditional forms in order to fairly access their subsequent impact ! it is like comparing apples and oranges and isn ’ t relevant to those who do opt to include some animals in their diet . i just can ’ t fathom that a genetically altered un-chicken fed things that no normal chicken would chose to eat , in an environment no chicken would choose to occupy , is going to be the same nutritionally as a normal , naturally fed and raised , healthy chicken ! though as i said , i chose to avoid animal consumption , i still feel this is an extreme form of diet because i think as humans our natural food choices have always been opportunistic , hence our overwhelming “ success ” on this planet ! in nature , we ate whatever we could get into our bellies , without it killing us short term … but we have since “ evolved ” , eh ? lol ! it isn ’ t hard to extrapolate that the more unnatural our diets become , the more we suffer , and specifics aside , i think it is the biggest issue facing us and our declining health . we all know the huge benefits that eating a plant based diet gives us , there is no question we should all strive toward that goal , but i can ’ t imagine that the harm from eating some natural animal sources is in any way equivalent to consuming the totally disparate monstrosities foisted on us today ! it is a glaring oversight that only serves to muddy the issues , which is totally counter to what this site is all about ! thanks dr greger , for all you do ! i just wish it were you who designed these studies so we could know the whole truth ! the video i am seeing is about aromatherapy / peppermint. thanks for posting the video link for chicken and obesity.yikes , sorry about that ! we were having some youtube problems and so switched over to vimeo and looks like we had the wrong video cued up – so sorry ! will correct asap.i just clicked on the email for the chicken video but saw one on the affects of mint on performance … odd ? anyone else have this experience ? i was just trying to figure out what happened … thanks so much for posting ! anytime anything looks off please don ’ t hesitate to post or contact us asap.it seems like bmi would be a bad metric in that last study mentioned . people who eat chicken may have more muscle.since these studies were conducted prior to 2013 when roxarsone , carbarsone and arsanilic acid ( arsenic ) was routinely added to feed in order to have the animals gain greater weight . could be a plausible explanation.off topic : thanks very much for all these great videos . i ’ m curious about the healthiness or otherwise of several supplements that i have been taking : multi b ( i take b12 daily as well ) coq10 zinc magnesium creatine thanks again : ) bruce : i don ’ t necessarily have a direct answer for you . but i believe that nutritionfacts has an indirect answer at least . for example , here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . note which supplements are included and which are not : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / also , this website has several videos / articles on the general topic of supplements beyond what dr. greger recommends . usually the news is bad . here are some examples . you can draw lessons from these and apply it to your specific questions as you see fit. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / some-dietary-supplements-may-be-more-than-a-waste-of-money / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / antioxidant-vitamin-supplements / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-vitamin-c-pills-good-for-you / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / update-on-vitamin-e / here ’ s one on creatine itself : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / creatine-brain-fuel-supplementation / i ’ m not a doctor . you may have a specific condition that would make it wise to take one or more of the supplements you list . i ’ m just giving you general information . hope that helps.thanks thea . as i mentioned above , i have a brain tumour . i started taking these supplements mainly from my own internet “ research ” , not due to a recommendation from a cancer specialist . i think i ’ ll try dropping the dosage of the ones that are not clear yet , by half . and for the ones for which there is good information that it is bad for people , i ’ ll just drop it.i ’ m wondering if the studies about supplements and longevity adjust for people like myself , who start taking supplements * because * they are unwell ? thanks again : ) bruce : i ’ m sorry to hear about your tumor . dang . that ’ s way above my ability to comment / help . it seems to me that your approach is very reasonable and that you are trying to everything you can to help yourself in terms of doing the research and taking reasonable steps . i admire that . i ’ ll keep my fingers crossed for you.thanks : ) i tried to keep my fingers crossed , but it makes it very tricky to type ; ) the only supplement for the general population following a plant based diet is vitamin b12 . to understand the amounts you can view the series of 5 video ’ s that dr. greger posted in february 2012 . you can start with http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / vitamin-b12-recommendation-change / posted on february 3rd and view the others . as thea pointed out in her post there may be good reasons to take supplements but in general the track record for isolated supplements is not very good . you can watch videos on beta carotene , vitamin a and vitamin e to get the general idea . the physiologic and biochemical pathways in our bodies are so complex that it is difficult to fully evaluate the effects across all important areas . i would keep tuned as the science and recommendations keep changing and work with your physician ( s ) or other health care professionals as needed . happy holidays.thank you : ) i should have mentioned that i have a brain cancer ( anaplastic astrocytoma in the brain stem and cerebellum ) . i have watched most of the videos on this site now , and i get the idea that most supplements are better consumed as whole plant foods . my experience has been that conventional nutritionists don ’ t have a clue , and most physicians don ’ t want to consider the possibility that diet can affect health.i have been taking these and other supplements for a few years now . ( and i ’ m still alive , which is good ; ) ) the supplements that i mentioned above are the ones for which i was unable to find any information about on this site . i ’ m wondering if i should keep taking them or stop – which is safest ? where else can i get good information ? thank you very much ! dr. forrester , i haven ’ t seen you around nutritionfacts.org in a long time . i hope all is well . it ’ s good to have you back.i second toxin ’ s welcome back ! thanks very much.i should have mentioned that i have a brain tumour . ( anaplastic astrocytoma in the cerebellum and brain stem ) i have been watching lots of the fantastic videos here , so i understand that generally a plant based source is much better than a manufactured “ supplement ” .i have been taking these supplements ( listed above , amongst others ) for over four years now , and i am still alive ( which is good , i quite like being alive : ) ) these are the ones that i haven ’ t found a conclusive answer for yet.in my experience , most conventional nutritionists don ’ t have a clue about the benefits of a plant-based diet , and most physicians seem reluctant to believe that diet could be a significant factor in the health of their patients.so my question is : what is the safest path to take : 1. drop these supplements completely 2. keep taking them at the same dosage 3. reduce the dosage to half what i have been takingi guess that 3. is the way to go for any specific supplement that i don ’ t get significant information on ? also , does anyone have any suggestions as to where i might get a more conclusive answer ? thanks very much : ) hi dr forrester ! what about taking also vitamin d and iodin ? do you think it ’ s useless , or even harmful ? um , did anyone think of the possibility that because meat is high in complete protein ( and chicken is particularly high in lean protein , which is why bodybuilders eat it ) the weight gain might be due to lean mass gains ( ie muscle ) . that would be a potentially good result . on a quick look i don ’ t see any control for that in the panacea study , although it seems like an obvious hypothesis.hi lachlan , that is a great point . the study did account for the level of physical activity the participants did , although , it does not mention whether this affected their lean body mass . i will agree that bmi is not a good indicator of lean mass , which the study also mentioned could not be measured due to the nature of the study being observational.it is possible the weight gain was due to an increase in their lean muscle , but i hope you ask yourself if animal protein is really the best way to gain lean muscle . not only does animal protein show a direct relationship with cancer promotion in the body , but eating more plant based protein is preferred among serious health professionals . if you are eating protein sources that also give you the filling effects of fiber , healing effects of antioxidants and much more , you will definintely build lean muscle.i also wanted to let you know that plants not having the “ complete protein ” needed is not true . eating a variety of plants will give you more than enough protein , containing a full spectrum of amino acids . click here to read more about the complete protein myth . i hope you take some time to check out the links in this comment . i can ’ t tell you how much brown rice and chicken breast i have consumed in the past while spending hours in the gym trying to get lean . now , i hardly exercise like i used to and i am much leaner , and in way better health . this information changed my life ! : - ) take care.my sister eat chicken for last 15 yrs but she dsnt get weight gain ? so how you tell chicken give as obesity ? what type of chicken ? boiled ? fried ? cooked in the oven ? chicken meat or skin ? i think that makes a huge difference too . fat people like eating fried chicken with french fries and coca cola ! there you baby ! so in switching to a plant-based diet , how long before we should see results ? i feel better but i do not seem to be losing any weight and i am overweight . is there a list / blog post or a video that outlines more specific findings on increasing weight loss ? here are some of the best weight loss tips i know of for a plant based diet . via jeff novick.if you allow people to eat “ ad libitum ” or all they want till the are comfortably full , from low calorie dense foods , they will lose weight , not be hungry and do not have to count calories.of course , calories still count , but it becomes almost impossible to over consume calories from the foods you choose if you follow these recommendations.these are averagesfresh veggies are around 100 cal / lbfresh fruits around 250-300 cal / lbstarchy veggies / intact whole grains around 450-500 cal / lblegumes around 550-600 cal / lbprocessed grains ( even if their whole grain ) around 1200-1500 cal / lbnuts / seeds around 2800 cal / lboils around 4000 cal / lbwhat they found is if the calorie density of the food is below 400 calories per pound , not matter how much they eat , they all lost weight.between 400-800 calories per pound , with some moderate exercise , they all lost weight.between 800-1200 calories per pound , people gained weight , except for those with very high activity levelsover 1200 calories per pound , everyone gained weight.remember , the physical sensation of “ fullness ” is influenced in a large part by the filling of the stomach and the triggering of the stretch receptors . this would happen regardless of the calorie density of the food , as long as enough food was consumed.however , between 400-800 calories per pound is the range where people either maintained , gained or lost a little . it was the area that i call the “ cut-off ” zone and the results depending on the person and their activity level.these numbers are also inline with other recommendations.the recent wcf / aicr report on cancer recommends that the average calorie density of our diets be around 550-600 calories per pound , to avoid obesity and weight problems.a starch based diet , made up of starchy vegetables and intact whole grains along with some fruit and veggies , will have a calorie density under 500 calories per pound and maybe even 400 calorie per pound . it would be near impossible to overeat.you can also see the problem with many of the “ low fat ” diets that focused on processed whole grains , like whole wheat bread , crackers , dry cereals . at 1200-1500 calories per pound , if they become a large part of the diet , they can raise the overall calorie density and make it much easier to overeat on calories and easy to gain weight and / or not lose weight , even with a higher activity level . hence the principles of the mwl program is to avoid those foods , or really limit them.in regard to how many calories to eat , that is another number , that … .1 ) has no simple answer unless you plan to maintain the exact same physical activity , exercise , stress , temperature , etc etc every day . the concept that everyone needs a certain calorie level that can be determined is wrong.2 ) i do not think people need to know this number nor do i think there are any great ways to calculate it . all the forumlas have great margins of error in them . so does all estimates of how many calories there are in food . any calorie estimate you see on any food package can be up to 20 % off . formulas can be over 40 % off . professionals trying to track their calorie intake can be 30 % off . why attempt to measure something that we have such poor ways of measuring.3 ) calorie density is a much better approach then counting calories as it uses general guidelines and principles to help make healthier choices.we should focus our diets on a variety of healthy foods within the healthy food groups , get enough activity and physical exercise , and not worry about micromanaging our intake.if we need to lose weight , then we can shift our overall calorie density down by focusing on and including more foods lower in calorie density and limiting the higher calorie dense foods . if we need to gain some weight , then we can do the opposite and include more higher calorie dense healthy foods . of course , we can also adjust activity levels to coincide with our food intake and our goals.to summarize for simplicity for those interested in weight maintenanceeat freely : ( foods low in calorie density ) fruits and veggieseat relatively large portions without concern : ( foods moderate in calorie density ) starchy veggies , intact whole grains and legumeslimit these foods ( foods high in calorie density ) breads , bagels , dry cereals , crackers , tortilla ’ s , dried fruitextremely limit these foods : ( foods very high in calorie density ) nuts , seeds , oils , solid fats , junk foodsthe beauty of calorie density is that it frees us from all these numbers and having to count , portion weigh and / or measure anything . so , don ’ t get caught up in the numbers and for those who do not like numbers , just understand the principle . – hunger & satietywhenever hungry , eat until you are comfortably full . don ’ t starve and don ’ t stuff yourself . – sequence your meals.start all meals with a salad , soup and / or fruit – don ’ t drink your caloriesavoid liquid calories . eat / chew your calories , don ’ t drink or liquify them . liquids have little if any satiety so they do not fill you up as much as solid foods of equal calories . – dilution is the solution : dilute out high calorie dense foods / mealsdilute the calorie density of your meals by filling 1 / 2 your plate ( by visual volume ) with intact whole grains , starchy vegetables and / or legumes and the other half with vegetables and / or fruit . – be aware of the impact of vegetables vs fat / oilvegetables are the lowest in calorie density while fat and oil are the highest . therefore , adding vegetables to any dish will always lower the overall calorie density of a meal while adding fat and oil will always raise the overall calorie density of a meal – limit high calorie dense foodslimit ( or avoid ) foods that are higher in calorie density ( dried fruit , high fat plant foods , processed whole grains , etc ) . if you use them , incorporate them into meals that are made up of low calorie dense foods and think of them as a condiment to the meal . for example , add a few slices of avocado added to a large salad , or a few walnuts or raisins added in a bowl of oatmeal and fruit.vwill : toxins reply was * excellent * and a great summary of the concept of calorie density . if you want to expand your understanding a little more , here are some talks that will help with this concept and should help you loose weight without feeling hungry and still getting all of the nutrients you need : [ 1 ] free lecture

question relates to the idea of “ metabolic damage , ” which some folks online explain as an adaptation of the body to reduce the rate of metabolism during periods of starvation , i.e. calorie restriction.what do you think nutritional research suggests about the validity of the theory of metabolic damage ? i guess the suggestion by the people vilifying calorie restriction is that penn , for example , will have a greatly reduced metabolism and that he would gain back the weight quickly because of metabolic damage.another confusing element is that dr. mcdougall says in the starch solution that excess starch calories aren ’ t converted into fat because , essentially , the human body is really bad at de novo lipogenesis . so , would penn have lost as much weight , just maybe more slowly , if he had simply adopted a low fat plant based diet with more calorie dense plant foods such as potatoes and fruit ( he said that he ate some rice , but not fruit and i think not potatoes , too ) ? and would that have been more healthy since it didn ’ t entail such dramatic calorie restriction and the potential for metabolic damage ? i also should say that i understand that i don ’ t know exactly what penn ate on his diet , but i think that it was telling that he didn ’ t count calories , because that likely means that he was filling himself up with low calorie density , high nutritional density foods like greens and colorful veggies with no added oils or animal foods . if he ate 800 calories a day and didn ’ t feel hungry , then i guess this seems like a powerful way for obese people to radically change their bmi ’ s and associated health outcomes , without the feeling of deprivation , not to mention the literal deprivation that comes from eating animal-based foods with low nutritional density , that normally accompanies such radical calorie restriction.i am a huge fan of your work . thanks in advance for any reply.hi ian . thanks for reposting your question . i too am not aware of what penne ate exactly or the validity on the term “ metabolic damage ” . it is not found in a pubmed search , but i found a few websites of course coining the term . that seems like rapid weight loss i hope he was eating enough to feel full and not deprived of nutrients ! at any rate he seemed to see great results and i am happy for him . in this study , a multicenter randomized controlled trial of a plant-based nutrition program to reduce body weight and cardiovascular risk in the corporate setting : the geico study participants followed a plant-based diet with no portion control and still found significant weight loss . i am not certain what is the healthiest approach , but to me if you can achieve weight loss healthfully by not depriving the body of nutrients and feeling full that is a better option than calorie restricted diets . i hope that helps , maybe someone has more to add . a few more videos on calorie restriction and diet from dr. greger if interested . and here . the latter video may be more helpful . let me know if it helps ? thanks again for your comments ! joseph animal products , calories , chicken , exercise , fruit , grains , meat , obesity , plant-based diets , poultry , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians chicken consumption is associated with more weight gain than other meat . the prior video that compared different types of meat and found meat consumption to be associated with weight gain even at the same calorie intake can be found at meat and weight gain in the panacea study.why poultry though ? we don ’ t know , but here ’ s some possible contributing factors : other surprising discoveries in the field include :
PLAIN-2519	how much added sugar is too much ? in 1776 — at the time of the american revolution — americans consumed about 4 lbs of sugar per person each year . by 1850 , this had risen to 20 lbs , and by 1994 , to 120 lbs , and now we ’ re closer to 160 . half of that is fructose , taking up about 10 % of our diet . this is not from eating apples , but rather the fact that we ’ re each guzzling the equivalent of 16-oz soft drink every day ; that ’ s about 50 gallons a year.even researchers paid by the likes of the dr. pepper snapple group and the coca- cola company , acknowledge that sugar is empty calories , containing no essential micronutrients , and therefore if we ’ re trying to reduce calorie intake , reducing sugar consumption is obviously the place to start.concern has been raised , though , that sugar calories may be worst than just empty . a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the fructose added to foods and beverages in the form of table sugar and high fructose corn syrup in large enough amounts can trigger processes that lead to liver toxicity and other chronic diseases.fructose hones in like a laser beam on the liver , and like alcohol , fructose can increase the fat in the liver , increasing the risk for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease , which is one of the most remarkable medical developments over the past 3 decades — the emergence of fatty liver inflammation as a public health problem here and around the globe.these may not be messages that the sugar industry or beverage makers want to hear . in response , the director-general of the industry front group world sugar research organization , replied “ overconsumption of anything is harmful , including of water and air . ” yes , the overconsumption of sugar compared to breathing too much.as one author expressed , i suppose it is natural for the vast and powerful sugar interests to seek to protect themselves , since sugar takes up the single greater percentage of our daily caloric intake.the american heart association is trying to change that . under their new sugar guidelines , most american women should consume no more than 100 calories per day from added sugars , and most american men should eat or drink no more than 150 . that means one can of soda could take us over the top for the day . the new draft guidelines from the world health organization suggests we could benefit from restricting added sugars to under 5 % of calories . that ’ s about 6 spoonfuls of added sugar . i don ’ t know why they don ’ t just recommend zero as optimal , but you can get a sense of how radical their proposal is given that this is how many we consume right now . i eat 30 dates a day , 15 bananas a day . 1 mini watermelon . 5 apples . this is not my whole diet – i eat a low fat diet , with some grains and veggies . is this too much sugar ? too much fructose in these fruits ? if you are active i don ’ t see a problem with it . in an interview usain bolt says he eats 5-10 a day and yohan blake around 16 ! they also eat lots of yams and sweet potatoes . however it could take a toll on your teeth . ( the dates ) love yam jamaicausain bolt and yohan blake are also elite athletes.so you are saying that unless we are fit we shouldn ’ t be consuming this amount of fruit ? so … if you want to be an athlete … . you consume a healthy diet and then once you are labelled an athlete by people like yourself it is ok to eat heaps of fruit ? i don ’ t see the logic . if you wanna be an elite athlete you should consume the fruit before , not after you are an athlete.what you want to do is have your triglycerides checked . the way the liver disposes of excess fructose is to convert it to triglycerides . if your triglycerides are high then you ’ ll need to either cut back on the fruit or up your exercise to burn off the fructose-based glycogen in the liver before it can get converted to triglycerides.actually , fructose metabolism has been traced : the human liver converts 50 % of fructose into glucose and 30 % into lactate . in humans , only 1 % is converted into fat ( triglycerides ) , whereas rat livers convert 50 % to fructose into fat . earlier studies of fructose was done on rats which overstated the dangers to humans.that doesn ’ t mean that we should flood our livers with massive amounts of hfcs , because it may keep the liver preoccupied doing fructose conversion to tend to its other detoxifying duties.mmmmm that might be the variable to monitor in relation to dry then red patches just next to my nose every now and then . does it work like that , liver work overload , and liver then postponing other work in favor of your example fructose ? according to scientific american , yes.http : / / blogs.scientificamerican.com / brainwaves / 2013 / 07 / 15 / is-sugar-really-toxic-sifting-through-the-evidence / however , another source i read gave the potential toxic dose of fructose at 100 g per day . since nobody eats pure fructose , and since it is usually paired with an equal amount of glucose , that would mean an intake of 200 g of table sugar or hfcs . that ’ s between 6-7 oz of sugar . that ’ s the equivalent of 5 cans of coke.otoh , kempner ’ s rice diet included huge amounts of sugar . some patients consumed up to 400g of sugar per day.can you provide the sources for this info ? thanks.the sources are linked to the article . just search the page for the word fructose . it appears only twice.is sugar really toxic ? sifting through the evidencehttp : / / blogs.scientificamerican.com / brainwaves / 2013 / 07 / 15 / is-sugar-really-toxic-sifting-through-the-evidence / i ’ ve got another video coming up called how many fruit is too many ? stay tuned ! really looking forward it . fruit indulgence * * * * excess consumption has a divided jury , and maybe you ’ llhelp clear the division . i think a lot of heavy fruit eaters aren ’ t sure if they are causing themselves long-term harm – * * * by heavy i mean the amount of fruits listed in the top post “ 30 dates a day , 15 bananas a day . 1 mini watermelon . 5 apples ” a day.every time i binge on fruit … like a bag of oranges … .i end up having what i assume is yeast overgrowth . i ’ m doubting that it is healthy.likely you are indulging in a post-prandial sugar high that you are trying to maintain ? kids like sugar … it ’ s a high . real men go out and kill something . lol.if i indulge too much … i can have a hypoglycemic reaction . i notice older people don ’ t like sugar so much … probably can ’ t process it as well ? that ’ s nice , but i ’ m breathlessly awaiting your “ how much air is too much ? ” video . ; - ) roflol ! ! hyperventilation can be a serious health risk ! : pi don ’ t think it ’ s the quantity per say , but rather the degree to which it is “ hot ” that is the real thing to watch out for.lol , good point . : - ) looking forward to see your fruits video . however : you need to work hard to convince me that there is a large difference between dates / bananas and sugar . in the end , both contain mainly sugar ( fructose , sucrose & glucose ) . fruits contain also dietary fiber , but that does not convince me that that it ’ s good enough . if you eat 3 dates it ’ s like eating 8-9 tea spoons of sugar . if sugar is bad then at least some of the fruits are bad.agreed. biochemically there is no difference . the reason fructose “ hits ” the liver is because liver cells are the only cells in the body that can convert fructose to useable glucose and other sugars.alarmist lustig md has been influenced by patients whose hypothalamuses have been damaged by brain tumors . he ’ s wrongly extrapolating to the general public . his rhetoric is peppered with inaccurate statements . mark hyman ’ s statement that sugar is 8x more toxic than heroin is just plain irresponsible.btw there is a concerted effort by the animal food industry to shift the blame for heart disease and diabetes on the saturated fats and cholesterol in their products to sugar and carbs in general , which includes the funding of headline-grabbing junk science studies one of which was just published in plos one . the attached image comes from the beef checkoff program … mr. lustig must have built up a formidable tolerance to heroin , 24 hr a day drip for the past decade ? ^ ^ on a serious note , i do hope the limit on fruit will be a high one . i suspect eating zante currants as candy up to and every now and then over a 100 gr a day might be pushing the limit.eating fruits is okyes , too much sugar natural or not . look at jj virgin ’ s new book , sugar impact dieti ’ m illiterate — what ’ s the gist of the book ? sugar bad — high fat good ? exercise more ? lose x pounds in a week ? j j virgin is marketing , pure and simple.i wouldn ’ t be concern about varied whole food sources of sugar . the video was focused on added sugars to foods which is much different than just the compound we call sugar.according to lustig , the fiber in the fruit is the antidote to the toxicity of fructose.and do you believe that ? there is no reason not to beleive it . increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is one of the least controversial thing somebody can do for health promotion . fruits and refined sugar are not the same thing .. lustig ’ s premise is faulty . the difference between fruit and the sugar in processed foods not fiber but dosage.i think you ’ re missing the lustig ’ s points in that single statement . 1 . you ’ d have to eat a lot of fruit to get the same impact as in a glass of cola or fruit juice . 2 . the fiber releases the sugar slowly so it hits the liver slowly . the higher doses in cola & fruit juice hit the liver all at once . 3 . he also distinguishes between hfcs and other sugars , including old fashion sweeteners like karo syrup . i ’ m not sure how much of what he says is correct , but i think he has some good points.i understand lustig ’ s points better than you think i do . ( google “ robert lustig criticism ” . search for lustig ’ s name at http : / / carbsanity.blogspot.com ) the man is a buddy of atkins / low carb high fat proponent gary taubes , and just like taubes , he oversimplifies and misrepresents facts . to lustig , it is sugar alone that is responsible for obesity , diabetes , and heart disease . ( taubes blames pretty much all carbs . ) the problem with sugar in any form , including hfcs , is not that it is toxic in and of itself but that it is used to make non-satiating but calorically dense processed foods more palatable , causing passive overconsumption of calories , anywhere from 300-700 calories / day . those calories include flour and added oils ( carbs + fat + protein ) . add that to sedentary lifestyles , and you have a perfect storm of caloric excess . that ’ s what ’ s toxic.satiety counts . refined carbs are not very filling.fiber and water in fruit can curb the amount of fructose consumed and slow down its release somewhat . but nullify toxicity ? nope . lustig is soooo inaccurate in his biochemistry . even practicing low carb high fat biochemists have called him out on his epic wrongness . one can only wonder at the sensationalist publicity he ’ s gotten . must be because he ’ s such a buddy with gary taubes.the difference is dosage . sugars by any name , be it glucose , fructose , maltose , lactose , etc . , are all biochemically identical regardless of the source.the difference is source.yes , chemically a sucrose molecule is the same regardless . however , just looking at sugar as a problem means that one has to ignore the rest of the food and thus , all the other benefits or bad things.example – is eating two apples as bad for you as drinking a soda even though they have about the same sugar content ? clearly not . focusing on a single nutrient will lead to malnutrition . this is why many supplements don ’ t work well or at all . they are missing other key compounds that they normally arrive in the body with when they are in whole food sources rather than a single compound isolated from thousands in a food.i didn ’ t say a can of soda is nutritionally superior or comparable to a couple of apples . you miss my point.people are freaking out about sugar because of saturated fat apologists / sugar alarmists like lustig and sugar-is-8x-more-toxic-than-heroin hyman.my own cardiologist eats unripe fruit for fear of the sugar content . this is just crazy ! plus … this anti-sugar campaign is all part of the animal food industry ’ s objective to frame carbohydrates as the primary cause of heart disease , obesity , and diabetes while exonerating their own products with pay-to-publish junk science studies that grab the headlines.i apologize for misunderstanding.i think i read your post with my inner monologue whispering into my ear that you were another sugar fighter regardless of source.i might need to go eat a few more carbs and then re-read the post again : - ) to add up a bit to the conversation – i watched a pretty nice experiment with two identical twin brothers , both doctors . they decided to live , for a month , one on a high-fat diet , and the other on high-sigar diet , and see in the end who ends up sicker than the other . the result was interesting , the high-fat diet guy ( who ate no sugar in any form ) actually ended up prediabetic . the guy with high-sugar content ( no fat ) had a pretty stable insulin release levels . of course , before the experiment both had measures of blood sugar , bla bla .. they were both with identical measures . both had lost weight after the experiment , the guy on fat had lost more weight from muscle tissue than from fat stores . the guy on sugar , lost 1,5 kg of fat . of course , these two diets are both unhealthy either way , but it clearly shows who the culprit is . oh , the guy on fat had problems with memory and concentration and when they had to go cycling for 1 hr , the guy on fat gave up very quickly , he was breathing terribly … the final experiment was with mice though . they gave one group of mice only sugar . the mice ate just a normal amount of calories and stopped eating until they felt hungry . they remained lean and behaved normally . another group of mice were given fat . they also restricted their consumption and didn ’ t overeat . a third group though was given both fat and sugar in one meal ( cheese cake ) . they gorged until they got lazy and in the end fat . they ate constantly , without being hungry . i am not a sugar advocate but you ’ re attacking sugar too much . it ’ s everywhere in nature and animals eat it , and i don ’ t see why we shouldn ’ t eat it , or restrict it . my great-grandmother and my mother ate loads of fruits during the summers . my mother has only a few cavities . my great-grandmother died with her own teeth in her mouth , not having lost even a tooth . for me , the bottom line is , if it is a fruit , with all the nutrients and fiber etc , i ’ d not think about the sugar . i ’ d consider it when it is out of its natural form . of course , i am very curious what the next video on too much fruit will show : ) ( oh , and 15 bananas … i can ’ t imagine that but you definitely don ’ t need 30 dates a day ! ! ! there ’ s plenty of other fruits , you need to have a variety in your meal ) .wow ! that ’ s fascinating about the twins . got a link for documentation and tweeting ? ? agreed about the fat + sugar being a problem , because it ’ s not the sugar itself , or even the fat itself , that causes overconsumption . it ’ s the flavor , the texture , and other physical properties of the food . if it were just sugar alone , we ’ d all prefer lemons over oranges and granny smith apple ’ s over other varieties because they are highest in sugar in their fruit categories.i watched the documentary on a swedish tv channel , and it had a swedish title , which i don ’ t remember , but here is an article about the two guys – http : / / www.dailymail.co.uk / health / article-2546975 / one-twin-gave-sugar-gave-fat-their-experiment-change-your-life.html anyway , really a fantastic experiment . i loved it ! it explained so much about why we overeat and why our appetites are just uncontrollable … and who is in fact the bad guy : ) oh , and it also explains why there is no such food , high in fat and high in carbs in nature . these two are almost always separated , where either fat or sugar is higher in content , and the other reasonably low . i prefer to make my dietary choices based on what the plant world gives us . i am avoid processed fats ( even olive oil , since it ’ s not in its natural form , i just prefer to eat more olives or avocados or nuts for the fatty content ) and i am conscious about mixing too much fat and too much carbs in one meal . i believe these are simple guidelines for people struggling with illnesses and obesity.i found the documentary ! ! ! it ’ s bbc horizon : sugar vs fathttp : / / www.dailymotion.com / video / x1amh2t _ bbc-horizon-sugar-v-fat-h264-1280 × 720-aac-rmac _ lifestylethanks so much for the heads up , eva . it ’ s well worth watching ! ! ! i love the way it blows taubes / lustig ’ s dogma out of the water , what ↑ evelyn “ carbsane ” kocur calls twichoo or taubes ’ wrong insulin-carbohydrate hypothesis of obesity . : ) i hope you like it , for me at least it was a brilliant experiment , and most of all the conclusion where it all comes down to , the mix of the two that makes it so addictive … the take-away from this documentary is good ( besides the negative effects of a lchf diet ) : the synergistic effect of sugar + fat is hard to resist.however , it still is incomplete . there is no fat in soft drinks . but there is flavor from other components … and that fizzy tingling sensation . there ’ s more going on with man-made foods than sugar and fat.i think michael moss has enumerated the complexities of human junk food quite well . ( 1 ) salt ( 2 ) sugar ( 3 ) fat ( 4 ) convenience , plus some sub-features like texture , crunch / crispness ( including sound ) , and that melt-in-your-mouth quality . the studies on rats and human junk food also pointed to variety as a factor , as well.thank you eva for bringing this up and macsmiley for the link ! there were some aspects of that movie that drove me nuts , but over all , i thought it was very interesting – especially the parts related to diabetes . thanks ! there will never be a complete video or movie for about 1hr in length . : ) i understand many people may be disappointed . but in the end , one can always get some conclusions for oneself , and find something meaningful and important from the whole movie . i enjoyed the whole of it , but the conclusive experiment on the mice was what made most sense to me . : ) eva : i completely agree that there is only so much one can cover in an hour . the problem i had with the movie was the way they actively promoted some important misinformation . so , instead of dispelling myths like they claimed , they dispelled some and contributed to others.for example , they equated simple sugars ( like jello ) to “ carbs ” to whole grains and fruits and veggies . they did this multiple times in several ways – including leading people to believe that whole plant foods do not make one feel full – at least as full as protein . ( when in fact the doctor was eating simple sugars , syrup and powdered sugar , and refined foods without the fiber . ) another example is that they outright said that eggs are a “ good fat ” and do not have saturated fat . that ’ s just so wrong it took my breath away because i wasn ’ t expecting it on a show like this . they did some good things to clear up some myths , but that one hour could have been a so much better by simply being accurate within it ’ s own scope.a knowledgeable person can learn a lot from that one hour . but a newbie is just going to end up with a lot more confusion in the end . that ’ s why it “ drove me nuts ” . but as i said , i really did appreciate you pointing it out for me . i found certain parts of it fascinating.i can ’ t agree more with you , thea . it ’ s just that personally i already know some things for myself ( like ‘ eggs are not healthy , meat is not healthy ’ , etc ) and i just dismiss sentences like ‘ eggs are healthy ’ etc . i watch something or read something only as long as i read something new , or see a new experiment . usually what fascinates me is when someone tries something on themselves . i won ’ t believe science completely until i see results after experiments on real subjects . it may sound cruel ( and it is for mice at least ) , but when it comes to humans , i can ’ t wait to see it . after all , the movie was produces by horizon , they are pretty mainstream , i am well aware of that.again , the last bit was most interesting for me , personally , because i realised why actually we are so blindly drawn towards fatty sugary food , why we can ’ t control ourselves a bit more . that question haunted me for years , and the movie ’ s end hit me ! : ) again , i just dismiss the outrageous parts and move on . it may be very very misleading for a newbie and i will definitely not recommend it to such a person.i take out what ’ s new for me , i always search for what is untested , or unknown . the horizon series has other such videos with test subjects ( the controvertial and widely hated michael mosley ) , which also show interesting discoveries.mosley is widely hated ? yes , at least that ’ s what i read all over the internet , forums , discussion groups , etc … i find his movies interesting , but it seems he ’ s really controversial for many people.he is fascinating though ! i loved it when he swallowed that pill / camera and we got to see the inner workings of the human digestive system . : - ) i haven ’ t seen his “ meat ” documentary yet . have you ? yup , i saw it out of curiosity , but it kind of didn ’ t show any new unexplored perspectives … . it always comes down to eat less meat or none . he doesn ’ t like the idea of no meat so he seeks a healthy doze of meat daily . i think you won ’ t miss anything if you don ’ t see it . i didn ’ t learn anything i don ’ t already know.good points , thea.experiments with mice / rats and human junk food started back in the 1970 ’ s . ( search pubmed for “ cafeteria diet ” ) hard to believe it ’ s taken this long to get that information out to the general public ! when rat chow is spiked with high amounts of sugar , in any form , the animals may binge on the chow , but then they eat less later on . so their caloric energy balance does not change . even when fat and sugar is added to the chow , they may binge , but they do not overeat.but give them human junk food and ohh là là ! ! ! : ) ) yeah , there ’ s clearly more than just fat and sugar . and if we add the chemicals , the flavours … . well … things get messy . it ’ s true that if i eat ( i ’ ve tried that these days ) 100 grams of pistachios mixed with 1-2 tea spoons of honey , i feel pretty full when i ’ m done . well , i guess i can keep eating since it ’ s not exactly a wholesome meal , but i definitely don ’ t have an uncontrollable appetite after that . i guess you have a point … by the way , actually wheat has some chemical that has an addictive effect on the brain . so , if they gave mice cheesecake i think that explains why they never stopped eating it … thank you for pointing out the junk food part : ) i hope those are organic apples you ’ re eating . according to the environmental working group , apples are the number one or two food most polluted with pesticide residue , depending on the year of their annual report.correct , but i ’ ll love to see a list of pollutants in animal product to compare . because i hear lot of people saying that to justify the fact that they don ’ t eat enough fruit and vegetable . the solution is organic apple , not beef . even if it ’ s grass feed.the vast majority of studies showing the benefits of fruit and vegetables in the diets are done with conventional pesticide-laden produce . organic produce has organic pesticides . buy organic for other reasons.i eat mostly fruit too , but 30 bananas in one day is a lot . and there are so many better fruits out there that have more water and more goodness in them.the un ’ s food & ag organization website , at http : / / www.fao.org / docrep / 007 / y5102e / y5102e04.htm states : “ the importance of bananas as a food crop in tropical areas cannot be underestimated . in uganda , for example , annual consumption per capita was some 243 kg in 1996 , and between 100 and 200 kg in rwanda , gabon and cameroon . in these 4 countries , bananas account for between 12 percent and 27 percent of daily calorie intake of their populations . ” hi guest , wow , that sounds like a lot of fruit , but it ’ s great that you ’ re enjoying a variety of fresh whole plant foods . whether or not this is too much sugar or too much fructose for you depends on a number of factors . dr. greger is coming out with a video discussing how much fruit is too much , but in the meantime , here is one video that may shed some light on the topic : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit / .here are just a couple of my thoughts : 1 ) are you at your ideal weight or would you prefer to lose weight ? what is your activity level ? that might be too many calories and too much sugar for someone who is sedentary , but may be fine for someone who is extremely actively like a marathon runner.2 ) do you know your trigliceride or cholesterol numbers ? while dates don ’ t seem to raise triglicerides in studies despite their high sugar content , excess sugar is converted to triglicerides ( fat in the blood ) .there are many studies , including this one : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15370099 and http : / / www.bmj.com / content / 347 / bmj.f5001 showing that the consumption of whole fruit reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes , while fruit juice does not . however , these studies do not study people who consume the volume of fruit you have described.i really can ’ t judge without knowing your overall health or activity level , but for most people who only get a moderate amount of exercise , i would advise trying less fruit , more vegetebles and the addition of some beans , legumes and nuts and seeds and see how you feel . regardless , it sounds like you are eating a very delicious and nutrient-rich diet.i hope that helps , emily : ) p.s. please be sure you are taking b12 too ! http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 12 / 18 / the-vitamin-everyone-on-a-plant-based-diet-needs / i recently started using date syrup as a sweetener in my cocoa drink made with nut milk . is that okay ? how does erythritol fit into this picture ? do we get a by on this sweetener ? so happy to see this topic , and i ’ m glad to see that it will be revisited . now that researchers have finally demonstrated a causative link between sugar consumption and diabetes risk i ’ d love to know just how much one ’ s risk for diabetes increases given x teaspoons of daily sugar intake ( or x % of daily caloric intake , whatever the standard measurement is ) .jane , the video doesn ’ t mention diabetes . it says that excess refined sugar leads to liver toxicity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.it other words , refined sugar is bad for your liver , but it doesn ’ t make you fat . fat makes you fat.fat makes you fat.actually , calories in excess of the body ’ s metabolic needs makes you fat , whether those calories come from carbs , proteins , or fat.and as i recall , studies presented on nf show that environmental toxins , pesticides , bad diets and other triggers can change the body ’ s rate of metabolism , thereby affecting how many calories the body holds onto from the same amount of calories under optimal conditions.even if something other than food is affecting our metabolisms , that does not negate the energy balance equation . calories in ( digested and absorbed ) must equal calories expended or weight gain will result.right , what we think we need in terms of calories can change because of environmental factors , however , that does not change the validity of the cico equation . it just changes the values of the variables . get it ? sugar causes diabetes ? ? not so fast.have you seen this bbc documentary pointed out by eva … ? horizon : sugar vs fat . it ’ s the twin eating no sugar for a whole month , who loses more weight , who ends up pre-diabetic . diabetes is more complex than just sugar , as it involves fat and protein metabolism as well as carbs . it ’ s diabetes which causes problems with carbs , not carbs that cause diabetes.article : http : / / www.dailymail.co.uk / health / article-2546975 / one-twin-gave-sugar-gave-fat-their-experiment-change-your-life.htmlthe documentary : http : / / www.dailymotion.com / video / x1amh2t _ bbc-horizon-sugar-v-fat-h264-1280 × 720-aac-rmac _ lifestylewhile i ’ m not justifying the extreme processed carb side of the experiment ( or the similar amounts of heavily refined carbs in the sad ) , this is no surprise to those eating all or mostly whole plants.http : / / plantpositive.com / 35-how-to-become-insulin-resis / http : / / plantpositive.com / 36-how-to-become-insulin-resis / in the book about blue zones , there ’ s even a story of a centenarian cooking up his own refined sugar from sugarcane grown in his own garden ! context is everything.hi jane . i think that a good point to bring up here is one that dr. greger addresses in another video . all fructose is not considered to be equal- industrial fructose vs. fruit fructose are different birds . there have been different theories on this but it seems that the fiber within the fruit as well as the phytonutrients ( maybe more important than the fiber ) seems to blunt the diabetic response , if you will . check out the video here , and remember to eat blueberries with your pancakes as dr greger says ! ( wink ) if fructose is bad what about fruit ? i ’ m really starting to look at nutritionfacts.org as the discovery channel for nutrition ! sweeeet information ! i ’ ll see your granny smith and raise you a honey crisp ! ! ! i love the image ! ! ! thanks for the visual joke ! ooops , i just at 5 bananas today.i am so glad to hear that you will be addressing the effects of sugar in fruit . i have been really wanting some solid information on this . thanks.i agree with this when it comes to refined processed sugars , but i can ’ t see this applying to whole fruits . there are people like michael arnstein who eat mostly fruit and are in great health . in fact arnstein is breaking long distance running records living on a diet of mostly fruit and his blood work is perfect . how do you explain him and other thriving fruitarians ? like those eating 30 bananas a day and doing great also.they are burning their calories everyday doing an amount of exercise that 99 percent of humans could never imagine . it is such a specialized group of athletes such as arnstein . there is concern that the person who exercises normally , everyday , maybe for an hour , might be causing harm by eating over 2500 calories per day from fruit , especially high sugar fruits , fructose fruits , – dates , bananas , apples , watermelons … … – even 2 or 3 hours of exercise , is that enough to burn off this amount of sugar ? talk to or just look at any fruitarian and you ’ ll see that ’ s not true . inactive high-calorie fruit eaters who aren ’ t athletes stay lean and healthy long-term.it ’ s called lean body mass wasting . i have a hard time believing that inactive fruitarians get enough protein and other nutrients . generally , with 1g or less of protein in each serving of fruit , only endurance athletes can pull off an enormously high fruit diet because of the massive amounts of calories they expend . even harley johnstone has mentioned having difficulty holding on to his lbm.dr. lustig notes that the adverse effects of fructose occur in sedentary ( “ glycogen replete ” ) individuals . his arguments centered around the de novo lipogenesis pathway don ’ t apply to our ancestors climbing trees for widely separated fruit , or modern endurance athletes . in an alternative hypothesis that high fructose loadings lead to small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , gut barrier permeability , and liver and systemic exposure to endotoxins , the dose makes the poison , as absorbed fructose isn ’ t available for pathobiont fermentation . individual fruit are well below our limited absorption capacity for fructose of around 25 g , which is not the case for even 12 oz portions of many sugar sweetened beverages . moreover , poorly absorbed components of whole fruit , such as polyphenols ( 1 , 2 ) and fermentable dietary fiber ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) may serve a protective role in gut dysbiosis and permeability.this must all be true . i won ’ t lie in saying that i completely understand all the science cited . but he ’ s right . if you simply watch our closest living relatives , the monkeys and chimps , they will often lay around all day if they ’ re not moving anywhere and food is abundant . meanwhile they are still eating their normal amount of mostly fruit and greens and maybe some nuts and bugs.if you have some time : here ’ s a nice analysis of lustig ’ s claims http : / / plantpositive.com / 25-cholesterol-confusion-8-a-l you can watch the video ( 30 minutes ) or just read the transcript. the tl ; dw / dr is simple : lustig is a blithering moron , and he often has no clue what he is talking about.i ’ ve great respect for the person behind the plant positive videos , and no , i ’ m not especially fond of some of the nutrition company dr.lustig has been associated with , but i ’ ve worked through many of the sources cited by lustig and think they ’ ve got very legitimate points . lustig himself would probably admit the main thing that he ’ s brought to the discussion on fructose / sucrose ( which has been going on at least 3 decades in the literature ) is the analogy with alcohol metabolism . regardless of lustig ’ s media persona , high-fructose feeding has very similar outcomes to high-saturated fat feeding in experimental insulin resistance / nafld / diabetes.why fructose is not like alcoholhttp : / / carbsanity.blogspot.com / 2013 / 06 / why-fructose-is-not-like-alcohol.html ? m = 1while true in a sense , gail doesn ’ t address the key metabolic issue with fructose , which is that it bypasses the main rate-limiting step in glycolysis , catalysed by phosphofructokinase . its the reaction inhibited ( denoted by the ‘ ⊣ ’ ) by atp and citrate in her first image . whereas glucose metabolism is tightly regulated by its own products , fructose continuously and uncontrollably is metabolised to pyruvate and lactate , precursors to acetyl-coa , de novo lipogenesis , triglycerides and vldl . ethanol metabolism also bypasses the negative feedback of phosphofructokinase enroute to acetyl-coa.dr. lustig has had a minor role in the fructose debate in the literature , and none before sugar : the bitter truth was initially presented in 2009 . ignore him entirely , and indeed everything written after his presentation , and a pretty damning case can still be made : isocaloric exchange of dietary starch and sucrose in humans . i. effects on levels of fasting blood lipids ( 1979 ) isocaloric exchange of dietary starch and sucrose in humans . ii . effect on fasting blood insulin , glucose , and glucagon and on

better than i. have you posted it there ? darryl , may i suggest the following post : http : / / evolvinghealthscience.blogspot.com / 2012 / 05 / fate-of-fructose-interview-with-dr-john.htmlthanks.an issue one can take with dr. sievenpiper is that , at least when supplied in refined form to animals or humans , fructose isn ’ t an isocaloric substitution for other caloric sources in the real world . 1 , 2 . so hypercaloric fructose intake may be the more realistic experimental condition.actually , hypercaloric fructose intake is the unrealistic experimental condition . doesn ’ t exist in nature , and i don ’ t think i missed the fructose-only sweetened beverage bonanza.yes , thanks for bringing up the gut barrier permeability as a possible result of excess fructose consumption . for now i have to consider as a possibility that yes , 15-20 medjool dates a day , along with lots of other high fructose fruits could , long-term , lead to gut permeability and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.darryl , the link for the study you referenced … .. i can ’ t seem to make sense of whether or not they are including whole fruit fructose in the 25 g ( limited absorption capacity figure ) . one of the beloved medjool dates contains 7grams of fructose , and yeah … .in whole fruit fiber package , but this 7g figure makes me wonder , at what point does the human intestine have limited capacity for even whole fruit fructose , as 10 medjool dates would be a whopping 70 grams of fructose in one sitting . fiber or no fiber , i ’ d think that at some point we humans could exceed a threshold , no ? throw in a bag of apples and watermelon and what ever else and by the end of the day you ’ ve blown through well over 175 grams of fructose.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1994910 / the study used a single rapidly drunk liquid solution ( with varying amounts of pure fructose 15-50 g ) . while these amounts and form are comparable to sugar / hfcs sweetened beverages , fruit may be a different matter , both from the slower digestion of bits , the stimulus by solid food of gastric acid and bile production ( which are how bacteria are normally excluded from the small intestine ) , and the phenol and fiber content of the fruit.personally , while recognizing that there are some very healthy people on 80 / 10 / 10 mostly fruit diets , i avoid added sugar and take my fruit in the form of 3 servings of black & blue berries spread through the day , as berries have the highest ratio of flavonoids to fructose . this amounts to 4 % of my daily energy , less than half of the average american intake from fructose.the exercises from sun-up to sun-down , 7 days a week , 365 days per year . not something most indulging fruit eaters are doing , i ’ d have to think.my metabolic specialist says that fruit is for kids , not adults . to use in moderation . fruit juice is filled with sugar.yes , fruit juice is full of sugar , and fruit should be consumed in it ’ s whole form.does your “ metabolic specialist ” have any hard evidence for this assertion , or is just silly fad bs he / she read somewhere ? from the majority of “ metabolic specialists ” i ’ ve interacted with , many buy into all kinds of bunk and should not be used as a reference for much of anything.does this only apply to added fructose ? i would think fructose in a fruit isn ’ t nearly as harmful since it comes with so many other nutrients.i don ’ t eat as much fruit as a fruitarian , but i do eat usually about 3 bananas a day , as well as some other fruit , such as a kiwi or orange . even so , my glucose level recently went down from the highest acceptable level of 99 down to 90 . my ldl cholesterol is now 81- it is slowly going down . my triglycerides are 43 and my hdl is 77 . i think fruit is not only not harmful , but positively beneficial , but fruit juice can be harmful ( because of the lack of fiber ) . this study http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22882905 found a inverse relationship between whole fruits and the development of type 2 diabetes and a positive relationship between fruit juice and type 2 diabetes . from what i remember , lustig stated that fruit wasn ’ t harmful , because it had fiber in it . i would certainly think processed sweets , such as cakes , donuts , cookies and pies would contribute to both type 2 diabetes and heart disease . i noticed last night reading labels , that some brownies for sale at the store had some trans fats in them . just 1 or 2 tablespoons of ready to spread frosting has 1.5-2 grams of trans fat . i not only have cut out the meat , but i have really made an effort to drastically reduce my consumption of processed trans fats , as well as sweets . everyone agrees that trans fats are especially harmful.the concern is not having “ normal fruit consumption . ” the concern is that some vegans are consuming over 2000 calories a day of fruit , some over 3000 calories a day , and what are the long-term consequences of this ? 3 bananas , no big deal . 15 bananas … . ? @ 0 dates ? sugar addiction ? maybe it is ok for someone exercises for 8 hours a day.here is an article http : / / well.blogs.nytimes.com / 2013 / 07 / 31 / making-the-case-for-eating-fruit / which quotes david ludwig as stating that the amount of fruit does not matter , “ dr. david ludwig , the director of the new balance foundation obesity prevention center at boston children ’ s hospital , said that sugar consumed in fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects , no matter how much you eat . in a recent perspective piece in the journal of the american medical association , he cited observational studies that showed that increased fruit consumption is tied to lower body weight and a lower risk of obesity-associated diseases . ” it even quotes robert lustig as saying , “ another nutrition expert , dr. robert lustig , a professor of pediatrics at the university of california , san francisco , who has called sugar “ toxic ” at high doses and fructose the most “ actionable ” problem in our diet , is still a fan of fruit . “ as far as i ’ m concerned , fiber is the reason to eat fruit , ” since it promotes satiety and the slow release of sugar . he adds a third benefit from fiber : it changes our “ intestinal flora , ” or microbiome , by helping different species of healthy bacteria thrive . ” this article also states something which has been stated on nutritionfacts.org , which is , “ fiber provides “ its greatest benefit when the cell walls that contain it remain intact , ” he said . sugars are effectively sequestered in the fruit ’ s cells , he explained , and it takes time for the digestive tract to break down those cells . the sugars therefore enter the bloodstream slowly , giving the liver more time to metabolize them . four apples may contain the same amount of sugar as 24 ounces of soda , but the slow rate of absorption minimizes any surge in blood sugar . ” in the 1970 ’ s i developed a condition called reactive hypoglycemia . unlike base line low blood sugar , the reactive type involves the improper reaction to the consumption of sugar . the reason for this i learned was in part due to a fatty liver . the liver is an essential part of maintaining normal blood sugar levels . my physician at the time practised holistic medicine which included putting patients on a plant based diet . one of the side affects of this was to return my liver to normal function.eventually i regained my health and have never returned to my old eating pattern . a part of my healing process involved learning about nutrition and how various food affects that body . from personal experience and lots of research i can say without exception that refined sugar , and high hfcs ( high fructose corn syrup ) are 2 things which are highly dangerous and destructive in the human diet.reading through the comments i noted some some confusion about fructose found in nature and those found in processed foods . it ’ s important to note that get get sugar from fruit requires that the food be digested first . this involves breaking down and separating the sugars from the fibre , as well as all the nutrients and micro-nutrients in the food . refined sugar is absorbed quickly with little or no actual digestion involved causing the blood sugar to spike quickly , and challenging the body to quickly react to normalize the levels of blood sugar.such a spike in blood sugar is less likely when eating fruit and vegetables because of the work involved to extract the sugars during digestion . in addition , it is my feeling that the body recognizes and distinguishes between sugar derived directly from food , and that which has been processed in advance.hfcs on the other hand does not exist in nature and so creates a whole series of other issues , one of which is development of a fatty liver . this is not simple conjecture of political spin , it is a product of extensive research . according to one of the leading researcher hfcs damages the liver in much the same way as does alcohol . this has to do with a very complicated process which is far to detailed to describe here.if you want more detailed information you should search for videos or articles on the subject . several excellent videos were available for free on youtube . the better ones contain very detailed and technically specific information about biochemistry from a world expert . however there are others which are more intended for the lay public.i would also pay close attention to dr gregors advice re hfcs.not defending hfcs : it ’ s problematic because of its ubiquity and amounts used . yes , the free glucose / fructose in hfcs is not found in nature , but replacing it with sucrose ( mexican / kosher coke ) is no improvement because of the swiftness of with which the body uncouples the disaccharide . practically instantaneous.lustig ’ s comparison of fructose to alcohol is one of his alarmist inaccuracies . another inaccuracy is fructose ’ s contribution to blood sugar spikes . fructose is the lowest substance on the glycemic index.in addition to plant positive ’ s videos about lustig , you can find more of his science # fail at carbsanity ’ s blog.http : / / carbsanity.blogspot.com / just search the blog for his last name.i have had 0 grams of added sugar in the last 8 months . this is one of the best decisions i have ever made ! together with the other changes my body has been transformed from sickness to success ! there are so many opinions and conflicting research that i find the more i read and learn the more eating what is good and healthy these days becomes one of the hardest things to do . everything seemingly needs an ‘ nth ’ degree of control , and to the health conscious food and it ’ s many complexities is fast becoming an obsession . sometimes there is just so much you can do with the knowledge you have and the time available . personally we love fruit and vegetables alike and we do not eat meat . i would like the preparation of food and the consumption of it to be less fraught and stressful than it is becoming and more of a delight and a pleasure to share with friends and loved ones.its amazing how if one just cuts out all processed food and allows natural , whole foods to provide natural sugars we would not have such epidemics . thanks for your work dr. g. such an inspiration.with regards to the sugar content of dates , dr. greger posted a video ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-dates-good-for-you / ) addressing the high sugar content ( 80 % sugar by weight ) and what we would presume to be an adverse effect on blood sugar levels post-consumption . the conclusion given in the video is very hard to accept ( believe ? ) and seems to contradict what would intuitively make sense … that given the exceedingly high sugar content of dates , there would most definitely be a a negative impact on blood sugar level after “ stuffing oneself with the things ” . having a hard time reconciling this . thoughts ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-dates-good-for-you / sorry about that , but i can ’ t seem to paste in the link to the video . again … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-dates-good-for-you / just do a search on “ dates ” and you ’ ll get the video titled , “ are dates good for you ? ” did two interesting ( to me at least ) calculations to get a clearer view . first , dr. greger cites 1776 as 4 pounds sugar per year . this sounded low enough that i guessed he meant that little * added * sugar per year , not total sugar , but to check up on this , calculated this way , to compare to bananas : 4 pounds in grams ( b / c 1776 4 pounds sugar per year ) = 1814 1814 / 365 = 4.9698630137 grams per day ( just type any arithemetic or units convertion into google search and it spits out the answer ) which rounds very very well to 5 grams of sugar per day.also given that : medium banana : 14.4 grams sugar ( includes skin but i imagine there is little sugar in the skin ) ( per http : / / www.calorieking.com / foods / calories-in-fresh-fruits-bananas-raw _ f-zmlkptczmzi5.html ) so that means that if the figure cited in the paper dr. greger quotes * includes * in-the-fruit sugar , then they ate the equivalent of only one-third of a banan per day and no other sugar at all in 1776 ( no other fruit with sugar , like apples etc ) ? that sounds too low they must be talking about added sugar , right ? eating the proverbial “ apple a day ” would include 10.6 grams per day , more than twice the “ 5 grams per day ” cited for 1776.so i ’ m pretty sure this means “ grams of added sugar ” … either that or they had less than a half apple a day ( and no bananas or any other fruit ) on average , which is conceivable , but certainly not what we condier healthy today ( eating * more * than a half apple per day in terms of fruit consumption equivalent is recommended .. and i say this as a person who doesn ’ t like fruit that much and prefers veggies .. ) either way for all future videos being clear on “ grams of sugar from all sources ” versus “ grams of added sugar , not counting those in fruit ” would be helpful to clarify.second calculation was the quote by zuppkko that : “ the importance of bananas as a food crop in tropical areas cannot be underestimated . in uganda , for example , annual consumption per capita was some 243 kg in 1996 , and between 100 and 200 kg in rwanda , gabon and cameroon . in these 4 countries , bananas account for between 12 percent and 27 percent of daily calorie intake of their populations . ” was scratching my head to make more sense of this in terms of fruit consumption again . “ sfgate.com ” says “ avg ” banana is 4ounces , the calorieking says 4.2 ounces for “ medium “ banaa is including the peel … which might weigh more than 0.2 / 4 = 5 % of the weight .. but close enough so say “ 4oz ” per medium banana.say 150kg per year ( middle of the 100 to 200 kg range for the latter two countries ) and converg kg to grams and from annual to daily to get ( 150 * 1000 ) / 365 which is 411 grams per day.google “ 411 grams in ounces ” and google ’ s built in calculator spits out : 14.5 ounces ( per day ) 14.5 ounces / 4ounces per med banana = 3.625 bananas per day .. that is finally a figure i can comprehend ( as opposed to kilograms per year ) .sounds like a high but reasonable consumption level … but also wanted to know sugars : 3.625 * ( 14.4 grams / med banana ) = 52.2 grams of inside-the-banana sugars per day.whether that ’ s optimal or even healthy is another question , but i think we can be pretty sure it ’ s * not * “ very unhealthy ” or they would have some diabetes problem in that country.still , i noticed that the “ 30 bananas per day ” philosophy is 827 % of ( or a 727 % increase ) over the “ high-fruit consuming african countries ” stats showing a bit over 3 and a half banans per day . it might be ( probably is ) healthier than the sad , but … sounds extreme ( also more than 4 or 5 in a half day and my mouth tastes too sweet , based on the very rare times i ’ ve used 4 bananas in a smoothie ( just water and ground flax seed added , no other sweeteners ) but now i ’ m gonna get the wrath of the 30 bananas a day falling on me right ? all i really wanted was to get , mostly a clearer picture of 1776 ( see above comment this replies to ) and sugars in whole foods versus added / refined sugars ( and to get a handle on what those uganda stats meant in “ bananas per day ” terms as supplemental info ) haven ’ t used nf in many months … let ’ s see if i can do html like the charismatic hemodynamics here ? and not sure if i ’ m donig something wrong but why do i need to login with user name and pw at the top right of the website and then separately log in via disquis to comment ? or do i not have to do the former if i do the latter ? why is there so much discussion about fruit when the video is about added sugar ? sorry was trying to make a general comment not reply to econdemocracy.fructose ? i ’ m wondering how much protein you ’ re getting with that % of fruit in your diet . typically , fruit has 1g per serving , many less than that.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / changing-protein-recommendations / i ’ m interested to hear the video too , i have recently started healthy eating and i must say i am so confused about fruit . when i started eating this way , i first had to decide what i was and wasnt going to eat . paleo , vegan , it was all really confusing . finally i made the decision that anything natural i would eat , anything that god gave us to eat basically . i am not a particularly religious person , but i am looking at food in a totally different way . i had a serious sugar addiction and had to kick that , the only way i could give up sugar was to eat sweet fruit , for the first few weeks i overate , i ate a full punnet of strawberries in one sitting and then felt so guilty , hardly daring to goggle how many calories was in a punnet of strawberries , then i had to check twice to make sure it was really only that amount . over the weeks i have calmed down and now only eat fruit twice a day and a huge variety of all different fruits . i ’ m never hungry and have found a real love for fresh produce , fresh veges , huge salads , huge fruit salads . nuts , almond milk , are all changes i am slowly making . i feel better , my health is improving , i am losing 1kg a week with no effort . i find it very hard to believe that we were given these beautiful fruits to eat but they would make us fat ? not sure that makes any sense . i am trying to eat balanced full healthy meals and i intend to keep on including as much fruit as i want . i ’ m also a little tired of the pesticide debate , people are okay about putting toxic ingredients that cant pronounce into their bodies but worry about what might be on their applesi have so many dietary issues that i don ’ t know where to start … .hiatal hernia , type 2 diabetes ( due to losing half of my pancreas to remove a large cyst ) gluten intolerance , reddened esophagus and a colostomy . i hear and read so many conflicting things that i don ’ t know what to believe . my va nutritionist tells me one thing , and the diabetes nurse says the opposite . the doctor , of course prescribes pills . i flushed my metformin , lisinopril , and amlodipine down the toilet in lieu of a plant based diet . my high bp is down , but i still get blood glucose spikes after meals , even though i “ graze ” and get up at 3 am to avoid a dip to 70 or lower in the morning . the “ spikes ” are more like nails as after a meal of 1 / 2 greens , 1 / 4 beans and 1 / 4 meat i go from 90 to 140 after 75 minutes . i ’ m told that this is too high and that bad things will result … .. any help ? i forgot to add : i ’ m six feet even , 140 lbs of muscle and bone . i exercise twice daily after lunch and dinner , drink a pot of coffee and green tea a day . i take vitamin d and wheat grass and milk thistle , and put turmeric on everything . my refined sugar intake is low . i eat no junk food , wheat , restaurant food or milk.i do eat eggs and cheese . i have 2 rum drinks or light beer a day.carter le grand : i think the following book from dr. barnard is just for you ! he did a study that showed that his diet is 3 times more effective at reversing diabetes than the ada

soda , sugar , world health organization are table sugar and high fructose corn syrup just empty calories or can they be actively harmful ? this underscores why a whole foods , plant-based diet is preferable to a plant-based diet that includes processed junk.i ’ ve touched on the harm of refined sugars before in : for healthful alternatives in baking , see the healthiest sweetener , and for beverages , erythritol may be a sweet antioxidant.but what about the fructose in fruit ? how much fruit is too much ? i ’ ll be addressing these questions in a series of videos coming soon . and i ’ ll also be doing more videos on the burgeoning epidemic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and what we can do about it .
PLAIN-2529	juicing removes more than just fiber studies like this , in which harvard researchers found the consumption of whole fruits such as blueberries , grapes , and apples was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes , whereas greater fruit juice consumption was associated with a higher risk , highlight the dramatic difference between eating whole fruits and just drinking fruit juice.if you eat apples , your cholesterol drops , compared to drinking apple juice , but leave just a little of the fiber behind — cloudy apple juice — and it makes a difference.we used to just think of fiber as just a bulking agent that help with bowel regularity . in fact you can get the same laxative effect with indigestible plastic particles . feed people a couple spoonfuls of sliced polyvinyl tubing and you can increase stool bulk , frequency and consistency , so fiber was viewed as a similarly inert , indigestible substance.but now we know fiber is digestible , by our gut bacteria , who make short chain fatty acids out of it , which have a number of health promoting effects , such as inhibiting the growth of bad bacteria , increasing mineral absorption — for example , experimentally infused into the rectum of the human body , they can stimulate calcium absorption . so much so you can improve the bone mineral density of teenagers just by giving them the fiber naturally found in foods like onions , asparagus , and bananas . our good bacteria also use fiber to maintain normal bowel structure and function , preventing or alleviating colonic-based diarrhea , and stimulating colonic blood flow up to five-fold , as well as fluid and electrolyte uptake . the major fuel for the cells that line our colon is butyrate , which our good bacteria make from fiber . so we feed them and they feed us right back.but if the only difference between fruit and fruit juice is fiber , why can ’ t the juice industry just add some fiber back to the juice , sprinkle in a little metamucil . why can ’ t juice with added fiber be equated with whole fruit ? the reason is because we remove a lot more than fiber when we juice fruits and vegetables . we lost all the nutrients that are bound to the fiber.way back in the 80 ’ s a study found a discrepancy as to the amount of fiber in carob using two different methods . there was a gap of 21.5 % that was identified not as fiber but nonextractable polyphenols , a class of phytonutrients thought to have an array of health-promoting effects . in the light of these results , it is worth noting that some of the effects associated with the intake of dietary fiber in plants may actually be due to the presence of these polyphenols.nonextractable polyphenols , usually ignored , are the major part of dietary polyphenols . most polyphenol phytonutrients in plants are locked to the fiber.these so-called missing polyphenols make it down to our colon and are then liberated by our friendly flora , and can then get absorbed into our system . the phytonutrients in fruit and vegetable juice may just be the tip of the iceberg . excellent presentation on a subject so widely discussed and debated . reminds me of a phrase from the past : “ ain ’ t nothin like the real thing ! ” , i.e. the whole fruit and nothing but the whole fruit . god has done a magnificent job , as i often say , and there “ ain ’ t ” nothing you can do ( most generally ) to enhance it . as you have so ably taught us about the 100s / 1000s of phytochemicals / phytonutrients in various foods , and realizing the massive complexitiy of the human body , it would seem essential to realize that our evolution over the eons has not changed that rapidly and we need that variety of fruits , vegetables , et.al. with all the goodies that are included in the original package . thanks again for helping to understand such a delicious and essential topic . i start each of my weekday mornings checking your site , as i think that all of us , as eager students , should.setting god aside for a minute , david , we can understand this a little better . before we were humans we descended from primates , and during that time we had very large muscles in our head to work our jaws . this allowed us to graze on vegetables almost all day . our digestion was also expecting this food , which was fine . however , very recently we lost a single gene of a pair http : / / home.gwu.edu / ~ sherwood / 2006.myh16.reply.jhe.pdf which caused the muscles attached to our skulls to almost disappear overnight . this allowed our craniums to be much larger , but prevented us from chewing at the rate we were accustom . this forced us to consider sweater and meatier options , but our digestions and bodies had not adapted quickly enough for that transition . clearly our bodies and digestions still need the large amount of vegetation , but our jaws can not deliver that much chewing . fortunately , our enlarged brains have allowed us to create blenders and juicers to masticate the food for us . still think god has done a magnificent job , david ? i think god has done a magnificent job and it doesn ’ t help anyone for you to keep insulting her . john slol , i like your perspective john ! i think evolution has don a magnificent job giving sara campos a nice , juicy brain and sharp whits.i ’ m not at all religious but i really think your superior demeanor and deprecating commentary is irksome and unnecessary . the man made a simple comment , he wasn ’ t preaching nor denigrating , unlike yourself . who appointed you resident pedagogue ? genesis 1 : 29well not god obviously.you should read harvard researcher richard wrangham ’ s book , “ how cooking made us human . ” ben : i saw a ted talk once on that topic . it was so interesting ! ( and compelling ) i didn ’ t know there was a book on the same topic . thanks for your post.if we evolved from primates , i wonder why there are still primates ? what ? not sure what your point is david . there is nothing about evolution that suggests evolutionary predecessors must disappear . we ’ re that some arbitrary rule , there would only be one life form on earth . my guess is you could benefit from reading to obtain a better understanding of evolution.scientists predict there will be 9 billion people on the earth by the year 2050 . there are presently 7 billion people on the earth . when i was a kid , there were 5 billion people on the earth . in the year 1950 , there were roughly 2.5 billion people on the earth . 2,000 years ago , there were 300 million people on the earth . notice a trend ? figure it out . it all started with two . nothing significant has changed in the overall process since.and of course those two just happened to be created by the god you happen to believe in . works out nice for you.it started with two ? and their children had incest sex with each other since there were no others yet ? and let ’ s take the science of the bible , sure god knows his own creation ? the bible says the earth is a flat circle , stationary in space , and that the moon is a light source . also , jesus was ok with slavery.um , humans are primates . other modern primates are our evolutionary cousins , not ancestors . carry on.back to topic , i suppose i ’ ll have to start having vodka smoothies instead of having it with orange , cranberry or tomato juice . good video – i thought i was being healthy ! we evolved from a common ancestor shared by both species . time to read a little darwin to understand it better . its really a pretty cool process. lolsure … so .. if dogs evolved from wolfs .. why are there still wolfs .. seriously ? gosh , i don ’ t know . perhaps you should consult your 8th grade biology textbook for the answer , lest you go through life thinking you presented the world with a clever rhetorical question . “ primate ” isn ’ t a species , it ’ s an order of many different species including humans , apes , monkeys , and of course the ones we all evolved from . hope that helps clear your confusion.i am not confused . we set our clocks by the stars.okay.the fact that you didn ’ t understand how there can still be primates if we evolved from ( other ) primates seemed a pretty clear indication of confusion.only an idiot thinks he ’ s smart , the smart person is aware of everything he does not know and might never learn.all hypothesis . no facts presented above . all bold statements with no hard proof . theories being stated as fact . try again.a scientific theory is not the same as a belief . it is far more rigourous with young scientists trying to make a name for themselves by disproving it everyday . been over 150 years since darwin and the evidence only gets stronger . faithheads bore me.you are talking nonsense . how can we have descended from primates . what an insult ! enlarged brains have allowed us to create what ? ? ? obviously you need a little bit more then education , i hope it is not too late for you.there is creation and evolution is the process , miji , just put your god created evolved mind to all the visual evidence . and we are still evolving mostly in the area of conscious awareness , upright posture has left us with knee , back and foot problems . that is so evident , all you have to do is really look and compare . but the variation in near anf far sightedness with the expanded brain loss of heavy jaw muscles are perfect for finding ways to spend less time simply chewing . with thee invention of blenders we now can have the best of both worlds , the garden of eden diet while cruising our asphalt highways.i suppose god went and hid all those sneaky fossils that support darwin . he went to all that trouble just to try and fool us . what a sneaky god. lolthe evidence is overwhelming . time to read a book on transitional fossils . the evidence is overwhelming . too late for what , to be forgiven by your skygod ? sara campos , i didn ’ t follow the link you shared , but you should know that any .edu webpage that contains a ~ in the link contains material not necessarily sanctioned by that institution . in other words , it ’ s probably not a peer-reviewed study , and more likely an opinion piece without primary source references . i ’ m not disputing the information contained in the link , as i did not read it , only mentioning this because it should serve to further enhance your ability to read such articles with a critical eye.god has done a great job on the human body and our earthly nutrition . before daniel was thrown in the lions den , he was tested by the king and god told him to only eat vegetables and fruit while the other men ate from the king ’ s table ( meat ) . when it came to testing the humans , daniel and his friends who only ate vegetables and fruit performed better and looked healthier than people who ate off the king ’ s table . so yeah , god is a great god . if sara wants to believe that her relatives are primates , then let her think that.lol … if we evolved from them , they are our relatives , if god created us all , we would still be relatives , as he would be our father , mother , parent , whatever you want to call it.let me not you forget that evolution uses the same mechanisms that this organization uses . it ’ s called science and unlike your god it ’ s much more reliable and conducive to the well being of the human ( primate race ) . so why ever come here again , when your good book has answered all question regarding nutrition . but it hasn ’ t because you need science.although i like your post and the direction you are heading i feel i must point out that evolution is completely arbitrary . some changes work well , some not so much . there is no grand design or direction . natural selection weeds out the mutations that work and the ones that dont . cheers ! true , but ironically this lack of grand design is evidence ( not proof ) for the lack of god ’ s influence in this process.yea , good job god . cancer , diabeties , stroke , heart attack , alzheimers , . earthly nutrition . how many people died eating plants that were poison until they figured it out . sheesh ! you can ’ t argue with indoctrinated , brainwashed ( fact ) people who hold on to ideas that thrive on gut feeling , discourage common sense and is based on the social , male dominated society of desert tribes.god gave you an pi system that lets both air and food go in , making it possible for you to choke on food and get water in your lunges . perfect design my ass . we are filled with flaws , diseases are no punishment from god but flaws our body cannot defend against.awesome video ! i find it fascinating that most polyphenols in plants are bound to fiber , and when the gut bacteria digest the fiber , they release the polyphenols for our use . fructose has been so maligned recently and it makes so much sense that mother nature got it right by packaging fructose with fiber , polyphenols and other nutrients . wonder what dr. lustig thinks about whole fruit being associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes , since that contradicts his theory that all fructose is bad and causes insulin resistance and fatty liver.i remember dr. lustig saying in a video , “ , the antidote comes with the poison , ” when he was talking about the fiber in fruit and its high fructose content.yes , pat , lustig excludes the fructose in fruit when he speaks of sugar is poison.a couple small but significant digressions to your comments julie . first , i do not remember ever seeing the “ fact ” that “ most polyphenols in plants are bound to the fiber . ” where did this come up ? from everything i have read , most of the phytochemicals are capable of being rendered through the liquidation process of a juicer machine . from what i have seen , other than those bound in the fiber which is a much smaller portion , one can produce a highly concentrated plant-based chemotherapy agent which is comprised of the darkest and brightest produce , with any juicer no matter how efficient they are . coming from someone who ran a juice bar ( santa cruz , 1969 ) , i can say with conviction , a glass of blenderized produce requires significantly less produce than a centrifigal juicer requires for the same size glass . as i said , the best of all is the norwalk juicer which includes both the tricherator function ( which is similar to but inferior to human chewing in terms of the cell breakdown and release of phytochemicals ) and the 2-ton press step ) … .that ’ s a big squeeze which explains the studies as to just how little nutritional value is left behind , but not necessarily worth the near- $ 1000 price tag – that is why most go with the less efficient cheap juicer , especially if they consider all that gourmet “ waste ” being recycled through their compost worms which comes back to us again in the produce we grow with it . anyway , the other point here is that although dr. greger ’ s original article did not address this , people don ’ t chew nearly as efficiently as a machine . although there are inherent advantages such as the spiritual practice of chewing every bite thoroughly , if getting the job done – reversing one ’ s cancer in the most efficient manner , i choose other means of getting the roughage one must also be imbibing ( this is a whole category of kitchen medicine foods ) . as for the fructose ( sugar ) question , this too has been glossed over by default . dr. greger has not positioned himself as primarily a deliverer of anti-cancer food strategies , and if he had , mention would have been made about the universally agreed upon need to keep one ’ s sugar consumption down to a minimum ( 20 % -40 % ? depends upon which alternative oncologist you are listening to , where you are in the cancer proliferation cycle , type , co-existing issues , etc . ) . mutated cells ( cancer ) crave and grow in an acidic , fermentative environment which directly relates to presence of sugar ( or carbs which metabolize more slowly into sugars ) that ’ s why it is so helpful to not forget the celery , cucumber , squashes , leaves , etc. when making any juices which has lots of the sweet stuff in it.not to mention some of us weren ’ t blessed with the greatest of teeth nor the finances to remedy that , so being able to make smoothies with our cheapie blenders daily ( or even juicing if you can afford the machines ) is certainly a better option than bemoaning the past and foregoing the nutrients we would otherwise miss ! yes charzie , i am with you on this point . as a suggestion , if you can find even 2-square feet of space in the sun , i recommend planting any self-sowing , multi-harvest “ green ” – it will prove to be the most cost-effective change you can make in your life . forces us outdoors every day , can be repeatedly harvested , year-after-year , use in soups , stir-fry , smoothies . today i discovered komatsuma ( mild mustard similar to spinach ) growing in a field i planted 3 years ago ! most of the “ asian greens ” naturalize and become immortal and manna from heaven for us.oh yeah ariel , i sure do grow what i can ! i ’ d love to have a bigger garden , but i ’ m limited physically. it ’ s not only cost efficient but it ’ s great to know how it was grown ! i am also big into sprouting and micro-greens , nothing as cool as a garden at your fingertips in days , and a huge variety too ! i also make bread out of sprouted grains , and even use my own wild sourdough instead of buying yeast . my latest passion is cultured foods … making kraut , or any lacto-fermented veggies for probiotics and other benefits ! we have tons of potential food growing wild here ( s florida ) in the form of opuntia cacti , known as nopales , which i often use , and have made great fermented salsa including it . right now i am experimenting with fermenting strips of it by itself … kind of looks like skinny pickles ! fun in my kitchen lab , and the price is sure right ! it makes me furious when i hear people excuse the sad way they eat by saying it ’ s too expensive to eat well , when the opposite is true ! a very interesting topic indeed , i only find it sad that there even needs to be a debate for people to determine whether whole plant foods are the healthiest foods . it seems intuitive to me.i find that people resent it when you criticize their eating habits regardless of their diet.some polyphenols function as prebiotics , selectively feeding beneficial gut bacteria ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) , and as other prebiotics act to reduce gut permeability to endotoxins and systemic inflammation ( 6 , 7 ) , perhaps this accounts for much of the anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetogenic effects of whole fruit . meanwhile , high amounts of the fruit sugar fructose ( also half of table sugar or hfcs ) , when given alone , may increase small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and gut permeability to endotoxins , and the liver injuries of diabetes ( 8 , 9 , 10 ) . it seems nature provides both the peril and prevention for heathy gut flora in the whole fruit , but much of the prevention side is lost with juice.you mention that high amounts of the “ fruit ” sugar fructose appear to increase sibo overgrowth and gut permeability . are whole fruits that are abundant and / or predominant in the sugar fructose capable of doing this , or are you just referring to products that take the fructose out of the whole fruit ? could excess whole fruit cause gut permeability ? i read over the studies you posted and maybe i missed something but i don ’ t think whole fruit was mentioned . but it seems to me that whole fruit might in fact being causative in certain people . thanks.my comment was a consideration of the muraki et al paper , where whole fruit intake decreased diabetes risk while juice increased it , in the light of recent studies on the gut microbiome and metabolic disorders , which i ’ ve been wading into of late.the animal experiments where high fructose intake induced fatty liver and increased plasma endotoxin use refined diets . pure fructose may be added to drinking water , or substituted for starch in food pellets . the only human study to date to support these experiments was the case-control with patients with fatty liver ( 11 ) , where higher fructose intake , presumably mostly from added sugars , was the only dietary variable distinguishing patients from controls ( patients also had higher bmis and exercised less ) .all indication is that whole fruit ( and even some juices ) reduce intestinal permeability and endotoxin exposure . i do have other concerns with fructose , so personally don ’ t consume sugar sweetened beverages , desserts , and choose fruit which have a high polyphenol / calorie ratio , like berries and citrus.thank you . as an aside but related , there was an article published recently in one of the vegan magazines ( read it at bookstore / forget name of magazine / writer ) . the writer stated they were a graduate of the t colin campbell / cornell plant based nutrition course ( i don ’ t remember exact title ) . they claimed that there is the chance that supplemental b12 could feed sibo , thus makes it even worse , as sibo bacteria gobble up our b12.and one would ( i assume ) end up with an even lower b12 eventually ( paradoxically ) and worse symptoms from sibo . thus more weight-loss , muscle-loss , wasting … .all because of b12 supplements . but it seems some vegan diets that are high in fructans / polys etc – fructose fruits , beans and such – might create the issue in the first place . but the b12 is the “ grenade ” . sibo has been shown to gobble up our b12 , this has been credibly established , to my knowledge . have you any insight into this ? i doubt that b12 supplementation would cause sibo , as energy present in the microgram supplemental doses is miniscule . all the papers i ’ ve found that relate sibo to b12 have the causality in the other direction . once sibo is established , the organisms can compete for b12 and other vitamins and prevent their use by the host , and some produce b12 analogues , inactive in humans , that may interfere with true b12 absorption . see : 1 , 2 , 3daryll , that link for “ even some juices ” doesn ’ t seem to be working . what juices are you referring to ? mind re-doing the link ? fixed . i had an extra ” in the anchor html.darryl , have you come across similar studies on other polyphenol rich juices ? the implications seem pretty astounding.here ’ s my collection of dietary intervention studies that appear to reduce gut permeability and plasma endotoxins . a broad variety of polyphenol containing foods ( cocoa , grape seed extract , hops , muscadine grapes , virgin olive oil , orange juice ) , isolated polyphenols ( rutin , puerarin ) , prebiotics found in whole wheat and allium vegetables ( inulin , oligofructose , arabinoxylan ) , and correction of vitamin c and zinc deficiencies all seem to have positive effects.given the limited absorption of polyphenols and generally low plasma concentrations , its possible modulating gut microbiota and barrier function may account for much of their observed antiinflammatory benefits.agreed , juicing alone is not enough unless you have an absorption malady . you need blending too to insure enough fibre . i use an omega masticating juicer which is killer for greens along with a vitamix . cheers ! when i drink a smoothie , i am ingesting everything that i have put into the juicer . is the fiber and all of its benefits still there , or has something been lost due to the action of the blades ? good question . this points to the need for a retraction of this video . he paints a very broad brush against juicing without enough specific information to help us understand why . it would like making a broad statement against cooking , when we know that some foods benefit from cooking and even others have no appreciable impact . juicing , blending ( smoothie ) , cutting , cooking , and eating whole raw will have benefits and drawbacks depending on the food . i think this presentation is an odd ball out considering the nature of his previous work . a focus on the food and methods of preparation for each food is a super approach over demonizing a specific method.disagree sara . nowhere are smoothies mentioned in this , read the transcript it is all about eating the “ whole fruit ” . he consistently reminds us that extracts ( as a juice certainly is ) are almost always worse than the whole food as a general principle ( see vitamins a , c. e ) ; we do need generalities for nutrition since the nutritive qualities have such wide variation even among the same species grown in different parts of the same field and there are so many forward and reverse feedback mechanisms and such a wide variety of gut flora species it is impossible to say one food or one extract will always have only one and just one result . the take away from this is that eating the whole fruit is generally better than juicing in respect of fiber and phyto-woo and that ’ s all you need to know.not that i am agreeing with everything sara is suggesting but in her defense , the “ doctor ’ s notes ” says , “ … this suggests smoothies are preferable . ” don ’ t be that guy … .. ( sighs ) he ’ s saying smoothies , because they have the fiber too , is preferable to juicing . the whole fruit or veggie is preferable to both . those who juice and blend want to believe their liquefied food is better because there is more of it and presumably because it ’ s already liquefied , is more digestible . ( wishful thinking ) dr greger “ generalizes ” because his criticism of juicing is juicing does the same pulp separation job on all plants . the issue isn ’ t whether one pant is good juiced and another is bad . he ’ s saying the act of juicing diminished the nutritional value of all that is juiced … therefore if you ’ re gonna … then blenders and smoothies are the way to go . if your compulsion is in check you ’ re better off eating fresh vegetables and fruits.the smaller the particle , the higher the glycemic index , since there ’ s more surface area and can be digested much more rapidly i.e. mashed potatoes ( 88 ) over whole potatoes ( 72 ) . it ’ s still a potato.i am also certified in plant based nutrition also from ecornell ’ s t. colin campbell course . i worked with and for dr. ann wigmore for over 22 years , and one of the things she was looking for and i ’ m continuing to search for , is a supplier of juicers and blenders with ceramic blades . the metal blades react with the foods . as the food is juiced in a centrifugal machine , and thrown against the wall of the juicer before it ’ s collected in the glass , the electrical charge of it is changed from negative to positive . we need the original negative ions , which for this reason , the gerson ’ s in mexico use a screw type juicer ( naming a champion if one cannot afford a norwalk ) .which apparently , according to them , is the bestseriously ? i doubt dr. campbell distinguishes between positive and negative ions . you picked that jargon up elsewhere . stainless steel is used throughout the medical industry so i don ’ t know why it would be a problem to stir tea or pulverize veggies , if you so desire . on the other hand , no telling what is in ceramic , especially from china . expensive ceramic blades and containers are great for use as melting crucibles and tools but overpriced for pulping veggies . why waste the money ? good point . check out the omega masticating juicers . only revolve at 80 rpm ( as opposed to thousands ) and its pressing mechanism contains no metal and produces no heat and does not oxidize because of the lower speed . i have tried both and the taste says all you need to know . i can juice any green with my omega 900 and it tastes way better than the super fast machines . sure it takes more time but it is a labour of love . do have to add a few carrots to the kale though. lolplease state you source for “ the electrical charge of it is changed from negative to positive . ” thank you.agreed but must add that making a smoothie is eating the whole fruit . cheers ! any thoughts on vegetables needing to be cooked / steamed in order to be properly digested , in today ’ s day and age of our gi tracts ? … .due to protease inhibitors and tannins , amongst other things . i doubt cooking tannin-foods helps , and i ’ ve read that tannins ( in excess ) can compromise digestion / absorption / organs , but i know of asians who feel leafy greens should “ only ” be eaten cooked , for proper digestion and absorption of minerals and vitamins.sara you make good points . if i had to chew raw , cook , or blend my kale i would eat very little of it . however , with my angel juicer i juice carrots and kale together , while i blend my apples in iced white tea with lemon in my vitamix . i combine them for what i consider an enjoyable blended fruit-juiced vegetable drink . this vid makes a good point regarding fruit fiber , but it does not answer the question on vegetable fiber , which many viewers seem to assume is exactly the same . there is another vid where dr. greger makes points on how important mastication is in certain vegetables which seems to be another positive to blending and juicing over normal chewing . chewing to the degree a blender processes seems very unnatural to me , therefore in my opinion juicers for strong leafies and blenders for fruits and some vegetables is both more healthful and convenient.love your comment . are you happy with your angel juicer . too expensive for me so i settled on an omega 900 . john the juicer man compared them both and the difference was not that great although the angel was better . i love the slow speed . i tried a super fast breville with my same 11 veg recipe and i could hardly finish it . there was no comparison in the taste . i attribute it to the insignificant oxidation and heat but have no proof . cheers ! juicing is different than blending a smoothie.i am a juicing and green smoothie junkie ! i have a breville elite juicer and a vitamix blender . in order not to waste the ffiber from juicing i make veggie brownies ! ! so there is still hope to keep your fiber and all the good stuff that comes along with it ! ! ! ! i wouldn ’ t want the calories from eating enough brownies to consume all that fiber.i think since the cloudy apple juice is healthy that smoothies are healthy too.dr esselstein comments on smoothies at http : / / www.dresselstyn.com / site / faq / where he says “ avoid smoothies . the fiber is so finely pureed and rapidly swallowed without the benefits of mixing with helpful bacteria in the mouth . the sugar is separated from the fiber of the fruit , bypasses salivary digestion and results in a surge of glucose . the fructose enhances inflammation , hypertension and endothelial injury . chew your food . ” i recall jeff novick saying something similar about smoothies , that they will spike blood sugar about 10 % more than the whole fruit . so , perhaps making smoothies is only somewhat better than drinking juice.i wonder if pure vegetable smoothies are okay.pat , you posted an excellent comment from dr. esselstein . why would his comment not apply to an all vegetable smoothie ? does the vegetable fiber avoid being “ finely pureed ” ? i ’ m thinking that the lack of sugar in vegetables would diminish the problem described by dr. esselstein as a surge of glucose , along with inflammation , hypertension and endothelial injury . maybe we should chew gum ( sugarless , of course ) to get more saliva in our guts.veggies don ’ t lack sugar .. in fact , the body needs them . when you chew veggies the saliva is ground into the pulverized food and then swallowed . none of that action takes place when you swallow saliva and hope it mixes with the pureed veggies.since the vegetables ( kale , collard greens , celery , etc . ) have less natural sugars than fruit , my guess is they would be okay . maybe for optimum digestion though , you should “ chew ” each mouthful a bit before swallowing.here ’ s a pdf of the fruit / fruit juice / diabetes study : http : / / www.bmj.com / content / bmj / 347 / bmj.f5001.full.pdfthe article is saying whole fruit consumption is good but not fruit juice . yes stay away from fruit juices and make fruit smoothies instead . keep everything together.just like there is chunky and smooth peanut butter , i make chunky smoothies . i pulse once . don ’ t know if this makes any difference or not in slicing and dicing the fiber , but smoothies is where i put all the other stuff , my soy powder , walnuts , flax.i don ’ t think it makes a difference . the fiber is still there . i have a blentec blender and i blend my smoothies to fine particles.are there any studies showing whether blending fruits or vegetables to make a smoothie are less nutritious than eating the food whole ? juicing a fruit usually removes the fiber and other nutrients , but blending fruit keeps 100 % of all the nutrients . the latter just tears up the fiber but all the nutrients are still delivered to the body . my best guess is that blending fruits makes them more easily digestible , and saves a few calories expended over the case of chewing a fruit whole.if the plant is predigested by juicing then doesn ’ t it actually add a few calories ? that ’ s the same problem caused by processed flour. instead of the whole grain being digested for hours the process four , finely ground , therefore exposed to stomach acid , is more easily absorbed into the system . ( maybe we ’ re saying the same thing but differently ? ) what is gained for the vegetally challenged set-me for one-is making vegetable eating a bit more palatable . it has helped me enormously reclaim my health . but i am worried just in case the argument is correct that pulverizing is harmful.good point , neal . i suppose if i had trouble downing vegetables then pulverizing hem would be much better than no veggies . peanut butter was invented for folks with no teeth . but i don ’ t understand how one person can consume veggie juice but not vegetables … unless they have some gastric problem . if it ’ s just a matter of not liking vegetables , well , taste preference s = change easily when the taste buds are rejuvenated by abstaining form meat and diary . veggies explode with flavor ! funny , when i was a kid , mom didn ’ t ask if i wanted kfc or mcdonalds tonight . she fixed dinner and that included veggies . she didn ’ t consult me for my favorites . i ate what was placed on the table and it never occurred to me i had the option to not like a vegetable . while i didn ’ t care for brussel sprouts i choked them down anyway . today i love ‘ em . today , young mothers are manipulated by media to think they have to hide the veggies . that means they mix a small amount of veggies with bacon or cheese . could that be why their kids are obsess ? it ’ s true that i don ’ t enjoy vegetables as much as meat . however , seeing the compelling health benefits of meat , i used vegetable juicing as a means of eating quantities of vegetables and replacing meat and glycemic carb consumption . seemed to work . seemed to also result in a greater abiity to eat vegetables . however , it ’ s extremely unpalatable for me to eat raw kale-but juicing kale with tumeric , ginger , black pepper and lemon makes a nice satisfying drinkable means of drinking good quantities of healthy kale . i wish i liked the veggies more . but juicing seems to help a bit for someone raised on soda pop , french fries , hamburgers , kfc , and so on.no need to be concerned , vegetables that are whole but blended will give you the same benefits . let ’ s not get crazy . : ) dr. joel fuhrman recommends in fact to blend vegetables like kale , to get all the benefits , since it is dubious that we chew enough to make it really absorbable.either way , you ’ ll get benefits.thule , your quote of dr. fuhrman is different form the dr. greger vis = seo talking about blended greens . it lacks saliva , important for digestion … unless you spit in the blender . the benefits form fiber is also lost . who knows how harmful it is to the body ’ s organs as they try to sort out what ’ s going on when they are confronted with glutinous amounts of liquid nutrient to digest.i bet that since you don ’ t chew your food causing it not to be absorbed , the reasonable solution isn ’ t to start chewing but to process your food ? so dr. fuhrman is on record claiming there is no trade off when food is liquefied instead of chewed ? keep in mind he advocated up to three servings of meat weekly . he ’ s not my go-to guy on all things vegan . especially since he earns a living selling supplements . does he sell blenders too ? i can honestly say i never thought about “ spitting ” in my smoothie . but maybe that would help in the salivary digestion process since i don ’ t drink it right away . i ’ ll probably just say , “ i added some amylase ” and leave it at that.tedstar , just thinking outside the spittoon … some are anal about smoothies not having the saliva in chewed food . i bet many do smoothies because they believe it provides some extra protection against the damage done by meat and dairy . i ’ m guessing if you don ’ t eat meat and dairy then you don ’ t need the perceived extreme protection .. then again , if you do eat meat and dairy , there ’ s no science saying the extra nutrients are going to win the battle against rogue cancer cells going postal . if you don ’ t swallow the poison you don ’ t need the super antidote.larry : i haven ’ t done meat / dairy in over 19 yrs but don ’ t see any reason not to do the super antidote . it ’ s pretty easy , palatable , makes me feel great , is easy on the planet , and most importantly doesn ’ t exploit animals.you and i aren ’ t a statistic . i know a woman ( meat and dairy eater ) who puts four or five blueberries on her cereal . she argues it won ’ t do any harm and it makes her feel good . she believes those few blueberries are protecting her . if the population of meat eaters think similarly , they won ’ t realize their poor choice until the meat has taken its toll . monkey see , monkey do.perceived extreme protection . you go ahead and down that safe steak and healthy glass of milk. loltake that back , did not read your next post , regards . gregwhere do you think that saliva , which is produced nonstop , goes when you swallow it . into your stomach containing an already broken up green that is way more blended than your mouth could ever do . unless of course you can chew as fast as a blender.neal , i ’ ve known a lot of meat eaters who are sick from eating animals but they still choose to take medication to hide the symptoms and they continue to eat meat.i bet if you ate chicken wings without the bbq sauce , and fish without seasoning , and the same for red meat , you might not like the taste so much . millions create their own myths about how to avoid meat and dairy diseases ( eat some kale or broccoli ) , but never have i met someone who believe meat has compelling health reason to consume . we ’ re each an unfinished book . it ’ s only afterwards the fiction story becomes non-fiction as others look back on the lives we led . only then is the true perspective seen . to each his own.we do agree on kale . i don ’ t enjoy eating it . but kale is just one of many healthy plants , most we don ’ t even know about.larry , i agree 100 % . there was no questioning of what what served at dinner , lunch , bfast time . it was there , and you ate it . the thought that a child can manipulate the mother like you mention is unreal . but then , i don ’ t live around young families . the mother , and dad , set the stage early in the child ’ s eating habits . i suppose outside forces , like school , etc contribute , but it starts at home ! i guess i ’ m lucky i grew up when there wasn ’ t fast food.jackie , what ’ s missing is the “ conventional roles ” parents once played in their children ’ s upbringing . in my opinion woman have been “ liberated ’ so they can work and add to the billionaires ’ bottom line . there was a time when one parent worked and paid the bills . now it takes both parents , government programs , and charity to put food on the table because the parent ’ s money goes to pay for cheap plastic thingies made in china ( and now expensive chinese apple products ) along with catastrophic medical bills form eating the cheap food . isn ’ t it ironic young people expect to pay five or six hundred dollars for a “ telephone ” and then used one finger to type out a text message like it ’ s morris code ? there was a time when telephones were owned by the monopoly and provided “ free ” to the subscribers … they never broke down . my parent had the same black phone for thirty years . i ’ m not saying bring back the good old days , i ’ m just observing how manipulated we are today by media . our goal today is to make more money to buy some new version of the thing we bought a year ago . any economy reliant on that sort of consumerism is built on a house of cards.the only ground roots solution i see is for “ men ” to assume responsibility for their families and stop feeding their children poisonous foods . as it , the mindset is rachael ray portrays a dutiful wifey who fixes her man , john , the pork chops with white beans and sausage he wants . she professes a subservient roll but in reality she ’ s just an actress portraying what the meat and dairy industries want american women to mirror . men need to tell their wifes , “ let ’ s eat healthy , i don ’ t want meat and dairy … i ’ m tired of the food police deciding my children should eat their poison.well , speaking as a “ liberated ” woman , it was very , very difficult to be a great mother . i spent 7 years at university , and wasn ’ t about to “ waste ” that on being a “ stay at home mom ” . and i did not . i did have a daughter , but i sure wasn ’ t the mother that my mom was , who did not work ever . yes , there was a time when the working husband could generate enough income to take care of the family in pretty good style . but … those days are gone . i stayed at home with my daughter when she was young until we were just about bankrupt , and it wasn ’ t because of those cheap plastic thingies , this was in the early 70 ’ s . it was the basics . so , it ’ s a hard choice , but the women are continuing in their education , professional jobs , etc . there is no turning back.not suggesting women should play a subservient role . just pointing out how society has been manipulated by industry through media to attack historical ( and evolutional ) conventions to maximize american workforce participation and corporate profits . now that everyone ’ s busy working to pay the bills , no one has time to cook dinner , or lunch , or even breakfast . the corporations sell us all the unhealthy “ food ” they can manipulate us to buy . government feeds out kids once or twice each day in accordance to the meat and dairy industries mandates . what has society gained ? seems to me one income should pay the bills and the second should allow the industrious couple to accumulate wealth . instead we pay for the services and conveniences we need in order to be a two income family . .nowhere does the video say its harmful .. perhaps it is missing in some lost benefits that eating or blending may convey . but harmful . not . i juice and i blend and i eat . love them all . juicing , especially greens is for those who want a large dose of green goodness that would be impossible to consume otherwise . cheers ! only at high speeds which oxidize and heat . check out john the juicer on youtube and the omega or greenstar masticating juicers . slower , but a labour of love . cheers ! larry , flour is more than just “ pulverized ” wheat . or , guess i should say less . they take almost all the nutrients out , the fiber , etc . that ’ s why they call it “ enriched ” , is because they add all the vitamins back in , ( but not the fiber ) after they ’ ve taken them all out . so , no , don ’ t think there ’ s any correlation here . but , yes , the finer a food is ground , the higher the glycemic index is , like pureed potatoes compared to just a whole potato . think that ’ s why steel oats is better than instant. etc . agree on the juicing . nothing to be gained by drinking orange juice , in my estimation . high sugar and no fiber to “ temper ” .jackie , i read about white flour many moons ago … as a teen . i still remember the line about white “ enriched ” flour being so void of nutrition that insects wouldn ’ t even eat it . i have to refrigerate ( or freeze ) my bulk whole grains to keep insects from eating them . any amount left out becomes food and nesting grounds for all types of small critters that crawl and fly . but , no insect ever gets in whit flour . they know it ’ s not food … but we don ’ t.i used to buy steel cut oats but to save much moola started buying groats in fifty pound bags . lintels and flaxseed come in twenty-five pound bags . my pets are healthy due to the ground flaxseed.i skip the oj but do add some lemon juice concentrate to my drinking water.appreciate the headzup on the groats , and , like you , i would like to buy oat groats , but here in lima , peru , is difficult for me . i see “ traigo ” groats , which is wheat , but because of my spanish language limitation , cannot seem to find anything but wheat or barley groats . and , my storage space is serverly limited , but , that ’ s ok , because at the markets here , i can walk everyday and buy what i need . the first image is a typical “ stall ” in the market that sells “ dry ” products . it ’ s all there , everything . and almost free . the 2nd image is wheat , by the way , 2.80 soles in a $ , so that ’ s about $ 1.75 for a kilo , 2.2 lbs . the rear “ bin ” is “ instant ” oatmeal , i can really find nothing else . i think it ’ s about 4 soles a kilo too . so eating beans , lentils , grains , is a slam dunk.sounds like peru would be a great place to retire . food seems to be dirt cheap ! if steel cut oats are as cheap as the other foods then maybe groats aren ’ t so important / if you seek groats , keep in in they may be sold as “ horse feed ” . i used to ride quite a lot and my horse wouldn ’ t go back in the stable without first flipping the feed bin door open and grabbing a bite of groats before he was put in his stall . they ’ re the same groats i buy in bulk for human consumption . here in the usa veggie burgers made with beans and rice and rolled oats is pretty tasty . also , everyone seems to crave , “ mock tuna ” . i have it weekly . i sometimes have the soy protein burgers and mock turkey … al of it makes good sandwiches . i recently ( last year ) discovered a “ new ” condiment , “ slawsa ” . it ’ s cabbage ( slaw ) with spices . it comes in glass jars ( relatively small company ) in tow varieties , “ regular ” and ‘ spicy ” . i put hem on vegan burgers and vegan hot dogs … and any sandwich . i may try reverse engineering the recipe and make my own . i haven ’ t heard anyone else talk about it . i ’ m surprised lindsay nixon or one of the orhte vegan chefs hasn ’ t already come up with their recipe for slawsa.yes , fruits / veggies / fish is dirt cheap here . strawberries now in season , about $ 1.30 a kilo ! and , mangoes are back too . i love them . no , there is no chance to get any soy pretend thing , burger , hotdogs , nothing . and anything imported , like peanut butter , is pricy . so , the slawsa isn ’ t even available . but , we have bunches of soy beans , and have made my own soy “ milk ” before . guess i could just progress and make my own “ soy burger ” or what . but , i don ’ t have room in my stomach for that , after the 40g fiber that i try to ingest every day . but , thx for headz up as usual . i might just make it back to u.s. one day and have need for the advice.could not be more wrong . you can get the benefit of a whole head of kale , carrots , spinich , swiss chard , apple , ginger , garlic , celery , cabbage , parsley , i use 11 different veggies , … in one big glass of juice . i could send you a pic of the size of the veggies i cut up and good luck eating them all at once. lolnot sure about nutrition but a while ago i came across this study which compared a whole apple , puree , and juice and as expected the whole apple provided the most satiety followed by the puree and then the juice : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19110020i agree . you hit the nail right on the head . but juicing is good for people with digestive maladies or those who want a shot of the * good stuff * , especially greens . but you need blending as well . plenty of other ways to get fibre . cheers ! dr. essie is a wonderful leader regarding nutrition . i think he is a little off here . i would look into dr. fuhrman ’ s thoughts … .blending gives so many more surfaces for digestion to take place . chewing is good … .. ” chew your smoothies ” … .but the digestive process is so complex , it is one part … .and with so much goodness in what is in the smoothies / especially compared to what so many others eat / for one it is more likely that we will consume the combination / and may not have the time to chew through a bushel of such foods . julieanna hever , too has some great insights regarding smoothies , and one of my very favorites , who used green smoothies to recover from cancer : caryn hartglass , real , responsible eating and living / many great podcasts / and talks about greens on her homepage ; a big fan of fuhrman ’ s and greger ’ s . check out nutritionfacts.org.check out the “ raw family ” / green smoothies are their forte : https : / / www.google.com

essylstyn may , therefore , as so often is the case be shooting from the hip on this smoothie issue . but so are the supporters . it seems that unless there are studies about non-fruit smoothie drinkers vs. veggie eaters that are long term we won ’ t know for sure.in juicing you lose all the fiber . blending you eat everything.not quite … in juicing you lose most of the “ insoluble fiber ” … .but … not so with the “ insoluble fiber ” … some of the best fiber around ! i am not sure how accurate that is . a cup of raw , unprocessed orange juice only contains 0.5 grams of fiber. http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / fruits-and-fruit-juices / 1971 / 2where as an orange of near equal caloric value contains 5-6 grams of fiber http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / fruits-and-fruit-juices / 1966 / 2i think he is wrong . i have been making smoothies and live of mostly fruit and veggie smoothies since i adopted a plant based diet 3 years ago . since that time i haven ’ t been sick . before that i was sick all the time . since a kid i have had issues with nasal and chest congestion , and would get a cold and the flu often . since i adopted a plant base diet revolving around mostly making fruit and vegetables smoothies i have lost and kept of nearly 30 lbs . a lot of that weight was in my intestines . i consume around 2600 calories a day and 1800-2000 of that is from fruit smoothies . my blood results have been coming back as excellent since i adopted a plant based diet and my sugar levels and my cholesterol levels are excellent . actually everything is on the excellent side . at 47 years old i am back boxing and i box most of the times with kids in their 20 ’ s and my stamina and conditioning are much better than theirs , and my stamina and conditioning was not like that before i adopted a plant based diet . the knock on smoothies is a bunch of garbage . i will be boxing in tournaments and in order to do so i had to do a stress test and i had to pass a diabetes test and other age and health related test to allow me to box at my age . the dr was amazing and said my heart reacts like a 20 year old . the blood sugar spike is bull . all sugars spike you blood , but whole fruits and smoothies don ’ t keep it spiked . i am going to go on a campaign to have these dr ’ s put their money where there mouth is and challenge them on health and physical tests of any kind . don ” t listen to these people . make your fruit smoothies . at 47 i know stay energized through the whole day . my mind is clear , my breathing is clear , my heart and lungs are super strong.you may be correct , but i found that i had to eliminate the fruit smoothies , because my blood sugar did spike the next day . that was true even though i was using mostly berries which have a bit less sugar . so i am only drinking green smoothies now , and eating my fruit.did you try making your smoothies with more than just fruits ? any nuts or seeds will lower the gi . consider adding cocoa ( i use raw cocoa ) , and other ingredients , no just fruits . i make them with oat milk.if you just washed your teeth before your breakfast smoothie , you wouldn ’ t have bacteria in your mouth anyway . there is the part of mixing food with your salivary enzymes , and that i guess can be important ( if you aren ’ t taking enzyme supplements ) so one must resist the urge to just gulp down the smoothie , if you take your time , you should get the benefits , plus in general you ’ ll be able to eat more fruit and / or vegetables than you would otherwise , and as dr. greger says , eat them the way you ’ ll eat the most ! also i think a good strategy is to add some ingredients in the smoothie that will lower the glycemic index , for example flax and chia seeds.i agree . this has been a concern of mine with juicing , blending , etc . dr gregor has touched upon this in one video that i know of . he talked about how a compound is created only when chewing broccoli in your mouth which has beneficial detoxifying effects on the liver . like is said , digestion starts in the mouth … but you gotta chew ! the main benefit of juicing and blending produce is that people who normally wouldn ’ t consume this much are doing so with these devices . so , it may in fact be a net gain . and you see the stories of healing from juicing . my guess is this is due to flooding the body with nutrients which may not be possible from simply chomping down whole fruit . granted , they are missing the nutrients dr gregor mentions but , again , it ’ s a net gain.well , if you lose all the fiber , i ’ d think it ’ s more than “ somewhat better ” .i make a breakfast smoothie with fruit , nuts , ginger , kale and water . this keeps me satisfied until lunch.going through bouts with trigeminal neuralgia thus regular food intake is impossible due to pain . got myself a nutribullet and throw all veggies ( raw ) and fruits in . contains all fibers just in liquid form . never keep it is the fridge make only what i consume . open to suggestions . thank you.what might be wrong with refrigerating it ? harryi have found that it keeps for a day in the refrigerator . outside of hte refrigerator , it seems to quickly begin to ferment as evidenced by an increasing evervescence and slighlty sour taste.apparently once fruits and vegetables are ground up , as in a juicer or blender , the mixture immediately starts to oxidise and lose its vitamin and mineral content.i found that i had to switch to vitamix from nutribullet . makes the mixture smoother and more palatable.sadly , his video was about juicing no blending ; you are fine . it seems most folks here misunderstood the word juicing . he may have benefited the viewer by showing a typical juicer to illustrate his point . a bender is not a juicer . in your case a nutribullet is a great tool and i use it a lot to blender fruits and vegetables for easier consumption . in fact i recall the dr. mentioning that he makes a smoothie with habiscus tea in one of his videos.i find that putting together a veg / fruit smoothie to be quite rewarding . from spinach and kale , to adding in the various berries , i find that i am receiving what i feel to be quite fiber rich . i make it in the nutribullet or the ninja , not disposing of any of the fiber that we see getting thrown out with the advertised juicers . there are small bits that come through the straw as well . in addition , i am satiated for much longer . that does not mean i eliminate chewing on an apple or enjoying an orange , but the fact that i can make something healthy in the way of what i call a smoothie , has the necessary health benefits that i can appreciate . i do not agree that i am losing health benefits since i am not disposing of any fruit or vegetable fibers.dr greger argued here for smoothies towards the end . i heard someone say that the smoothies make sugars too readily available . any substance to the claims ? or is it possible that the smoothies can somehow make the phyto-nutrients to easy to access . anyone ? certainly more sugar is freed when blended . that ’ s why carrot juice tastes sweeter than carrots . but hey , if that ’ s the way you get more whole vegetables and fruits in your body , it is far , far better than not consuming them.well , i love my smoothies , although only pulse 1 time , so i call them ¨ crunchies ¨ . was worried about breaking up the fiber chains , and nulling it . i ´ ve read , don ´ t have the source , sorry , that grinding the fruit up and breaking the fiber up is inconsequential , that your mouth does the same thing , more or less . i ´ m still gonna make ´ em , though , but just 1 pulse . half fiber chains this way. ha ha . and maybe there ´ s a point in the slower digestion time in the whole fruit instead of the ground up stuff . makes sense.the good doctor seems to be talking about store bought juices . i ’ ve read lots about all the good being removed from such juices . i would like to see something about juicing your own fruits and veggies . i have been juicing my own for about 8 months now and have lost about 30 pounds , have much more energy and have never felt better . i think he is giving juicing a bad rap without stating all the facts.i wish you had made a distinction between juicing fruits verses vegetables . sure , juicing fruits is a bad idea considering the sugar levels and the need to retain the fiber for glucose regulation . however , vegetables have nutrients that are actually blocked by fiber . which is why many tend to juice some vegetables in an effort to extract those nutrients and remove the blocking affect that fiber has in digestion . at this point i am getting a bit concerned with the flip / flog nature if these presentations . not long ago you spoke of the value of kale juice . am i supposed to now believe the kale juice is less nutritious than eating kale directly . please refrain from stigmatizing juicing except when speaking specifically about a fruit or vegetable with supporting evidence . a general statement against juicing vegatibles runs counter to all the current information we have seen to date , and is very unnerving . “ vegetables have nutrients that are actually blocked by fiber . ” source ? any studies that prove this claim ? http : / / cdn.intechopen.com / pdfs-wm / 40600.pdf page 12 , 6.1 . nutrients absorption . this study is typical of the well known impact of fiber on nutrient uptake , which is negative . this is why some folks choose to incorporate vegetable juicing . i personally don ’ t live on a liquid diet , but i do enjoy the benefits of an occasional vegetable juice , just for this reason.i think that fiber probably does reduce the uptake of nutrients , but i think dr. greger has presented numerous great arguments for fiber nonetheless . this video presents additional ones.ultimately , very little is proven about diet with much specificity . some generalities seem well supported , including the benefits of high fiber plant based diets for overall health and reduction of chronic illness . so i think arguing against fiber is almost silly.i recently saw the chief of endocrinology at mcgill university medical school . i told him i seemed to be beating my diabetes with lots of green leafy vegetables in smoothies . he said “ spinach has too much nitrites ( he may have said nitrates ) ” . you shouldn ’ t eat so much . a resident who was one of his students said “ it ’ s only the nitrates from prepared meats that are bad . not the green leafy ones . ” thus correcting him , and earning his great enmity.so arguing against the prevailing evidence and therefore against fiber consumption , or advocating against a plant based diet is probably incorrect.yeah mainly in the cellulose i think because we dont have the enzyme cellulase like herbivores ~ i think it ’ s safe to trust the bacteria in our gut to free those nutrients from the fiber . what if many of those nutrients get destroyed by stomach acid if freed instead in a blender ( if that can even be effective in “ freeing ” for most of them ) , and can ’ t reach the small or even large intestine to be absorbed in the right areas of the gut ? http : / / cdn.intechopen.com / pdfs-wm / 40600.pdf page 12 , 6.1 . nutrients absorption . this study is typical of the well known impact of fiber on nutrient uptake , which is negative . this is why some folks choose to incorporate vegetable juicing . i personally don ’ t live on a liquid diet , but i do enjoy the benefits of an occasional vegetable juice , just for this reason . also see dr. garson ’ s research on the benefits of vegetable juicing on cancer.sara , i completely agree that much more clarification needs to be made by dr greger in future videos concerning this issue of juicing vs blending ( smoothies ) , and fruits vs veggies used . i am curious about how much science-backed information is out there on this subject.it appears that others are as well.i appreciate your support . an up vote is always welcome.i ’ m curious about coffee . as i understand it , coffee has a lot of antioxidant polyphenols . so much in fact , that it is the # 1 dietary sources for many people . but drip brewed coffee has no fiber . how do the polyphenols get out of the coffee beans an into the liquid coffee if they are bound to the fiber in the beans ? would ground coffee beans have a lot more polyphenols than the brewed coffee , and if so , would it be better to consume them ? ever since i ’ ve gotten my blendtec , i ’ ve been eating far more veggies and fruits . for example , this morning i had a serving each of blueberries , carrots , spinach and broccoli … i ’ m probably getting 10 or more servings a day in now.i ’ ve never felt more energetic.people are saying that pulverizing fruits / veg removes nutrition , but i ’ m not convinced . where does it all go then ? one word : vitamix ! best thing i ever bought ! you probably know rich roll – i think he was the guy who once blended an avocado pit in his vitamix – and drank it … … ewww.i have a love-hate relationship with my vitamix , but it is more on the love side . i ’ ve recently had the opportunity to get to know a blend-tec too . while the blend-tec has some advantages over the vitamix , in the end , i decided i liked my vitamix much better . i thought i would share this in case someone is making such a purchasing decision now and wants a personal opinion.i ’ m never able to say in one word what could be said in a few hundred instead.this is out of the transcript . hope it helps the confusion.studies like this , in which harvard researchers found the consumption of whole fruits such as blueberries , grapes , and apples was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes , whereas greater fruit juice consumption was associated with a higher risk , highlight the dramatic difference between eating whole fruits and just drinking fruit juice.if you eat apples , your cholesterol drops , compared to drinking apple juice , but leave just a little of the fiber behind — cloudy apple juice — and it makes a difference.nonextractable polyphenols , usually ignored , are the major part of dietary polyphenols . most polyphenol phytonutrients in plants are locked to the fiber.these so-called missing polyphenols make it down to our colon and are then liberated by our friendly flora , and can then get absorbed into our system . the phytonutrients in fruit and vegetable juice may just be the tip of the iceberg.that is the best ever video , ever , ever , ever ! getting this information is key to eating whole foods and answers so many questions that come up about the why of eating whole , unrefined and unprocessed foods . thank you ! i am in line with the comments regarding the demonizing of juicing in all circumstances and for all purposes . let ’ s be clear : by far , it is nearly always better to personally process ( chew ) the whole food in as close to its originally harvested form . however , like a few of these comments imply , the devil is in the details , and there are circumstances and purposes where this is not the best way to consume the specific phytochemicals needed from produce and that purpose is when one is treating cancer . if the drinker is relatively healthy , daily maintenance smoothies with produce in it , is sufficient . you will be getting far fewer produce items per day and this will not be very expensive for a huge improvement from the sad . but when the drinker happens to be in the position of needing to use plant phytochemicals to reverse actively growing cancer , then this is a whole other reality and the intervention plan needs to reflect this difference . here ’ s how this difference in processing produce can turn an excellent daily smoothie habit into a top-tier cancer treatment protocol … … when you are in the beginning stages of a self-administered cancer reversal diet ( approximately the first few months ) , when everyone around you is saying you ’ re crazy for not going down the conventional treatment route , you need to set yourself up for some immediate positive results . it ’ s a matter of personal psycho-spiritual survival and its a great way to shut everyone up so you can concentrate on what you are doing – it will take a year of intense focus , retraining , and diverted resources – you did not get cancer overnight and the changes are on multiple fronts – not simply taking your silver bullets on time or showing up for chemotherapy sessions . the fastest way to shrink a tumor ( or reverse internal cancer symptoms , blood work , or diagnostic tests ) is to exponentially increase one ’ s consumption of the brightest colors of raw produce . this concept is not an internet entrepreneur ’ s pipedream ; it is at the core of every credible alternative cancer treatment center ’ s program . it is these dark / bright colors in produce which are the universally agreed upon principle treatment for reversing any cancer , and this is true the world over where people have been flying for treatment for decades , as well as with the high-end alternative cancer treatment centers evolving here in na . sure , if you have mega-bucks you can probably speed things up with any of a long list of adjunct therapies and doctor-formulated supplements , but the universal agreement is raw fruits and vegetables – lots of raw fruits and vegetables . how does one consume the highest doses of the brightest colors which are the actual medicines which reverse cancers ? by using a high quality extracting juicer . the top-of-the-line is the 2-ton norwalk press which has been shown to extract calcium out of carrots for example , leaving a very small mass of colorless , dry cellulose for your compost heap . but even a cheap centrifigul juicer bought at wal-mart will accomplish the same thing , albeit less cost-effectively because extractive juicing will enable you to consume exponentially more phytonutrients each day . there is just no way you could consume the volume of the deeply colored “ juice ” from greens ( parsley / kale / spinach ) , purples ( eggplant skin / purple cabbage / dark berries ) , reds , oranges , yellows ( berries / beets / pomegranate / peppers / squash ) , and lots of white ( garlic , celery , cucumbers ) . with this level of consumption of bright colors , nearly overnight , you can see cancer cells leaving your body and can prove it with blood work , visual exams , symptoms reversing this method of “ juicing ” : costs more for sure ( you will be going through a bushel of organic produce per day , not a basket ) , but this will still be a tiny fraction of what you would be charged for this service at your better alternative cancer treatment centers – think of it as paying yourself to do your own world-class alternative cancer treatment protocol by yourself , for yourself , and to yourself for pennies on the dollar . there are literally thousands of people all over na doing this as we speak , and what they are doing is saturating their body for weeks on end , with the most concentrated doses of plant phytochemicals known to cure cancer ( do your own research , own your plan , empower your life away from the medical-pharmaceutical-hosptial industrial complex ) . later on , you can back off of the expensive juicing task ( takes hours / day ) , and can increase your whole food consumption . this is because the cancer cells are leaving your body faster than they are replicating and so the more dilute method of consuming these highly effective alternative phytochemotherapeutic dosages – through consuming the whole food – stir-fries , salads , even cooked veggies / soups will become your maintenance dose of phytochemicals . the fact is that when you need to use plants to reverse cancer , it is an immediate demand to get the highest doses of the brightest colors that produce can supply into our bloodstream the fastest and for an extended period of time , days on end . these phytochemicals work ! they work for prevention and they work for the cure . it is true that adding key anti-cancer herbs / roots / barks / flowers / berries / mushrooms will increase the speed of a produce-juice daily regimen , but think about it : schizandra , turmeric , reishi , amla , etc . , are vegetables too ( just less flavorably mild than carrots , blueberies , etc . ) . if you already have cancer , you will need an exponentially higher level of the phytonutrients known / shown to reverse cancer cell growth in the fastest , most consumable way and other than distillation with heat or alcohol ( denaturing ) , raw whole food extractive juicing is the # 1 method to consume “ juice . ” in one day of an intense cancer-reversal regimen , one can easily drink the juice ( fresh extracted method is best such as with a norwalk press ) from a bushel of produce , taking care to dilute down to around 40 % carb with use of celery , leaves , cucumbers so the sugars of beets / carrots / apples do not cause insulin spikes . so , sacrificing some phytonutrients ( that are bound in the fiber by using a blenderized whole food juicing process ) is a small price to pay to stop cancer growth immediately . you would never be able to consume these medicinal levels of the best anti-cancer phytochemicals in any other way . don ’ t get me wrong – i make and depend upon my quick whole food blender type smoothies for my everyday purposes of increasing my produce consumption , providing additional fiber , and getting more of what only whole plants can provide – phytonutrients . what i am outlining here is another purpose for these desired phytochemicals , and that is to elevate them to the level of being a phytochemotherapeutic agent which will out-perform any big pharma product on the market . and this expensive , wasteful practice of using extractor-type machines which leave behind terrific worm bin food , will not create a cancer treatment bill you will be paying off for the rest of your life , will not damage your organs and immune function as standard chemotherapy and radiation does , and as has been shown / reported recently in mainstream media , a phytochemotherapy approach to healing oneself of cancer will increase your overall lifespan and quality of life after your self-designed phytochemotherapy period ends and you return to just being a daily whole food smoothie person.what a great presentation , ariel , my grandfather , long ago in the fifties ( i ’ m 73 ) , said that the best diet is to include at least 3 different colors of vegies each day . your account also corresponds with my own experiences coping with “ cancer ” . i was diagnosed with stage 4 throat cancer about four years ago . i consulted ten oncologists during this time . some of the docs marveled that i was still alive . but none seemed to take into account the relatively clean and sensiblie exercise and nutritional program i had been using . i ate , blended , juiced fresh vegies and fruits with some backyard weeds , and grains , dairy and meat . the docs offered five distinct treatment protocols . all were variants of the slash , burn and poison variety . they seemed to ignore my relatively good health and dismissed my view that the primary tumor had begun to shrink after three and a half years . that was only half the story . and , we must not be bound by any dogma … .. and always remain alert to our changing world . in my case , the secondary neck tumor had continued to grow to the size of a jumbo avocado . yeah . nothing i did seemed to slow its growth . so , i finally agreed to be shot by the new proton radiaion gun , wherein the radiation can be precisely directed . after one third of the shots , i quit … .. fearing the cancer would spread , as it often does , to my lungs or brain . i haven ’ t looked back since … . though my doc said that quitting was worse then having no radiation at all . in fact , the primary throat tumor continued to shrink and now it seems to have finally died . the large neck tumor has shrunk to the size of a small prune . and all is well . so … .eat well and stress not , for that is the real killer . and for those of us that cannot afford a norwalk … .i would suggest getting an old vegie grater . you can grate carrots , apples , peppers , garlic , celery , etc. to almost applesauce consistency.this video could be misinterpreted so need some clarification dr g. are we talking about fruit juices as found in store shelves versus extracted from a juicer ( masticating or centrifugal ) ? the latter form of juicing does preserve the soluble fiber in fruits and veggies and removes only the insoluble bulk fiber does it not ? are these polyphenols attached to the bulk fiber or the soluble fiber ? those of us who juice know that when an apple or orange is juiced using one of the above forms of juicing the resulting juice looks nothing like that found in the bottles at the store which are presumably squeezed . i doubt juicing can be dismissed so easily . would love to hear your thoughts.good post . i use an angel juicer ( masticating type ) and the vegetable juices it produces are dense , dark , and strong . i generally don ’ t do fruit juices because they are more fun in smoothies or just to eat . however , veg juices are very nutritious as you pointed out . think this video may need to be retracted.i agree sara . i do throw in the occasional apple when i juice veggies but fruit hours on smoothies for sure our eaten . i have seen many shows that involve md panels who denounce juicing based on this all in one fiber theory . i am sure dr g had some thoughts on this but anyone who had heard of jay kordich knows juicing veggies is good : - ) do you give yourself coffee enemas , too ? troll alert : - ) loser aler.loser alert . you ’ re the one who can ’ t cite evidence , ya putz.notation : i am deleting your posts . you are breaking posting rules for this site . no name calling . also note : if your posts are not polite , your posts are not appropriate.so you do give yourself coffee enemas ! good to know ! ! ; ) what ’ s the matter , ravi ? are you upset ? why ? is it because you couldn ’ t refute the sources i posted ? gee , i ’ m so very sad for you . you ’ re a self-aggrandizing little twenty-something whose mommy and daddy are paying his way through charlatan-school , and you ’ re all fussed because you ’ ve been called out on your claims . is that about right ? why aren ’ t you on the front lines fighting ebola where it ’ s most deadly , honey ? get some balls and go to where the action is . try your woo over there ! i ’ d love to see you battling ebola with vitamin c and juicing ! ! hahahahahahahah.loser alert.i see you can ’ t manage to show a single thing i ’ ve posted to be false , loser.you poor little boy.ah ! so you do ! wow . i never met anyone who did that.what a weirdo.ii see you ’ ve been unable to refute the information i linked for you , ravi.go be a real doctor.some forget that as we age , our digestive and absorptive efficiency decreases , due to decreased production of enzymes and acids . this fact would therefore make predigestive food preparation , such as blended smoothies , more likely to provide superior nutrient availability.here ’ s another reason to stick to a vitamix ( includes the fiber when juicing ) instead of a norwalk juicer – http : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2010 / 09 / 14 / why-do-heavy-drinkers-outlive-nondrinkers.aspx it appears that juice , when separated from it ’ s fiber , within about a half hour , has free methanol in it – and a small amount of that converts inside of you into formaldehyde – which is used for embalming – and you definitely don ’ t want that in your body . this is apparently why folks who drink lots of alcohol live longer too ( read article for explanation ) .seems like a vitamix is a good solution.nice video , informative.howdy doc ! does this apply to juicing leafies ( greens ) , veggies ( celery , beet ) ? please respond.thanks in advance , ronsorry but that is nonsense , ask jay kordich “ the juiceman ” who is doing great at 90yo on raw and juicing . i am in my 70 ’ s and juice veggies every day . for some reason smoothies are hard for me to digest , not sure why.i am a juicing and green smoothie junkie ! i have a breville elite juicer and a vitamix blender . in order not to waste the ffiber from juicing i make veggie brownies ! ! so there is still hope to keep your fiber and all the good stuff that comes along with it ! ! ! ! ian : re : veggie fiber brownies : very creative . good for you.there are a lot of recipes on-line . i just use about 90 % pulp , two cups of juice from the juicing . oats , raisins , walnuts , cinnamon , ginger , honey , banana , cut apples and i press them firmly into a coconut greased pan and cook at 375 until the top is dry to the touch ! ! simply and filling ! they are good in the fridge for about 6 days.ian : that ’ s very cool . thanks for sharing some of the details . who knew brownies could be so healthy ? once again , a video that provides me with information i didn ’ t know . thank you ! after reading some of the comments and criticisms below i would like to add that it seems helpful to be striving for the high bar of nutrition . whole food > non-sugary smoothies > juice ; okay , good to know ! but for someone eating the typical standard american diet , adding a fresh green juice to their daily diet is probably really helpful . it seems like juice has a very high ratio of nutrition to calories . and sometimes doing an all juice diet for a few days helps me kick some food addictions and get back on track.so i ’ m not ready to dismiss freshly made juice as viable part of a healthy diet or its role in improving the health of society . it just may not be a part of the healthiest possible diet.maybe plastic is an even better fiber substitute than suggested by the 1988 study , as it also contains a lot of phenols bound to the plastic particles , e.g. bisphenol a. ; - ) question : how do they supply the juices and pomace for the studies ? is it made on the time they drink it or chilled for later ? or is it packages / bottles of juice like the ones we find in the supermarket ? and if they made it with a juice machine , was it the centrifuge or the grind and squeeze method ? i tried to ope the full study , beyond the abstract , but couldn ’ t find how . great info ! ! keep them coming , dr. greger ! ! thousand thank yous ! : ) hey fellows ! why don ’ t we crowd-translate these videos into other languages and make nutritionfacts a worldaround reference ? they are transcribed as they come out , which makes it really easy for anyone who wishes to put it into another language.rodrigo : having these videos in other languages is a fantastic idea . i believe nutritionfacts already has a system in place for doing translations . if anyone is interested in being a translator for videos , i believe that the process is to post your interest in a comment under a video . the nutritionfacts staff should see it and get in touch with you to tell you how it is done.would you like me to pass on your name as someone who wants to help translate – to make sure the staff see your interest ? or was there a particular 3rd part website / program that means “ crowd-translate ” you were suggesting get used ? hi thea ! thank you for the update . i already do translations , some of nutritionfacts , between other subjects . the nutritionfacts translations i do i send them by email or comment with the link to the translation . would be motivating to have more people doing it in other languages too . i use amara.org as video translation platform.now i understand.thanks for your original post . i hope it inspires people to help out.also , thanks for your work ! i think all of the volunteers really make a difference for this site.hey rodrigo ! we have an active team of translators working to do just that ! feel free to email me at tommasina @ nutritionfacts.org and i ’ ll give you more info . thanks for your enthusiasm ! : ) hi ! i sent an email already , as i would like to help on translations more closely . procedures , guidelines ? can you update me on how you collaborate on translations ? maybe i could keep a portuguese channel for nutritionfacts.org videos ? thanks for all you do too . thank you thea also.i think that demonizing all juice / juicing is over simplifying the issue and throwing the baby out with the bath water . the sugar water juice you find in bottles on store shelves that has been filtered , heat pasteurized and has added sugar and other preservatives is not the same as fresh cloudy extracted juice made at home with a juicer . when i make fresh pomegranate / apple juice at home it is this amazing purple cloudy thick drink teaming with nutrition and live enzymes … now compare that to the clear sugar water pom juice you find on shelves , not at all the same product . i bought my first juicer from watching jay ‘ the juiceman ’ kortich who is still alive and doing great today at over 90 . he went 2 years living on juice alone . i juice fruits and veg a few times a week and it has only given me great health.i think this video is well done and extremely helpful . so many people , myself included before now ! , think that juicing “ just removes the fiber ” . the understanding was : while fiber is important , you could get all the other benefits of the food ( except the fiber ) by juicing . and so , why not juice when you want / need a whole bunch of nutrients ? that fiber just takes up so much space in the tummy . … well , now we know one science-based answer to this question : polyphenol phytonutrients.i understand that lots of people love their juicing and that in some cases , juicing may even make some sense . but this video provides some great information that everyone should keep in mind when making decisions like : should i buy a juicer or blender ( since i can only afford one , only want one , or only have a place for one ) ? note that in addition to making fiber-rich smoothies , a blender has lots of other practical uses . a blender is not a single purpose appliance , like i think a juicer.re : the conversation here : i appreciate reading people ’ s take on juicing at home vs store-bought as well as their personal reasons for juicing . those contributions are an important part of the conversation and help expand the story / issue for people who come to this site . however , those opinions do not mean that there is anything wrong with this video . the video provides helpful information on one aspect of the issue – which is pretty much what all of dr. greger ’ s videos do . nutritionfacts uses a format that i personally find helpful . by getting details on one aspect of nutrition at a time , i am able to absorb the information – and over time , i build up a very nice big-picture . i am just careful to always keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of the format used on this site . a format that works well for many people , not just me . ( thank you dr. greger . ) if you eat apples , your cholesterol drops , compared to drinking apple juice , but leave just a little of the fiber behind — cloudy apple juice — and it makes a difference.most seem to ignore this sentence from the transcript.jean : you may be right . i don ’ t know . what i do know and fully sympathize with is : there is often a lot of information packed into one of dr. greger ’ s videos . it is easy to miss some of the details . i know i often find it helpful to review a video multiple times – or to watch the video and then read the transcript later.have a good weekend.how about the video on this site that mentioned a study where participants took 3-5 shots of kale juice a day and saw significant improvements in their cholesterol levels ? surely this wasn ’ t due to fiber , therefore there has to be some positive nutrient benefits from juicing . those in the study most likely wouldn ’ t have consumed that much raw kale ( 30 lbs in a few months ) on their own . to me , this means juicing is a good alternative if you don ’ t have the time / appetite to consume that much roughage , not to mention what it could do to your digestive system.what is the orac ( anti-oxidant ) potential with fiber rich , live culture ferments . an example such as home-made sourkrout . should a fiber be included into soy yogurt ? of coarse i ’ ve heard of “ natto ” , a fermented soy bean . tempeh is a ferment i believe … has fiber.are all juices “ equal ” ? is there any study about fresh juices made with slow juicing machines like tribest slowstar or omega juicers ? hola , disculpe pero mi ingles es pésimo asi que , a favor de la interculturalidad , emito mi comentario en lengua nativa.dr , el jugo al parecer , segun su video , genera perdidas importantes en el valor nutricional de las frutas , pero que hay del uso de una batidora o una minipimer en vez de un “ saca jugos ” clásico ? muchas gracias por sus interesantes videos y recomendaciones . desde ya difundiendo estos interesantes datos en chileguessing the juice they referred to was the crap sold from stores , which is sugar laden concentrate and not from using a real juicer … too often specifics like this are not defined in studies referred to-way too often.what about home made juice made with a masticating juicer ? my juicer brand is kuvings . thanks.great presentation on the comparison between the whole fruit and fruit juices . i suspect that the fruit juices were pasteurized . this is very different than raw juices extracted from fresh fruit . i think that there are some key differences here . for example , diabetics respond more positively to raw juices than pasteurized fruit juices.did the juicing research cover freshly juiced fruit and veggies or was this pasteurized processed factory made juices ? i use a champion juicer and while it removes the majority of the fiber there is way more left than when you drink a store bought juice . just wondering . thank you.did i just answer my own question about blending fruits for smoothies ? are they equal to the whole fruit being eaten ? i ’ ve said “ yes ” , because i like smoothies . but , in answering a question yesterday , i said that mashed potatoes have a higher glycemic index than whole potatoes , that ’ s because the starch molecules have been broken apart in the mashing , etc . so , thinking about smoothies , is it analogous ? only not the starch molecules , but the fiber . so , in searching , i found this : ” factors that raise the gi of foods processing : the gi ’ s of carbohydrates can rise due to the processing of certain foods . any carbohydrates that are puffed , made instant , or gelatinized , will have a much higher gi than if they weren ’ t processed . an example is a rice cake . that has a glycemic index almost as high as glucose , about as high of a gi as you can get ! can you believe that , and for all this time people have been swallowing bags of rice cakes not knowing they are recognized by the body as worse than table sugar . ” from bodybuilding.com.just a thought . we are protected from the fructose in fruit by the “ packaging ” , i.e. fiber . have we just destroyed the packaging by smashing up the fiber ? can someone help . is this just “ overthinking ” the issue ? aint ’ it fun ? some of us have imperfect dentition and can ’ t easily chew certain whole foods . such as apple skins just ball up in my mouth and frozen blueberry skins go down in chunks . so my way of getting the benefit is to puree apples and frozen blueberries together ( i make it thick and slightly chunky ) and enjoy it on my whole grain cereal . some of us have to pick what is the best way for us to ingest the fruits and veges we need to have healthier bodies . may not be ideal but is best for us.this video validates that those slow masticating juicers are overrated and overpriced . i use a kuvings centrifugal juicer + a blender . juice the hard fruits / veggies like apples , carrots , celery , beets , cucumbers , etc and then blend leafy greens with it . i used a slow juicer for 3 + years and it was a chore.does that also include the juice you make at home ? or store bought juice ? when you # juice you can use the pulp in your # smoothie and add at the end the juice ( to prevent the oxidation when it ’ s blended ) i also add at the last 10 seconds a blend of 27 organic superfoods and the best organic brown rice protein.wow. this topic – blending whole vs. extracting “ juice ” has really hit a nerve in us . i tried to introduce in the beginning of this conversation , several points which have been picked up by too few people , and interestingly , the ones who did notice what i had to contribute are cancer self-treatment and / or older americans . first , the main question is whether one is actively treating cancer ( s ) . this one fact requires special consideration , and based on the widely reported actual “ results ” of millions of people ( not just the few who entered this conversation here ) , this is what makes dr. g ’ s video so provocative . “ active cancer ” happening means that unless and until one actively faces this fact and the question of what is my plan to address it ? , this choice of blenderizing vs. extracting “ juice ” from the highest value fruits and vegetables ( darkest & brightest colored ones ) is really not the right question and can easily become just another stalling tactic ( intellectualizating adinfinitum , seeking silver bullet answers , wanting others to tell us what to do , etc . ) . the correct question is : how can we get more of the darkest / brightest produce items down our throats every day until i can produce evidence this is turning around for me ? here is where i am coming from : as per an international study several years ago , americans are the lowest consuming vegetable eaters out of 32 nations , and spend less time in their kitchens interacting with produce than anyone ( including the economically disadvantages countries who eat to live and the economically advantaged ones with every facilitative kitchen convenience . so , the goal is to figure out how you can break away from the pack – how to actually change lifelong habits which are continually conditioned into us every hour . everyone has realistic psychological , financial , social , and time constraints . so , if by using a whole food blender approach , and limiting yourself to consuming 10 % of the darkest / brightest produce that one could potentially consume by using an extractive “ juicer ” machine ( 10xs the total produce consumption is an estimate – depends upon what / how much ) , then this would be a killer change goal for your daily life , wouldn ’ t it ? the point is , anything we do along this line will be a step in the right direction because we have no where to go but up ( # 32 compared to 32 nations studied ) . somewhere along the way in this long string of comments , nearly everyone missed the main point which is that getting much more of these phytochemicals into our bodies is the only answer . my point has been all along , that dr. g ’ s video missed this small but important detail re : active cancer vs. wanting to improve one ’ s chances of not getting cancer , increasing our anti-inflammatory eating , and stepping up our game in just getting more produce into our diets . i just hope people remember this point when they or someone they know gets cancer , because the # 1 way to beat it will be to saturate your cells with the brightest / darkest colored produce in every way you can : eating them whole , juicing them ( norwalk , etc . ) , blenderizing them ( vitamix ) soups / smoothies / sprouts , encapsualizing them in the form of powders , and if you have the money : buying known formulas based on concentrated versions of these same phytochemicals which are available everywhere now and which you will be buying at “ super-retail ” prices if you take off a month at an alternative cancer treatment center in arizona or mexico . one last point : when one destroys the cell wall of a plant it instantly initiates what is essentially a rotting process . think of it – when you smash a leaf it rots first in the bag inside the refrig , right ? rotting is progressive and involves more than just loss of nutrients – includes invitation for pathogenic reproduction and harmful byproducts for someone with active cancer and / or trying to avoid cancer – not a good thing . raw juicing , and raw blenderized drinks really need to be used at that time ( not stored , frozen , etc . ) . the other thing is the known fact of raw produce carrying ample pathogens even if washed , peeled – carrot skins are famous as are around the core area of any piece of produce but all produce exterior is rampant with many pathogens . this small but significant issue can be extremely important to an active cancer person using raw produce in any way because you will soon find out in your cancer self-treatment , that you have numerous other abnormal , harmful symbiotic infections and your body is tired of fending them off – cancer is the end of a long line of break-downs . as a recently retired sustainable csa farmer , i can tell you it is impossible to avoid introducing various viruses , molds , bacteria , etc . , into one ’ s body even if you pick it and walk in and juice it . active cancer people already know they have co-existing harmful infections … .already know their enzymes are out of wack or missing , and therefore , it is essential when consuming raw produce , to simultaneously increase the broadest spectrum of probiotics while we are rearranging our soldiers to favor the good guys . i have know many people who failed to add raw garlic to their juice or buy probiotics or get into kimche , etc . , and could never get ahead of their dysbiosis no matter how much of the beautiful bright / dark produce they consumed every day.the subject of juicing reminds me of a similar question , that of drying and pulverizing berries and other foods . some of the foods i eat in powder form are amla , acai , and reishi mushrooms . are you still getting a benefit from powdered berries ? does a teaspoon of amla powder count as a serving of fruit ? good info . thank you dr. ! i have been told that the high powered blenders “ smash the cell walls ” and release all the nutrients.vegetable juice ( not fruit ) , smoothies and whole raw seems like the way to go.removing fiber has some good points .. i can make pure ice cubes of kale juice ( high speed blender / nut milk bag stainer ) and get a lot of nutrients with every meal .. eating an equivalent amount of raw kale would not be easy.sara , you need to re-read that paper as you have misrepresented the findings in there . in fact that paper has nothing to do with the current debate . the fact that people use blenders and juicers is a testament to their lack of understanding of the role that whole and real foods play in optimal nutrition.for those of you hanging your hat on your beliefs you should watch steven hawking ’ s bbc program on the universe . you can believe whatever you want and new scientists discover or come up with new theories all the time so i wouldn ’ t hold on too tight as we are in the age of discovery and what is true today may not be tomorrow . i prefer to wade through the advertising and objectively look at the material being presented.just as a quick addition to the video , a scientific study was done on the antioxidant levels of all the so-called super juices being sold and as i have suspected , none of them held up . in fact , grape juice from the supermarket came up on top and that is not a very good recommendation as it is still a very poor choice.i agree that whole fruit is best , and that juice which is produced within industry is not very good , but what about juicing whole fruits and vegetables , i ’ ve started juicing using a masticating juicer , but i keep getting conflicting information. so i juice my vegetables and fruit and make about 3 liters of juice in one go which lasts me about 3 / 4 days , i am not sure if its a placebo effect , but i feel more energized and have better workouts at the gym. however , speaking with friends who are super intelligent and graduates from cambridge colleges say that the nutrients once masticated are of no value and that after the juice has been oxidised no minerals left worth the effort . has any research been done on the subject of juicing as home ? what are your views of the subject of fresh masticating juicing at home ? is there any benefit ? if you want a lot of fruit the blender is generally best . if you want a lot of vegetables the juicer is probably best . a lot of people use both. apple juice , apples , asparagus , bananas , bile acids , blueberries , bone health , bone mineral density , bowel movements , butyrate , calcium , carob , cholesterol , colon health , diabetes , diarrhea , fiber , fruit , fruit juice , grapes , gut flora , juice , laxatives , metamucil , onions , phytonutrients , polyphenols , smoothies , stool size , vegetables the majority of polyphenol phytonutrients may be bound to fiber , helping to explain the marked difference in health impacts between whole fruit and fruit juice . for those that like drinking their fruits and vegetables , this suggests smoothies are preferable . i can imagine people who eat really healthy thinking they get so much fiber from their regular diet that they need not concern themselves with the loss from juicing , but they may be losing more than they think.why are polyphenol phytonutrients important ? see , for example , my video how to slow brain aging by two yearsnot that fiber isn ’ t important in its own right . check out :
PLAIN-2539	cooked beans or sprouted beans ? beans , chickpeas , split peas , and lentils are packed with nutrients and play a role in the prevention of chronic disease , but most can ’ t be eaten raw . boiling is the most common cooking method , which is what ’ s used to make canned beans , but sprouting is becoming more popular . which is healthier ? there hadn ’ t been a head-to-head comparisons , until now.the easiest way to compare is to just measure the quantity of the polyphenol phytonutrients thought to account for some of their protective benefits against chronic disease , for example the anthocyanin pigments that make these particular beans so pretty.as you can see , sprouted beans have more of some , but less than others , in fact you see that across the board with the other phenolic phytonutrients . more of some ; less of others . because the positive effects of these compounds may be related to their antioxidant capacity , you can compare the overall antioxidant power of boiled versus sprouted beans , for which boiled appears to have a marginal edge , but ideally we ’ d actually measure physiological effects , like what about boiled versus sprouted against cancer cells . and that ’ s just what they did.this is the concentration of raw bean extract needed to cut the breast cancer growth rate in half in a petri dish . boiled beans do about 40 times better . same cancer growth inhibition at just a fraction of the concentration , and sprouted beans do about the same.now you can ’ t even eat most beans raw , but i wanted to include them just to show you a fascinating phenomenon . no amount of raw bean extract appears able to totally stop the growth of breast cancer cells , but just small amounts of cooked or sprouted beans can . and same thing with actually killing off cancer . no amount of raw bean extract works , but both boiled and sprouted beans can.similar results were found for melanoma , processing the beans — either cooking or sprouting boosted anticancer activity in vitro , but against kidney cancer , raw and boiled worked , but sprouted didn ’ t at all.the researchers were also interested in brain protection . given that elderly persons reporting always eating legumes may be significantly less likely to experience cognitive decline , the researchers decided to compare the protective effects of boiled versus sprouted beans on astrocytes.astrocytes are the most abundant type of cell in our brain . they are star-shaped cells that keep our brain running smoothly . should they become damaged , though , they may an important role in the development in neurodegenerative disorders such as lou gehrig ’ s disease , alzheimer ’ s , or parkinson ’ s . so if we ’ re thinking clearly , we should thank our lucky stars.to see if beans would help protect astrocytes from damage , first they had to make sure bean extracts wouldn ’ t cause any damage . this is the before , dripping nothing on astrocytes in a petri dish , 100 % viability . and this is the after , adding boiled bean extract . didn ’ t hurt the cells at all . and sprouted beans seem to even help them grow a little bit . same thing but this time we ’ re going to damage the astrocytes with an oxidative chemical that killed off about a quarter of the cells . but with some boiled bean extract on board the astrocytes were protected at the two higher doses , but the sprouted beans didn ’ t appear to offer significant benefit.so what ’ s the takeaway ? as far as i ’ m concerned , we should eat beans in whichever way will get us to eat the most of them.i do love my lentil sprouts , one of the healthiest snacks on the planet ( along with kale chips ) . it ’ s amazing that i can create fresh produce in 2 to 3 days on my kitchen counter . sprouting ’ s like gardening on steroids ! but using canned beans i can get similar nutrition in about 2 to 3 seconds . in the paleo diet world , there ’ s a new craze for consuming “ resistant starch ” for it ’ s positive health effects on the large intestine , where rs enables increased butyrate production . ( supposedly , the later helps to “ keep the gut wall healthy and sealed . ” and “ benefits the body by controlling inflammation … ” … beans are a top source of rs they claim , yet as low-carb dieters , they prefer to avoid natural sources and supplement with potato starch . is increased butyrate production useful ? can we produce enough via whole foods ? does potato starch offer any real benefits as they claim ? yeah i ’ d like to hear some actual science on this from dr. g as well . my suspicion is that as per usual the paleo people are full of it , especially since whole white potatoes are so bad for you , and i can ’ t imagine an extract from a food like that being good for you where the whole food is bad for you . but , like i say i ’ d love to hear the actual science on it . who knows , maybe it ’ s a blind squirrels stumbling upon nuts situation.the issue of potatoes being bad for you is a different issue , and a very important one … it ’ s hard for me to accept that one doctor like dr mcdougall can endorse potatoes as maybe one of the healthiest foods on the planet while dr greger gives them a red light . how can two people who are so close on the big picture have opposed viewpoints on something as basic as the health value of eating potatoes ? it ’ s very confusing … potatoes , tomatoes , goji berries , eggplant , certain peppers are “ nightshades ” . very harmful to some people . my arthritic conditions virtually eliminated after removing nightshades , as well as neurological issues . life changing to say the least . i ’ m guessing you already know about nightshades.how does a person discover if he / she should avoid the nightshades ? one vietnamese grandmother warned against eating any eggplant because of her experienced observations with what she ate and joint pain and vitality.well , i have to admit that i hadn ’ t heard of dr. mcdougall before reading your comment , so i don ’ t know a whole lot about him . one thing i have gleaned from browsing his website is that he doesn ’ t seem to include the research that he bases his claims on , which is something that dr. greger does for each of his videos . that does lower my confidence in dr. m ’ s opinions , even if only slightly . to get an admittedly rough sense of where dr. m is coming from , i watched his video “ in defense of the potato , ” and to be honest i wasn ’ t all that impressed . in that video , he speaks in very broad terms , and i didn ’ t hear anything approaching the specificity that you get from dr. g. dr. m talked about how “ ancient civilizations ” thrived on potatoes , how ireland did well with the potato , and things like that , but he didn ’ t really dive into any concrete science that i could hear . of course , there ’ s many reasons why he might have chosen such a strategy , but all i really got from the video is , “ trust me ; i ’ m a doctor . ” dr. g , on the other hand , goes to great lengths to explain the science in as easily digestible a format as possible , and i can ’ t recall a single time when he ’ s used an argument from authority ( “ i ’ m right because i ’ m a doctor ” ) to justify a claim he ’ s made . i guess the final difference that occurs to me between the two doctors is that dr. m seems to advocate a specific formulation of a plant-based diet , i.e. , one that ’ s high in starches . dr. g , on the other hand , doesn ’ t seem to make recommendations that are nearly that specific , and from what i ’ ve read that ’ s the more scientifically justified position . a ( mostly ) whole foods , plant-based diet would probably help everyone get healthier , but beyond that we either have little firm information on the ideal diet , or possibly there is simply no one-size-fits-all diet plan that a doctor is justified in recommending . so by that measure , i put my money on dr. g. anyway , i hope it doesn ’ t seem like i ’ m trolling you or anything . i ’ m just another english major who is really wishing i studied more science in college so that i could rely less on the advice of doctors , even great doctors , and read the primary source material myself . hope my perspective on things is at least a little helpful … mcdougall actually works with patients to reverse their health problems . i ’ m sure he studies the science as well . but he ’ s going from his direct experience with what works . technically , this can be viewed as a form of science just as respectable and useful as academic “ studies ” .technically ? no , with all due respect , not always . the whole reason that scientific studies are organized to contain things like control groups , placebos , randomized assignment to either group and conditions that create ‘ double blinds ’ ( where neither the patient or the experimenter know who is getting the placebo vs the substance being tested ) is in order to counteract precisely the types of unrepeatable biases that can occur in situations ( like those you are describing with dr. mcdougall ) where one doctor / healer / authority / person who truly believes in his / her “ medicine ” administers it to people who believe in him / her.i ’ m not saying dr. mcdougall is incorrect ( i know nothing about him particularly other than what you ’ ve stated ) , i ’ m just saying he should state his sources or have his findings submitted to the same rigorous standards as needed for publication in the top scientific journals , then publish them for the scientific community to scrutinize and attempt to replicate . that ’ s how science works . it is not built on the anecdotal experiences of any one or even 13 physicians.maybe research which we find reported in those professional journals originates from hypothesis derived from direct experiences , that is , in the context where dr mcdougall works , trying things to cure patients , finding some things actually work . that too is how science works.dr. g could say : i ’ m right despite i ’ m a doctor ! dr john mcdougall is one of the most vocal long-term advocates of whole foods plant based diet . he ’ s been on board for most of his career and long-term relationships with ornish , campbell , esselstyne , barnard , etc . he ’ s a working doctor but he ’ s best known for his diet strategy books , seminars and spa events designed for people who want to turn their bad habits into good . yes , he does have a thing for “ starch ” but this is a minor variation singing from the identical song sheet as the others . his newsletters and depth of experience available through online publications demonstrate he ’ s on very solid ground . as for potatoes : they are a fine component of any diet , versatile to cook and prepare , easy to store . he is talking about whole food potatoes ( not chips or powdered versions or supplement capsules ) . there are vitamins and minerals , some fibre , a little sugar , no fat . he recommends cooking them without oil . they are also happily filling which helps limits the ingestion of too many calories in general.well said sir ! agree . though mcdougall and many others laud potatoes , dr greger cites in a video with a title on toxins in potatoes that they are bad for us , and this evaluation is based on his reading of a review article of studies on potatoes . it ’ s one of the few issues where i really don ’ t know what to think . though someone here claims that the toxins in potatoes are something the human body can deal with well enough.but it is the white russet potatoes . the other potatoes are fine . there is also a video that shows russets to give us a 50 % increased risk of cancer . but compare that to animal foods that give us a 400 % increase in the risk of cancer . just make sure to eat yellow / gold , red , purple potatoes . and , of course , you should never eat the skin of russets , that ’ s where the toxins are , but on the other potatoes it is advisable to eat the skin because most of the nutrition is there.i read / watch follow a lot from dr. g , mcdougal , dr. ornish , dr. esselstyn , dr. campbell and dr. barnard . campbell ’ s books ( whole and china study ) were very interesting , but a lot of work to get through . anyhoo … in general i don ’ t find too much conflicting views or recommendations . there are some , and some people will make a bigger deal than necessary over these slight differences . in general they are all pointing everyone in the same direction , none of them appear ( to me ) to have seriously conflicting recommendations . it can get ridiculous very quickly though . i ’ ve seen reader ’ s debate and get worried about the pro / cons of the actual size of the potato they are eating ! if you are now worried about red versus green kale … you are doing just fine.i had one of my work colleagues ask me what i was eating for breakfast the other day . he started telling me that he read a study that quick oats are better for you than whole ( slow ) oats . i just smiled and said … hey at least we aren ’ t debating between bacon and eggs with gravy ! i did follow that i don ’ t let information without peer and adversary reviewed scientific study keep me up at night though . ; ) well said , well said : ) i totally agree … i bought john mcdougall ’ s first book “ the mcdougall plan ” in 1983 to give me more balance as an ovo lacto vegetarian . and it was a bit of a bible for years.however , i am now a health professional myself , and i can see the cracks in dr mc ’ s presentations. i.e. he teaches that one can overfeed on carbohydrates and not gain significant bodyfat . why ? because according to his reading and interpretation of the literature , de novo lipogenesis ( making of new fat from carbs ) is a very inefficient chemical pathway and not used by the body significantly . this is one of his major foundations to do a high carb diet for weight loss.i ’ ve read john ’ s articles and listened to most of his videos on this topic. i have also read the literature broadly on the topic , and believe my understanding of it is better than most.what i can say is john only includes references for his articles that support his view on dnl . he has never cited or commented on the majority of articles that show dnl is a significant path in converting excessive carbohydrates into fat , nor the fact that most people who overfeed on high carb diets gain weight similar to eating any other type of diet.it was sad for me to discover this about dr mc . i think he is a genuinely good guy , but feel age and zeal is compromising his rationality . further , i note in one of his articles that he says he has always been an enthusiastic and hyperactive personality . his grandmother always used to tell him he ’ d be better calming himself regularly . he doesn ’ t agree . for me , this is probably his downfall . i ’ ve seen signs of an uncontrolled energy , a hypomania even , in him . and this tendency is not helpful in the objective pursuit of the truth via the scientific method.therefore , i warn all to put more faith in the scientific consensus , and less in any one doctor or scientist . the consensus is designed to protect the quest for truth , from the lack of objectivity of any one man.love that last paragraph . too true ! dr. mcdougall offers extensive references in his newsletter pieces ” > , and t. colin campbell was certainly impressed with mcdougall ’ s depth of knowledge and file cabinets full of research studies in the china study.as far as i can tell , the only major point of contention between drs. greger and mcdougall is on fatty whole plant foods like nuts and avocados . mcdougall advises patients to avoid them , while dr. greger has highlighted out studies on their benefits . mcdougall ’ s position has its merits , as there are healthy traditional diets that include no fatty foods and no fatty food is completely free of problematic constituents like saturated fats . imo the best evidence at present is in favor of daily nuts & seeds , and their inclusion makes a whole plant based diet more palatable and likely to be adhered to , long term.nice summary ( though to be fair , dr mcdougall says to avoid or limit nuts to an once a day ) . i wonder though , what your opinion is on omega-3 ’ s . dr greger suggests a daily supplement of 250-500 mg , while dr mcdougall thinks all oils are essentially bad for our arteries and recommends no supplement . personally i split the difference . i take a weekly supplement but also try to get some flax into my diet daily . any thoughts ? flaxseeds have very little saturated fat . flax also has a very good omega 3 to 6 ratio , much better than even walnuts . almonds only have about 1 gram of saturated fat per ounce , compared to 2 for peanuts . sunflower seeds have less than 2 grams of saturated fat per ounce . if a person gets all their fat from nuts and seeds , while excluding coconut , which is the highest in saturated fat , one can still easily stay below 7 % of calories in saturated fat . i eat a lot of nuts , but i calculated that i am still below 7 % of calories from saturated fat . it could be valid to exclude nuts and seeds , but even then , there are good arguments to eat flaxseed , even if it is the only seed or nut one eats.your approach to this is very balanced , sensible and even methodical . don ’ t put yourself down , have confidence in your intelligence girl ! your perspective is very helpful.i think that dr. greger does not give white potatoes a red light , but i think that all things equal , he said sweet potatoes and the colored flesh variety appear a bit better.as long as you don ’ t cook them in oil , butter or cream and cheese.here dr greger red lights potatoes , mentioned that the natural toxins in them are bad for us , based on a major review of studies on potatoes , and says we can no longer ignore this , https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = ojt1jgipaaitoxins mostly in the skins ~ but only on the russets . you should always eat the skin on yellow / gold , red , and purple potatoes.really ? i find it weird … hmmm … . i don ’ t know what his comment “ we already knew they weren ’ t good ” means . but , i generally get organic , and might consider peeling them more . but given the alternatives , i ’ ll stick to potatoes.from an older video white potatoes were associated with a 50 % increased risk in kidney cancer . here is the video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-white-bread-good-for-you / that ’ s why i stick with the gold , red , purple potatoes now.i may cut back on russets , tho.yeah , that ’ s what i did . eliminate the russets and eat all of the others which are very healthy . skins should always be eaten.interesting , after going raw ( have been vegan for 3 years now , raw for 1 year ) and ditching salt , potatoes are one thing i have found to have a bad taste . i still eat cooked lentils , cabbage , corn sometimes , but i have totally disliked potatoes . this explains it ! hippocrates health institute or the real truth about health.comdr greger ’ s video on white potatoes suggests they are toxic and this issue needs further study . that video doesn ’ t really say anything worth listening to in my opinion . don ’ t many plants have their own bug killer ? exactly , there is another study out there in italy i think that found no association . i will be very surprised if a staple food like white potatoes turns out to be truly unhealthy but it is fair what dr gregor reports , it is not his opinion but the finding of some of the research out there . we await further studies i guess.why shouldn ’ t the red light and his “ bad ” declaration be interpreted as a firm recommendation to not eat potatoes ? that ’ s how i take it . though i know that dr greger says that he doens ’ t recommend anything but just reports on the science.tobias you are not talking about purple potatoes right ? ( all of the colored potatoes ) dr greger actually recommends those . just clearing this up.right. i ’ m talking about the white potato that ’ s so popular ( minus the butter etc ) .tobias : re : “ … he doesn ’ t recommend anything … ” not to dispute your main point : i want to let you know that dr. greger does have a page of general nutrition recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / just in case you didn ’ t know that already , i thought you would be interested.thanks. yes , i follow this list closely . what i mean is that at some point dr greger says that he doesn ’ t advise participants on anything , eating this or that food , that he is simply reporting what the science tells us . i mostly accept this however i seem to hear direct advice coming through occasionally , as with potatoes . he takes a strong stance there , no ? tobias : yes . : - ) err , i mean , “ agree ” .don ’ t eat green or sprouting potatoes . the only pubmed articles i could access talked about using rats with unhealthy digestive systems . some people should limit or eliminate their nightshade consumption . there is a lot of information and misinformation on the web about this subject . and if you just send $ to some of these people they will send you a test kit and if needed the proper treatment for solanine poisoning.there ’ s a large body of evidence in favor of resistant starch , and the short chain fatty acids produced by gut bacteria from it . resistant starch and scfas appears to help prevent colon cancer , reduce the glycemic index of meals , displace pathogenic gut bacteria , reduce gallstone formation , and enhance absorption of some minerals , dr. greger has covered the topic in this video , and a recent scholarly reviews for those seeking more depth is : resistant starch as functional ingredient : a review ( 2010 ) .raw potato , high-amalose corn , cassava , and green banana flour starches are exceptional sources , but for those who prefer food , roasted and cooled potatos , yams , cassava , asian glass ( mung bean ) noodles , pearl barley and cooked beans of all sorts are also good . many cooked starches will gelatinize and become resistant if allowed to cool slowly ( eg , potato salad in the refrigerator ) .as is common , the paleo advocates are half right . they ’ ve come around to tubers being a part of our ancestral diet , but the influence of loren cordain ’ s early work has prevented them from embracing legumes , which have been part of hominin diets since the time of neanderthals.the paleo gurus recommend 4 tablespoons per day of potato starch , worked up to over a period of four days . does this sound like a very bad idea ? seems harmless enough , but it may not offer much benefit to those already consuming whole food plant based diets.remember , paleo advocates are denying themselves most whole food sources of resistant starch , so this supplementation of a dietary deficiency may be analogous to vegan supplementation of b12 . though there are no studies of resistant starch intake in whole plant diets , in general vegans already have markedly different gut microbiota from the general population , probably reflecting higher intake of resistant starch , fiber , and prebiotics like inulin and oligofructans , and lower intakes of compounds that preferentially feed the less desirable gut bacteria.is that paleo recommendation for raw potato starch ? in the article “ resistant starch as functional ingredient : a review , ” the author says that unripe , uncooked banana is high in resistant starch but not cooked banana . on the other hand , he says that cooked legumes retain their rs . he ’ s not clear about potatoes and grains . daryll , could you clarify whether cooked grains and cooked potatoes are high in resistant starch ? are cooked banana , grains and potatoes all subject to retrogradation once they ’ re refrigerated ? and do you know if the fermentable fiber is higher in cooked beans than in the raw bean sprouts ? hmph … not sure what to say . which “ paleo gurus ” are your talking about ? certainly not gary taubes , loren cordain or william davis ? my approach and personal take after reading books ( mcdougal , ornish , esselstyn , campbell ) : 1 . if i hear or read something that makes me go “ hmmm ” i go look for the supportive data , peer reviewed by scientists and medical doctors . start with nih.gov2. if you have to “ start up ” or “ work up ” or measure and weigh things ( other than obvious like spices and things that need measuring ) than you are not getting it . that feels like we have to regularly thread a needle for some magic silver bullet.just eat for health . i don ’ t want to die early because of heart disease , cancer , diabetes . i ’ ll compare my bp or blood-work ( fasting or non-fasting ) to anyone . once you make it about quality of life , longevity , everything else falls into place . seems like everyone i “ meat ” that wants to debate low-carb or paleo have two things in common : a ) they want to eat meat and b ) they are concerned about body weight . i ’ ve heard the joke that low carb works perfect if your primary motive is to buy a smaller coffin.we human always want to avoid the hard choices don ’ t we ? btw – dr. g ’ s annual leading causes of death summaries … i think anyone that watches one of those in their entirety can ’ t be anything curious.http : / / www.jeffnovick.com / rd / q _ % 26 _ as / entries / 2013 / 8 / 21 _ the _ healthy _ eating _ placemat _ a _ visual _ guide _ to _ healthy _ eating _ files / healthy % 20eating % 20plate.jpgright. there are so many paleo gurus these days . my references are via the bulletproof diet guru , or someone linked to him . in this space , these guys present themselves as the bleeding edge advocates for potato starch.i ’ m learning a lot presently by recording everything i eat . i ’ m pretty sure this device will prove critically important in honing my diet so i can fall below 150 total cholesterol . it helped me see that i ’ ve been eating more carbs from sugar vs starches , which may have an impact on my triglycerides , so i ’ m adjusting … i ’ ll probably stop weighing at some point but i enjoy it now.record away ! that is awesome and can be very revealing for sure . keep bouncing around here ( nutritionfacts.org ) and there ( wfpb ) … you sound like you are playing in the right neighborhood for sure . my goal when starting was to get off all meds . bp meds were the last and my dr. ( who admitted she knew nothing about nutritional science ) made a $ 5 bet i would have to stay on bp meds forever , even if just a small dosage.when i say don ’ t measure or over-think , here is an example : i didn ’ t have much to cook last night ( oct 5 ) . i didn ’ t feel like giving much effort either . but i hit pause on the football game , through the following in a pot and ate a big bowl an hour later : 3 cans of no sodium black beans 1 can of sliced , stewed tomatoes 1 squirt of tomato paste concentrate 1 diced onion ( sauteed with a little water , no oil ) 5-8 cloves of garlic ( sauteed at the end of the onion saute ) 4-5 hands full of torn up green kale 1 large cubed russett potato ( variety of spices like : salt , black pepper , cumin , turmeric , more cumin , oregano , even more cumin , parsley , cayenne pepper and a little more cumin ) 1-2 cups of wateri ’ ll probably have that for lunch every day this week , it made a bunch.a paxon : that ’ s a great story about the bet between you and your doctor . did you doctor actually pay up ? yes she did ! but i don ’ t think she ’ ll stop pushing drugs over dietary changes , mainly because i don ’ t think she trusts most people to be compliant . sadly … it makes sense . to me it wasn ’ t about the money or inconvenience . $ 4 a month for bp meds , no biggie . but it was about the underlying cause , not the quick fix pill ( with side effects btw ) . if you eat healthy ( especially wfpb ) and move around some way every day , you shouldn ’ t have elevated bp or cholesterol . right ? i asked her if she would read a book like china study or fok if i gave her a copy . she said she simply does not have the time . she has tons and tons of patients , a business to run and a family . no wonder drug reps with their free breakfasts and lunches get their attention . i know my doc cares , but her life is a numbers game.apax : nice reply . : - ) i think you are perfectly right concerning you doctor ’ s situation . i think many doctors are in the same place . they aren ’ t bad people . they are just normal people in a bad set-up . it was nice and smart of you to offer fok or the china study . you did all that you could.your story gave me a fun idea . i ’ m thinking if she were just a bit more motivated , she could bet all her clients that they couldn ’ t get off of med _ _ _ _ . “ you can do it if you wanted to with just diet . i ’ ll tell you how . but i ’ m thinking you won ’ t do it . i ’ ll bet you $ 5 to prove me wrong . otherwise , if you just want to treat the symptoms , we ’ ll go that route . ” i wonder if that kind of approach would be fun motivation for some people and / or your doctor . or it might offend people . i like the idea myself.sounds tasty.i ’ m on the good path , only 20 points away from sub-150 total . ldl is at 99 so after almost 2 years , i ’ m elated ! regarding meds , my father has started to experience nerve issues on his statins ( he ’ s 85 ) . he went out for dinner last night with friends and their “ very smart ” daughter who works for a pharma company told him there ’ s a med for that now . hmm . i ’ ve been suggesting to get off the statins , etc and change the diet . this morning at the resto he took eggs , ham , tats cooked in oil etc . anyway . it goes to show how making a good salary can cloud your ability to give good health advice.did you find that your non complex sugars came from fruits or added sugars ? i am curiousit was a combination of both , however since my last lipid profile ( 14 month earlier , when triglycerides were considerably lower , 92 then vs 135 now ) , i had started using refined sugar for the first time once again , in the form of maple syrup … ( i ’ m a vermonter : ) i also at dates very liberally , as well as mango and other fruit , bananas etc . liberally . anyway . i set a goal , turn my pattern around over the past few weeks ( details posted below ) but my doctor says three months before another profile . – diet change goal – starch 158 grams historic average. keep above 200 . – sugar 230 grams historic average. keep below 150 – results from 9 / 23 to 10 / 2 dietary changes – starch at 230 ( was 160 ) , sugar at 140 ( was 230 ) – starch : 80 grams more – sugar : 90 grams less , tobias : i ’ m sorry to hear about your father . it is so hard when the people we love listen to bad information.on the upside , congratulations on your own success . that ’ s so cool ! ! ! thanks . ( what it actually comes down to for my father is that he depends on the person who prepares his food . if he were provided an ideal diet , he ’ d go for it because he likes plant-based . ) on a different subject , i ’ m focusing now on whether high consumption of fructose in the from of whole fruit has a significant negative impact on triglycerides and thus promotes heart disease . has dr g covered this topic or can you suggest any resources ? thanks.tobias : i can sympathize with your father . i have long said that when i win the lottery , the first thing i ’ m going to do is hire a personal chef . i know my diet would improve dramatically then.concerning information about linking whole fruit to triglycerides and thus perhaps heart disease – i don ’ t have any real info on that subject . i think it is an interesting question . anecdote wise , i started thinking about fruitarians as that would be a group that might provide some insight into the question . it ’ s not a natural diet , though , so i don ’ t know how helpful it would be to study them . that said , i ’ ve never heard of the fruitarians having heart disease problems . other health problems , * yes . * but not heart attacks i don ’ t think . ( note i haven ’ t actively researched it , so i can ’ t say they don ’ t have heart problems . i ’ m just sharing a thought . ) if you end up with some personal anecdotal info you are willing to share , i ’ m sure people will be interested . good luck ! i ’ m actively studying the issue , creating a list of “ be careful ” versus “ it ’ s not a problem at all ” resources . i recall dr greger saying eat as much fruit as you like . mcdougall warns against eating too much . anyway . i was convinced that i need to cut back on fruit to deal with my slight triglyceride issue ( which is still below 150 , which is quite good ) … to get my total cholesterol down . but there are plenty of raw foodist who can show outstanding profiles with low triglycerides . my expectation is that the key is likely your body weight . are you still storing some fat and maybe eating a bit too much for your middle bmi level … if so , triglycerides might still be higher … the other idea is that it simply takes a few years to fully settle down your numbers . anyway . i ’ m doing some tests of my own … will post if i ever conclude anything … any new thoughts on this , tobias ? not really but having re-watched parts of dr mcdougall ’ s interview with nathan pritikin , the later explained that it actually took 3-5 years for his cholesterol levels to base or hit their low point . i guess our body has stores that need to be used up over time once we change our diet . so , i focus on improving my diet a bit here and there and hope for the best . my doctor was very happy with my total level at 170 and i am quite close to my target of 150 , so i ’ m not super concerned about it.gee , i wish i had your foresight to make a bet ! when i was diagnosed with diabetes , and after doing some research about the drugs i had to take and so on , i decided the medications i had to add to the list i was already taking were about as bad ( if not worse ) than the disease . especially after quickly gaining 20lbs after starting them , something i could ill afford , seeing as how i was already morbidly obese ( great term eh ? ) and had been battling that my entire life ! at 55 y.o. , the weight and diabetes were not the only health issues , besides the obvious high markers for everything , i also had fibromyalgia , severe arthritis , ibs , chronic fatigue , and on and on . anyway , though she of course advocated losing weight , etc . , the handout of the standard ada diet sheet was less than helpful , so i did my own research , and questioned her about the idea of using dietary measures to replace the medications . her reply was if i lost weight my blood sugars would improve , but she had never seen diet replace the need for medications , though she had heard it was possible in rare cases . lol ! on my next appointment after starting on a low fat wpfd , i became one of those “ rare ” cases , and she did a triple take after looking at my bloodwork ! her jaw literally dropped as she scanned it again and again ! she turned to me and asked , “ what are you doing ? ” so i told her and she was blown away . again , she had heard about it , but never seen it in her practice ! what a sad , sad commentary ! if i made her a $ 5 bet i would get off of each of my meds i could have pocketed $ 70 ! another sad commentary ! ha , sad ( standard american diet ) indeed ! better yet , i should have bet $ 1 per pound lost and made over $ 150 ! oh well , the rewards i got were infinitely more rewarding anyway ! wpfd = whole plant food diet ? that ’ s amazing you took your health into your own hands and really turned your conditions around . glad to hear you ’ re body is so much more well now . much peace to you.apex look at that stew ! nice and healthy.it ’ s important not to reduce cholesterol as it is necessary to proper brain function and cardiovascular health . it has been given a bad rap by pharma primarily to boost profits of statin drugs and other toxic meds . the liver produces cholesterol and it is protective for the heart , in particular , and the brain . too little can be damaging to the heart and also cause or increase the risk of depression . cholesterol is not the bad guy and cholesterol-lowering drugs do not discriminate between hdl and ldl no matter what the marketing $ hills tell you . if the body is producing what would be considered by the medical cartel as ‘ too much ’ , then it ’ s the body ’ s signal that the liver is producing an excess of cholesterol in order to stem inflammation which is the common denominator in all disease.so do you plan to eat more eggs , fatty meat , and cow milk and reduce carbs ? it is important that you do not fall for the fad diet claims that circulate the internet . every cell in the human body has the capability to produce cholesterol . deficiency will never occur in a normal human unless they are born with a rare genetic condition . dietary cholesterol influences serum cholesterol depending on how high serum cholesterol already is. please see some of these videos on egg and cholesterol. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-cholesterol-size-matter / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-the-egg-board-designs-misleading-studies / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / who-says-eggs-arent-healthy-or-safe / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / eggs-and-arterial-function / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / debunking-egg-industry-myths / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / carnitine-choline-cancer-and-cholesterol-the-tmao-connection / a friend of mine naturally has total cholesterol below 100 and feels terrific after eating eggs.as for me , my genes cause me to have high cholesterol but i have dropped it from over 300 to under 200 by swapping out eggs , butter , meat , and coconut products for lots of legumes – beans , lentils , peas , tempeh . i hope to further improve my cholesterol by trying smart veganism , which means no fish or yogurt until my next lipid panel.i ’ ve heard anecdotally that cholesterol under 150 , although terrific for preventing heart disease , unfortunately is associated with increased incidence of suicide or violent behavior.the first book about health i read , transcend by ray kurzweil and terry grossman m.d. sets a target total cholesterol between 160-180 , but that includes an ldl of under 80 and an hdl above 60 … and triglycerides below 100.i can ’ t speak to the anecdotal evidence of your friend but in regards to low cholesterol and suicide . that is a myth . please see here. http : / / plantpositive.com / blog / 2012 / 3 / 27 / cholesterol-cancer-and-depression.htmlit ’ s reassuring to read that there is no concrete evidence for the claim that low cholesterol causes depression and suicide . i am deliberately trying to lower my cholesterol but have also been feeling mildly depressed recently . depression has been a recurrent problem for me since adolescence . by exercising regularly and learning more about how to eat properly , i have been managing it without prescription medication . i doubt my current malaise is due to eating copious amounts of beans instead of meat , eggs , and dairy – it is more likely due to enduring the daunting process of applying for grad schools . i do miss the concrete structure my life had while i was a college student.i should also add that total cholesterol below 100 is ridiculously low . there must be some genetically lowered cholesterol at play here.my last measurement was 2.6 mmol / l ( 100.5 mg / dl ) , vegan diet , moderate exercise , no medication , early 30s , bmi 23 . i can imagine it would be easy to tweak diet and exercise to get lower.total cholesterol below 150 is heart attack proof status . i am not saying that low is bad , i am just gawking at how low it is since he is supposedly eating eggs too.i just had a big bowl of cold potato salad . easy to make a nice mayanaise with tofu , dijon mustard , lemon juice , wine vinegar , and a little erthritol.talk to us about potatoes.does the resistant starch or other fermentable fiber concentrate in the potato skin ( as opposed to flesh ) ? the gl of a medium baked potato is 17 , according to nutritiondata.com. that seems pretty high . do gl figures take into account the blood sugar levelling effects that fermentable fibers , including resistant starch , produce ? darryl : that ’ s a really helpful post . but i have a question. re : “ many cooked starches will gelatinize and become resistant if allowed to cool slowly ( eg , potato salad in the refrigerator ) . ” what if you cook your potato , allow it to cool , and then heat the dish up later ? i prefer hot dishes to cold . as long as i let the potato cool at some point after cooking it , do i loose the benefits if i later re-heat the potato ? does the same apply to barley ? why did you specify pearl barley ? i have been trying to get the hulled barley , which i understand is less processed . wouldn ’ t that be just as good in terms of the resistant starch in pearl barley ? also , i love the glass noodles . i used to think they were nothing but junk food . i started allowing myself to buy them after i read an early post by you a couple months ago when you listed them as a good source of this type of starch . but do i have to eat those noodles cold ? i ’ m guessing these are stupid questions , but i just don ’ t understand the topic enough to be able to figure it out . thanks ! creating resistant starch is also known as retrogradation , a crystalization process , where the long strands of polysaccharides align , exclude water , and form hydrogen bonds . this prevents our digestive enzymes from cleaving the the strands into absorbable sugars , so the resistant starch passes on to colonic bacteria which can . not all starches undergo retrogradation easily ; amylose has a highly linear structure that aligns and compacts easily , while amylopectin is a highly branched molecule that doesn ’ t . a number of grains and tubers have been developed with higher amylose content to reduce their glycemic index , though i ’ ve not seen labelling of this in the market.reheating will add some thermal energy causing them to bounce about and some but not all of the resistant starch becomes digestable . this paper indicates that the percentage of starch from mashed potatoes that is resistant or only slowly digestable builds up during successive cycles of heating and cooling : freshly cooked 1 % cooled 10 % reheated x 1 , hot 5 % reheated × 1 , cold 17 % reheated x 2 , hot 9 % darryl : thanks for your reply ! ! that last part is super-fascinating and good news to me . i ’ m happy with getting 5 % or 9 % .interesting compendium … it seems that canned beans are much lower in rs than beans you cook yourself . wonder why ? canned beans are almost invariably pressure cooked , which leads to more damage to microscopic cell structures enclosing starch granules.butyrate ( by-product of resistant starch metabolism by gut bacteria ) does indeed promote healthy tight junctions and has anti-inflammatory effects.a fantastic website about resistant starch that was shared by the healthy librarian on facebook ( she ’ s a medical librarian and friend of the esselstyns ) : video on the butyrate basics : http : / / www.csiro.au / hungrymicrobiome / video.html more videos : http : / / www.csiro.au / hungrymicrobiome / howitworks.html foods highest in resistant starch : http : / / www.csiro.au / hungrymicrobiome / food.htmlfor most wfpb eaters i don ’ t think it ’ s anything that ’ s going to revolutionize their diet ; most of us already eat these types of foods , but it is nice to hear yet another mechanism by which they promote good health.as for the paleos … this reminds me of when i read about how some of them take ip-6 supplements , yet refuse to eat any phytate containing whole foods . on the one hand it ’ s cognitive dissonance at its best , and on the other , i guess i ’ m happy for their colons that at least they are supplementing . “ … happy for their colons … ” funny “ won ’ t somebody please think of the colons ? ? ! ? ” when i read about those paleo diets , i can ’ t help but be concerned ! considering we ’ re all just walking coral reefs with a brain , it ’ s sad to think how those paleo reefs really got the short end of the stick.p.s. i like your picture , aloti remember when i first caught wind of the paleo diet i was excited to think that someone finally had the common sense to try to replicate the way our progenitors ate as a healthy diet … it just made sense to me to nurture ourselves on the foods we evolved to eat . until i started reading the actual information , or rather , dis-information . i ’ m no scientist , but some of the concepts were just too contrived and dogmatic to feel even remotely natural or sensible in the context i had envisioned . i knew it would be popular because it caters to a lot of what the population wants to believe , but it seems contradictory to me . i have a hard time imagining cavemen walking around with little cruets of oil or bottles of supplements to sustain them while they are so busy slaughtering animals every day ! i know that northern european cavemen often went through the refinement process to produce potato starch to boost their butyrate production . many archaeological digs have found the potato mills and rinsing stations . paleo man was very resourceful . he would often make a bread of potato starch , almond meal and coconut flour.coconuts and almonds in northern europe ? exactly . ( hint : da st is being sarcastic ) .i don ’ t know , the whole idea of sprouting just seems too unsafe to me . from foodsafety.gov : “ unlike other fresh produce , seeds and beans need warm and humid conditions to sprout and grow . these conditions are also ideal for the growth of bacteria , including salmonella , listeria , and e. coli . ” another warning : “ since 1996 , there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with different types of raw and lightly cooked sprouts . most of these outbreaks were caused by salmonella and e. coli . ” the website does say that you can combat some of this risk by cooking your sprouts , but they still advise children and the elderly to avoid sprouts altogether . in my judgment , it ’ s not worth the risk – i ’ ll stick with my cooked beans.here ’ s the link to the article i quoted : http : / / www.foodsafety.gov / keep / types / fruits / sprouts.htmlthe contamination was from commercial operations . e-coli comes from animals . i sprout my own at home with clean hans and jars.from the website i cited : “ are homegrown sprouts safer ? not necessarily . if just a few harmful bacteria are present in or on the seed , the bacteria can grow to high levels during sprouting , even under sanitary conditions at home . ” there are people that grow seeds specifically for sprouting , which are in conditions engineered to prevent contamination that conventional seed might encounter.i play it safe and boil my sprouted beans . yesterday i cooked up about 5kilos of sprouted red kidney beans , chick peas , brown chick peas and black beans . i had sprouted the beans for two days . using a large stockpot ( 24quart , 22.7 litre ) i boiled some water , then put in the red kidney beans for 30 mins , then added the chick peas for a further 30 mins ( now an hour in total ) , then added the black beans for the final fifteen mins – so they whole cooking process took 1hr and 15mins . i left the lid on the saucepan over night and this morning i spent about half an hour transferring the beans into plastic ziploc bags ( i think they are bpa free ) , and put them straight into my chest freezer – they should last me about a month . i re-heat them by adding them to my other vegetables that i cook in my rice cooker for the final five minutes of the cooking process.is it harmful to the gut and other parts of the body to ingest grains that are raw and sprouted ? there are a lot of protein supplements and other products that contain raw sprouted barley and other grains , and i often wondered if humans can digest things such as raw sprouted barley . seems to me like they might harm the gut , but who knows . and , i have absorption problems so have had to supplement with these products.i too would like to know if eating raw barley ( sprouted , of course ) , is bad for us . is it even digestible ? any opinions on soaking beans , nuts / seeds , and whole grains such as rice and barley as opposed to sprouting ? i ’ ve read that there are similar benefits without some of the drawbacks associated with sprouting but am not sure about this.it would appear that beans are truly “ magical . ” how do i know ? i sang the song as a kid and didn ’ t really know how much truth i was singing . . . until now ! ; - ) the starch in the beans and lentils , as far as i know , is hard on the digestive system . i ’ d rather cook them . they still have amazing benefits . after all , generations before us cooked them , ate them regularly and those who did that were healthy . in my country , monks would eat cooked beans daily , they get sick of eating it that often , but they hardly have health issues.take care of your astrocytes – eat your beans … .what about bean flours ? is there still the same benefit if you cook or bake with them ? lwc , if the flour comes from the whole bean ( no outer layer taken off , for example ) , yes , it 's exactly the samewould the flour be more likely to increase blood sugar ? sorry for the very late answer . yes , it matters even the dimension of flour particles . coarser particles ( like those obtained from stone grinders ) rise less blood sugar than fine flour particles.sadly too much sodium in canned beans most of the time , need to rinse them and it does remove some nutrients ~ eden organics beans are low in sodium . cans are bpa-free . worth the higher price , in my book.the bpa-alternatives are being reported to be just as bad , if not worse , in their own way . google-it . credible science . call eden , ask them to switch over to glass containers . many organic companies do it for tomato sauce , applesauce , certain fruits , and much more . the only reason they don ’ t use glass , as far as i can tell , is because canned beans are part of our culture . the time is ripe to switch to glass , eden.fyi : eden already has a couple glass tomato products . so , i ’ m thinking they might be open to the idea of doing glass beans , depending on how much of a price increase it would entail.i think it would carry a lot of weight if dr. greger would reach out to eden and inform them of the credible science showing the bpa-free cans may not be so safe afterall . as far as cost , i think it is worth it . all we need is one company to do this . obviously people are willing to pay for glass , they are doing it now . and as far as cost , i ’ ve seen bottles of cooked foods inside large glass jars for less than 2 dollars at whole foods … .. bottles way bigger than a can of beans.could you be more specific about what bpa lining alternative is harmful & how ? according to the oregon environmental council , the oleoresin used by eden in bean cans is a safer alternative : http : / / www.oeconline.org / our-work / healthier-lives / tinyfootprints / toxic-prevention / safer-alternatives-to-bisphenol-a-bpathen , there are also the tetra paks used by 365 ( whole foods ) beans.the best alternative i ’ ve found ( after years of eating canned ) is to cook them in a slow cooker . it ’ s very easy you just set it up and ignore it . there ’ s no need to pre-soak your beans and you don ’ t have to be there to monitor the process or turn off the stove . cook ‘ em with a bay leaf , a whole garlic clove or two and a halved onion ( and no salt or they ’ ll get mushy ) and voila they taste great.what a relief . i ’ ve got about 20 cans of organic lentils to get through.20 cans ! oh sure its all fun and games with lentils until they explode . then who ’ s laughing … not to mention the psychedelic hallucinations . this has all been documented here https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = fyheace-v0k but does anyone ever talk about the real danger posed by uncontrolled lentil abuse ? noooo . the stigma of these little discs runs deep.sure we keep some in the house but strictly for medicinal use here mister . 20 cans ! just for personal use ? ? give over , gary . admit it , you ’ ve got a legume on your back … you ’ ve got a one-way ticket to … . lentilism ! keep going michael ! i think we , soon or later , will change the world ( environment , humans , and others species health ) for the better . that ’ s my hope.this is really good to know . in fact surprised that cooked is better than raw ( raw food eaters might not feel good about this , i am sure ) . my mom used to stress on eating sprouted than cooked but now with little difference , there is less pressure to sprout . what will be really interesting is to see the impact of both sprouting and cooking . any guesses ? : - ) i just edited this article on wikipedia : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / michael _ greger # criticism if someone wants to improve on that . the critisism of harriet a hall was left undebated , and that ’ s all a colleague required to completely dismiss nutritionfacts.org. and we can ’ t have that.anyone that considers gary tuabes a “ good writer ” , doesn ’ t really know that they ’ re talking about . he is notorious for omitting information from studies and simply making stuff up , in addition to choosing extremely poor quality studies that do not support his theories . it sounds like someone that doesn ’ t like what dr. greger has to share wrote that one.exactly. and it ’ s a shame that people take no further look than wikipedia to dismiss nutritionfacts.org , therefore it ’ s valuable that people take care of what is written on wikipedia about nutritionfacts.org. please help.han : i appreciate your effort . i didn ’ t even know that dr. greger had his own wikipedia page . that ’ s pretty cool.re : “ … that ’ s all a colleague required to completely dismiss … ” that says more about your colleague than it does about the wikipedia page . many of the wikipedia pages i ’ ve seen have some sort of “ the other side of the story ” section , whether legit or not . for example , there might be a section on “ safety ” for a food or “ environmental impact ” for a page on a package product . the existence of a wikipedia criticism or even it ’ s content should not be enough to sway a professional _ _ _ _ , uh anybody . * everyone * who is anyone has critics . and just because someone * says * that someone is say “ cherry picking ” doesn ’ t actually make it true . wikipedia is just reporting that someone said that . it ’ s pretty sad your colleague doesn ’ t get that.i ’ m sure you already get this point i ’ m making . i just thought writing these points out might provide some helpful verbiage for anyone who ends up having a similar conversation as you and your colleague in the future.while i agree with you that the wording on the wikipedia page needs some adjusting to be more accurate ( though i ’ m not the person the for the job ) , that page is still going to be a criticism section when all is said and done . so , someone as unsophisticated as your colleague is never going to make a lot of progress , at least not from sources like wikipedia.what bothers me more is the order of the sections . the “ criticism ” section should be much further down on the page . i think that would be more consistent with other pages i ’ ve seen . i don ’ t know if you can fix that or not . i just thought i would throw it out there.makes sense indeed . critisism should not be the second point . it should be the last.thanks for your feed . i moved it down a bit . somebody else noticed my effort and removed the section i added again . and i added it again . and thus an edit war has started.i just took a peak and the criticism section is at the bottom . go han ! ! : - ) thea , please help over here if you can : https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / talk : michael _ greger # don _ matesz _ mentionediting on wikipedia is really simple.han : i ’ m afraid that all of my free time is taken up right now – a large amount of it by nutritionfacts . i just wanted to express my appreciation for your effort.your post might encourage others to join in though . so , thanks for your post . : - ) and that ’ s also a great job . : - ) battle criticism with appreciation i would suggest . how many universities have invited him to speak ? if a list from universities to every other educational institution where lectures were given neutral facts turn into passive endorsement.the good doc is right wen he says sprouting is fun . fun sprout song at gg.gg / sprout-songhey , toxins , could you address the lectins issue here ? ( i know you ’ ve talked about them before – in other posts – and this seems a natural place to reiterate that info . ) this issue is particularly important in light of the recent research , published by oxford university press , showing that lectins in peanuts survive cooking and digestion and stick to cancer cells that are already in the blood , thus contributing to metastases. https : / / eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com / 2014 / 11 / 10 / breaking-anti-cancer-news-ditch-the-peanuts-and-spread-the-word / to what degree are lectins destroyed by sprouting alone ? by cooking ? by cooking and sprouting ? what temperatures must be used to destroy lectins ? are the lectins in some legumes ( the red kidney bean family , for example ) harder to destroy than in others ? are the lectins in smaller legumes ( e.g. , mung beans , lentils ) easier to get rid of than those in bigger legumes ? what about grains ? same questions.what about nuts and seeds ( pumpkin , sunflower , chia , etc . ) ? i ’ m particularly concerned about these because we usually don ’ t cook or sprout them . does soaking help ? to what degree are their lectins problematic ? this was so helpful – thanks ! after years of canned beans i ’ ve recently been using a slow cooker to make my cooked beans – just load it up and forget about it , so easy ! and i find the beans taste much better than canned.quick slow cooker basic bean recipe : 1 cup rinsed dried beans , 3 cups water , 1 bay leaf , 1 onion cut in half only , 2 whole garlic cloves , 1 thumbnail of peeled but whole fresh ginger . let cook on high 4 hours depending on the age and type of the bean ( older beans take longer , smaller beans less time ) . don ’ t add salt during the cooking as it will make the beans mushy . when done discard the flavoring items ( onion , etc ) . aging , alzheimer ’ s disease , anthocyanins , antioxidants , astrocytes , beans , boiling , brain disease , brain health , breast cancer , cancer , cans , chickpeas , chronic diseases , cognition , cooking methods , dementia , elderly , kale , kidney cancer , legumes , lentils , lou gehrig 's disease , parkinson 's disease , phenolics , phytonutrients , polyphenols , raw food , split peas , sprouting how do canned versus germinated beans ( such as sprouted lentils ) compare when it comes to protecting brain cells and destroying melanoma , kidney , and breast cancer cells . sprouting is so much fun ! i ’ ve got tons of videos on broccoli sprouts , for example : biggest nutrition bang for your buck.but again , whichever way we like them we should eat them . why ? see : mostly i just used canned . see canned beans or cooked beans ? other videos on practical prep tips include :
PLAIN-2549	how the egg board designs misleading studies serum cholesterol concentration is clearly increased by adding dietary cholesterol . in other words , putting cholesterol in our mouth means putting cholesterol in our blood , and it may also potentiate the harmful effects of saturated fats , meaning when we eat sausage and eggs , the eggs may make the effects of the sausage even worse . if we ate the saturated fat and cholesterol found in two sausages and egg mcmuffins every day for two weeks , our cholesterol would shoot up nearly 30 points . if we ate about the same saturated fat without the cholesterol , some kind of cholesterol-free sausage mcmuffins without the egg , what would happen ? now the egg would have saturated fat too , so to even it out we have to add three strips of bacon to this side . same saturated fat , but two eggs worth less cholesterol , would only bump us up to here . so yes , saturated fat may increase fasting cholesterol levels more than dietary cholesterol , but especially in the presence of dietary cholesterol.and this is measuring fasting cholesterol , meaning the baseline from which all our meal-related cholesterol spikes would then shoot . heart disease has been described as a postprandial phenomenon , meaning an after-meal phenomenon . milky little droplets of fat and cholesterol straight from a meal called chylomicrons can build up in atherosclerotic plaques just like ldl cholesterol . so what happens after a meal that includes eggs ? here ’ s what happens to the level of fat and cholesterol in our blood stream for the 7 hours after eating a meal with no-fat , no-cholesterol . hardly changes at all . but now a meal with fat and more and more egg yolk . triglycerides shoot up , and blood cholesterol shoots up.that ’ s the kind of data that ’ s bad for egg sales , so how could you design a study to hide this fact ? what if you only measured fasting cholesterol levels in the morning , seven hours after supper , you wouldn ’ t see a big difference between those that ate eggs the night before and those that didn 't . as the lead investigator of the smoking and egg study pointed out , measuring fasting cholesterol is appropriate for measuring the effects of drugs suppressing our liver ’ s cholesterol production , but not appropriate for measuring the effects of dietary cholesterol . after a cholesterol-laden supper , look what our arteries are being pummeled with all night long . and think about the day . how many hours are there between meals ? maybe four hours between breakfast and lunch ? so if we had eggs for breakfast we ’ d get that big spike and by lunch start the whole cycle of fat and cholesterol in our arteries all over again . so most of our lives are lived in a postprandial state , in an after-meal state , and this shows that the amount of cholesterol in those meals — they actually used eggs in this study , so the amount of egg in our meals makes a big difference when it really matters — after we ’ ve eaten , which is where we spend most of our lives . so that ’ s why when the egg board funds a study they only measure fasting cholesterol levels way out here somewhere. i think dr greger should get a big rubber stamp that says “ bad science ” on it and slam it down on misleading studies like this ! as long as he uses it on all “ bad science ” , and not just science that challenges his beliefs of what a healthy diet is . i suspect corporations are supporting research and studies for both low-fat and low-carb diets.this is a reasonable summary of some research from nusi : http : / / nusi.wpengine.com / wp-content / uploads / 2012 / 09 / summary-of-diet-studies-condensed.pdfthe video doesn ’ t talk about low-fat and low-carb diets . it talks about dietary cholesterol , particularily dietary cholesterol coming from eggs.but the original post that i replied to suggested a rubber stamp for all misleading studies . i was only saying that misleading studies exist in all areas , not just the pro-fat group , so the rubber stamp should be applied equally across all studies . this is something that nusi seems more qualified to do imho.as plant positive has pointed out on his youtube channel : nusi is a group of scientist supported by the meat industry who ’ s aim is to promote the eating of meat . if you believe what they say i ’ m afraid i have to tell you you have been misled.other than the fact that dr attia and gary taubes are the founders , the other board members and scientific advisory board seem excellent . i ’ ll also wait for them to start publishing research results and reading peer reviews before i pass judgement . i don ’ t know enough about plant positive to respect his opinion at this point.i think you should heed han ’ s warnings about nusi . please see plant positive for elaborated details. http : / / plantpositive.com / display / search ? moduleid = 19496100 & searchquery = nusii watched plant positives arguments against nusi , but it wasn ’ t very convincing . also did a quick search , and plant positive isn ’ t without his reputable critics either : http : / / anthonycolpo.com / why-primitivenutrition-aka-plant-positive-is-a-shameless-and-cowardly-liar / it ’ s interesting to note that anthony is also a critic of gary taubes – mostly because of his comments on exercise i guess.when nusi starts publishing results , i ’ ll certainly read it while understanding that 2 of the founders are low-carb diet promoters , and appreciate the possibility of bias . but if the study and results are good , and it stands up to peer review , then i ’ ll be willing to accept the results regardless of which position they support.as far as i can tell , dr attia seems to be genuine and above board , without ulterior motives.so you believe something is credible before it publish anything ? the fact that dr attia and gary taubes are behind this is a big no no for credibility . “ dr attia a genuine above board , without ulterior motives ” you mean the dr attia that fake emotion on ted ? he clearly doesn ’ t seem to be somebody without ulterior motives .. http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = kg4mvzaw7be # t = 27admit it , you have pick your side while claiming you ’ ve don ’ t … actually i said i ’ ll wait for them to start publishing results , and also this : “ read it while understanding that 2 of the founders are low-carb diet promoters , and appreciate the possibility of bias . ” . hence i ’ m trying to be open minded . it doesn ’ t make much sense to assume that is nusi simply a facade for the meat industry promoting their products before they actually do anything.dr attia does have a disclosure statement on his eating academy site also : http : / / eatingacademy.com / disclosuresand so what ? it don ’ t make him a respectable person by itself . especially if he lie like a scoundrel on his nutrition lecture … http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 92tjza1tc8u “ it don ’ t make him … . ” , nice.sorry , but english is not my birth language ( and i ’ ve learned it by myself ) so if u want to suggest a correction i can edit my old comment.actually , we are all waiting for them to start publishing results – and waiting and waiting . the low-carb community keep telling the public how healthy it is to load up on saturated fat , cholesterol and protein – only basic sanity ( and science ) point in an opposite direction . so i ’ ll stick to the whole foods plant based diet since that is what the best science points to for a healthy life . ( please do not send me any links to single studies showing low-carb is healthy , as i am talking about the body of science and not a few outliers with questionable results . it isn ’ t wrong to question the status quo , but if you are going to you better bring the evidence , and a lot of it , or you better stay home . ) how about sweden . reviewed 16,000 studies up until may 2013 and concluded that low-fat diets are not the solution : http : / / healthimpactnews.com / 2013 / sweden-becomes-first-western-nation-to-reject-low-fat-diet-dogma-in-favor-of-low-carb-high-fat-nutrition / love taubes.why are you sharing your uninformed opinion ? han : personal attacks are not allowed on this site . let ’ s keep the comments helpful and respectful.how should i respond to such nonsense remarks ? han : 1 ) you can gently , respectfully educate. or 2 ) ignore . you don ’ t have to respond to anyone . you may end up with a bloody tongue ( re the saying : “ you had to bite your tongue to keep from saying anything . ” ) , but this place will be much better for the discipline / maturity.i ’ ve been pleased with the results when people do choose to engage others respectfully . i ’ ve seen several community members who who started out very critical and ended up educated and enthusiastic . that doesn ’ t happen when personal attacks are involved . but you don ’ t have to engage when it doesn ’ t seem worth the effort or the logic of someone ’ s post is so backward that you can ’ t think of a way to logically respond . ( i ’ m not saying anything specific about this thread . that ’ s a general point based on many a posts here at nutritionfacts . ) i personally have appreciated your participation on this site . and i truly understand how very frustrating some posters can be . but the rules are important if nutritionfacts is going to be a good place for learning and support . i hope you will be a helpful contributing member going forward long into the future.i ’ m not exactly sure what i stated that was very frustrating for han . was it that i was questioning the analysis of nusi by plant positive by referring to anthony copolo as a critic ? theyfly : i can ’ t speak for any one else.since you asked , i will take the time to add the following as diplomatically as i can : i think you are sincere and trying your best . and yet , i had the exact same reaction that han did . i can ’ t imagine it is possible for any thinking person to actually have listened to all the massive amounts of the evidence that plant positive has against not only nusi , but dr. attia himself , using dr. attia ’ s own words and the real science , and come to a conclusion that the man is “ genuine and above board ” . wow . i meant it literally : i don ’ t believe it is possible – and i think you are doing your best to be a thinking person . thus , such a sincere belief ( your posts are not only polite ( a big compliment from me ! ) but also i believe quite sincere ) , can not come from a place of knowledge.what i see as positive is that you are trying to figure it all out . that puts you head and shoulders above many , many others . i hope you will be able to review credible research in the future . best of luck to you.thanks for your reply . i ’ ll do my best . and bite my tongue when i ’ m in a grumpy mood.again , the original post doesn ’ t directly talk about low-fat and low-carb diets , but ok yes i agree that bad science should be criticized whether or not we happen to agree with the thesis it seams to support.if you want to know my personal opinion of the low-carb vs low-fat debate , i think it ’ s a false dilemna . rawfoodists and frugivores tend to lose more weight than either groups . in fact , if anything , these diets tend to work “ too well ” for weight loss , enough that adopter often become underweight , especially if they have maintained their diet for a long time , which actually create problems of its own . notice that rawfoodists and frugivores have elements of both a low-fat and a lot-carb diet . both are vegan and hence eliminate animal fat and proteins , and also they also eliminate most starchy foods like grains . i think both fats and carbs are fattening if taken in large quantity and people should lose weight by cutting back on either , or ideally on a bit of both with moderation.but frugivores generally eat about 80 % of their calories from carbohydrates , and 10 % from fats . that puts them squarely in the “ low-fat ” group . also , it ’ s been shown that excess carbohydrates alone are not very fattening . it ’ s only when they are combined with a high-fat diet that they become fattening . the human body doesn ’ t do very much de novo lipogenesis ( conversion of carbohydrates into fat ) , despite what most people think . the body would rather burn off the excess carbohydrates as heat , than convert them to fat with a 30 % caloric loss in the process.the only way carbohydrates cause significant de novo lipogenesis , is by increasing blood insulin , which causes the body to store the fat from the meal . with a low-fat diet , there isn ’ t much fat in the food , so it ’ s difficult to gain weight , even when you overeat on carbohydrates . most of the excess just gets burned off.excess of any macronutrient will result in weight gain . when you eat low fat whole plant foods its difficult to gain weight because of the caloric density of the food . carbohydrates in cracker or bread form when eaten in excess can result in weight gain , as can dried fruits , when eaten in excess of caloric needs.this video should be sent to dr. nancy snyderman who was on the today show last week commenting on a study article stating eating more protein is best for weight loss . she went on to say protein from the “ incredible edible egg ” was a good option . it is not just confusing , but harmful when tv docs come on and add validity to these misleading studies . because dr. snyderman is a regular on the today show , her opinion is trusted and believed . i would like to see an opposing opinion aired or maybe have dr. barnard or dr. mcdougall be the regular commenting doctor . it is no doubt sponsorship at work here . as dr. mcdougall says , ” it ’ s business . ” as i say , it ’ s ignorant , irresponsible and reprehensible ! ! ! ! just like dr. oz . ( except he ’ s not ignorant , he knows very well what he ’ s doing – making money , and lots of it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ) . there is a reason that congress lambasted him. http : / / www.newsy.com / videos / mccaskill-scolds-dr-oz-for-miracle-weight-loss-claims / i call bunk on your “ most homeless people throw the food i give them away because what they really want are drugs ” homeless people aren ’ t generally in the habit of turning down food and shelter and other life-sustaining aid because it ’ s not the drugs they really wanted . somehow equating homeless people generally to spoiled children or coddled aristocracy is offensive and wrong.maybe you are correct where you live , but that is not the case here.our experience here is different . here 60-70 % of our homeless are dependent on pills ( eg norco , ms contin etc ) , heroin , amphetamine , methamphetamine , cocaine . this is also what i see in our office everyday when we drug test and many that we see are homeless . we have a prison release program that our county gets paid , for allowing “ non-violent ” criminals to get relocated here.one of my acquaintances is a lieutenant in the salvation army and they said it was disturbing them how many drug addicts they has seen of late , and they stated it all started after the relocation program began.this is just one of many experiences we have had here . we have a youth group that went and bought 100 tacos at taco bell for a large group of congregating homeless . the youth group was very surprised that when they were given the food they took the tacos and threw them in the trash can and stated , “ we don ’ t want your food , we want your money ! ” the australian heart foundation actually recommends eating six eggs a week , and has given the egg industry their “ tick ” of approval ( which is a recognised trademark authorised by the australian heart foundation , to indicate “ heart healthy ” foods ) , and now found on cartons of eggs up and down the country . it ’ s an absolute disgrace and the australian heart foundation gets lots of money for endorsing eggs with their “ tick . ” how many people is this propaganda killing ? it ’ s incredible how money and habit can utterly distort people ’ s judgement and perspective , to the detriment of their own values , health , and lives . ( and the egg propaganda is killing an unspeakable number of chickens , too ) .people love good news about their bad habits ! lolthe study on cholesterol consumption and serum cholesterol levels was from 1992 . i thought new research had debunked this and that now the wisdom is that the amount of cholesterol you eat doesn ’ t matter that much . i just completed a bs in nutrition and that ’ s what we were taught . please comment.which new research was that ? do you have links to the studies ? mercola , david perlmutter , masley , green med info and many many high level doctors are citing that only grass-fed or pastured eggs , meat and milk are good for you . in general , they are more focused on avoiding diabetes and alzheimer ’ s disease than cancer and atherosclerosis , but it really is something to be considered . john syeah , but what are they citing ? can you at least point to a specific argument from the crowd that you take to be very strong in promoting the healthfulness of pastured animal foods as being far above non-pastured ? i would hardly consider mercola and perlmutter to the best sources , by the way . they are clearly in the business of peddling supplements at this point.it seems clear you got the bs part . i got my bs degree from bsu ( true ) . such baloney they teach too often . as noted above … .. and published in the journal of the american college of

cornell.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / eggs-and-cholesterol-patently-false-and-misleading-claims / it helps to review the other links he has posted below his videosthe china study , really ? talk about propaganda ! ironically , this video is attempting to explain to you how this “ new research ” was fraudulently designed ( by egg industry “ scientists ” ) to “ debunk ” the reality that eating cholesterol raises your cholesterol levels . the “ new research ” to which you refer was specifically designed to mislead by leaving out crucial details . for example , if you already have high serum cholesterol , eating an extra egg daily will not change your serum cholesterol much . however , if you start on a 0 cholesterol diet as a baseline ( the only valid scientific way to test this hypothesis ) and first establish a low serum cholesterol ( ≤ 180 mg / dl ) you will find that adding an egg a day to the diet dramatically raises serum cholesterol . here ’ s an example of research that showed what happens when you add cholesterol ( eggs ) to the diet of people habituated to a very low cholesterol intake : http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 35 / 4 / 741.full.pdf dr. greger has many other videos on this same topic.are you the “ owner ” of this site ? http : / / donmatesz.blogspot.it / yes.it ’ s an interesting site , probably it will be the next in my favourites.keep up the good work ! i visited your site and listened to the first video about low fat high carbohydrate diets . i do agree with you completely about the calorie theory and i think what you said about over cutting calories was very sensible as well . you did say that few people can lose weight consuming between 2500 and 3000 calories a day . i actually am a person who did this . i did this by bicycling absolutely everyday for at least an hour . i now maintain a 100 pound weight loss for 4 years consuming about 3500 calories a day . i often bicycle for 2 hours or even more a day . i count calories to make sure i am eating enough , but not too much . i also agree with your statements that a plant based diet helps persons to eat fewer calories than they are burning without feeling hungry- mainly because of the fiber content . if i ate * all * that i wanted , it would be at least 10,000 calories a day . eating a more whole foods , nutrient dense whole foods plant based diet helps me to be satisfied without eating * all * that i want . my three core beliefs about weight control are to 1. eat the * right * number of calories each day , not too few or too many . 2 . daily exercise 3 . whole foods , high fiber , high nutrient plant based diet.i am a frech md . i learnt decades ago that eating dietary cholesterol had no effect on a patient having normal level of cholesterol . we learnt also that eggs have to come from controlled production , to not eat more than 6 eggs a week , including the eggs used to cook ( cream , sauce etc ) , no white before 1 year old children to not inhibit the biotin from the yolk , etc consuming too much eggs altering the liver metabolism and more . here in the us the consumers are lost.here is where you are wrong with the dietary cholesterol / serum cholesterol idea . “ serum cholesterol concentration is clearly increased by added dietary cholesterol but the magnitude of predicted change is modulated by baseline dietary cholesterol . the greatest response is expected when baseline dietary cholesterol is near zero , while little , if any , measurable change would be expected once baseline dietary cholesterol was > 400-500 mg / d . people desiring maximal reduction of serum cholesterol by dietary means may have to reduce their dietary cholesterol to minimal level ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 55 / 6 / 1060.full.pdfbasically , if you start with low cholesterol and you consume dietary cholesterol , the effect will be great , but if you stat with high cholesterol and consume dietary cholesterol , then the effect will not be noticeable.here we have a case study of a man who was put on a high and low cholesterol diet from eggs . when he ate the cholesterol , serum cholesterol went up , when he didn ’ t , it went down . this up and down graph went on for 12 months . clearly for this individual , dietary cholesterol raised serum cholesterol , as his cholesterol went up to around the 250 range and back down to around the 170 range with and without the cholesterol.http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / 0091743572900771another interesting study took people who were insulin sensitive , insulin resistant , and obese + insulin resistant and put them on different egg feeding groups . the insulin sensitive group had an average total cholesterol of 186 , which was much better then the insulin resistant group who had an average total of 209 . after 4 eggs per day , the insulin sensitive group had a much bigger increase in serum cholesterol then the insulin resistant group . not only this , but apo b increased , the so called small dense ldl particles , the “ bad kind ” many paleo proponents make note of.http : / / atvb.ahajournals.org / content / 23 / 8 / 1437.longagain , an old forgotten ( but still relevant ) study on eggs . young healthy participants started out with cholesterol numbers averaging 195 . they controlled for all macronutrients , keeping carbs , fats and proteins constant . the only thing that changed in the intervention was cholesterol . they added 6 eggs , a copious amount of cholesterol to their diet , after which cholesterol shot up to 253 . and yet again , the feared small ldl particle count was increased by the eggs.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1129159 / pdf / jcinvest00767-0060.pdfnon vegetarian and semi-vegetarians ’ biomarkers were taken . the semi-vegeterians had much lower cholesterol starting out ( but still not great ) then the full omnivorous counterparts . when given dietary cholesterol , their serum cholesterol went up because their baseline was not too high as in other studies . clearly this evidence along with the ones above show that dietary cholesterol raises serum cholesterol when the baseline is not already high.http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 59 / 6 / 1325.longa maximum of 6 eggs a week is not 6 eggs a day . i have never been an advocate of eggs and cholesterol rich food . i have always prescribed no more that 2 eggs a week when the numbers are normal or low , and zero when they are higher . working on lowering cholesterol with different teas and plants , with success , i favor vegetarian and pescetarian diet , with almost all being bio or organic food , spring water , all wrapped with portion control . this is for people without a special care to address . these rules are supposed to maintain blood tests in normal range and pathology at bay . people under these diet enjoy to walk and exercise because they feel life in their body . they may have from time to time extra decadent meals , and this add a touch of freedom . the french paradox is for me the discipline to eat everyday in accordance to be healthy , and to feel free to make some extra tasty adventures , just in a limited time to be good the day after .again , the rule of diminishing returns that is implied in hopkins ’ meta-analysis and review means that in that study with 6 eggs / day added leading to a cholesterol increase of + 58mg / dl , 6 eggs per week in the same context would be estimated to give an increase of at least 58 / 7 = + 8.3 mg / dl from eggs alone , much of it in the ldl fraction . that still isn ’ t good if we ’ re considering such a small fraction of dietary energy , with other ways to screw up the lipid profile . if we want to live a long time in good health , there ’ s a long time for these small increases to create pathology . i don ’ t necessarily want to delay a health incident at age 50 to something similar that would happen at age 75 . i want the whole atherosclerotic process to have minimal outcomes for as long as i live , and that demands a lot.the atherosclerotic process starts after birth . when i worked on patients over 100 years old in good shape , they did not have too much exclusion as eggs etc .. in another hand they were not eating an egg a day . if you eat an egg with spinach , or any other kind of greens , the cholesterol is regulated by your metabolism and you lipids will stay normal . if you eat 2 eggs , fried with bacon your lipids will show an increased level corrected if you eat enough vegetables in the 48 hours . if you drink 3 cups of good quality of tea , hunan , puh ’ er tea , and more , i have worked on studies decades ago , the blood cholesterol level is regulated , lower in 3 weeks . genes are also a part of the response to regulate atherosclerotic process , as well as exercises . the metabolism is regulated by a number of parameters that are not all discovered . reasons you see contradictory papers . are you familiar with the japanese diet , i prefer the okinawan diet using sweet potatoes and they have centenarians but they have no eggs , no neuro-degenerative diseases , no breast cancer , by taste i like it very much , my blood test are younger than my birth age but i was never ever able to have an american to do it , i had french patients on it , because french believe that we have to eat to live and not to live to eat , except sometime . if you want the minimal outcome from atherosclerosis enjoy okinawan diet . american do not eat enough sweet potatoes , seaweeds etc good lucki wish you had at least some citations to go with that soliloquy , such as the bit about spinach.i am writing a book about nutrition with these traditional association and the science behind to support the usage through old time . i am in the us to launch blood pumps for rescue , i need to finish to write 3 patents for these new blood pumps i have “ invented ” . the book is more for my pleasure but as a md i need to be specific when i present benefits of food association , because people as you want that precision . i may remember the oxalate responsible of blocking the reabsorption , as sorrel used in sauce to block the lipid cycle of absorption , oxalate is also the reason to not eat more than once a week spinach . i may publish in my facebook page “ all about spinach ” , with verified scientific memories it may be helpful.cool. would like to see.toxins : i meant to say this earlier . i ’ m so glad you are back ! i know that i ’ m not the only one missing your comments . there was another person who asked about you recently too . your posts continue to be so helpful and so high quality ! thanks thea , i have my ins and outs with this site for various reasons . i like to keep up with it when i can . to be fair , a lot of the information i share comes from studies already shared by dr. greger or plant positive . i try to put it all together and make a picture.it ’ s that “ putting it all together ” in direct response to someone ’ s question or comment that is so great . i have a hard time doing that myself and it is what people need.i certainly understand the “ ins and outs ” need . i ’ m the same way myself . i just wanted to say something so that you knew you had been missed . : - ) thank you ! ok . you make your point about the effects of dietary cholesterol on blood serum cholesterol . what about blood serum cholesterol levels being linked to heart disease ? http : / /

collection of studies.http : / / plantpositive.com / 18-cholesterol-confusion-1-pri / 8 indians in 1982 ? do you call that a scientific research ? the very fact you point to this outdated stuff makes your point pointless.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / debunking-egg-industry-myths / this study above is from 2013 . keep in mind that what is taught in nutrition programs is often just from what is found in text books and funded by dairy / egg / etc. foundationsnadaa : thank you for your comment . it is always interesting to me when recent graduates talk about their education.i wanted to make a joke about the bs in your bs degree too , but looks like i wasn ’ t fast enough.to answer your question , i highly recommend that you take a look at the work done by “ plant positive ” . this person has done a series of highly in-depth , scholarly work on this topic and other related topics on nutrition . his videos includes all the citations / copies of the source materials . he has a series of videos on the topic of “ cholesterol confusion ” . because you have a degree in this field , i would expect that you will be able to follow the work and understand why it answers your question.the website follows if you are interested . he also has a channel on youtube . the videos are listed in a pannel on the right side of the screen . you may want to watch the whole thing . his videos are fascinating and often fun. http : / / plantpositive.com / hope that helps.you beat me to it thea , plant positive is incredible . my number 2 to nutritionfacts.org.i found this study from 2010 , http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 21076725 which pretty much agreed with greger about the importance of not doing a fasting test , but a post prandial test . this said that the belief that eggs are harmless is a misplaced belief . there is much research to back this up , but the egg industry , as well as the low carb movement have been conducting sham studies to undermine this fact.the same studies used to “ debunk ” the cholesterol studies are just as old if not older , and often times say the opposite of what people think . what i am trying to say is , many old studies have been incorrectly cited on the internet , and do not show at all what they are saying . this is common practice at the weston price foundation , where information is simply invented . they count on you not fact checking , which is why this website is such a valuable tool . for more on the myth of the “ cholesterol myth ” , i encourage you to visit here for details. http : / / plantpositive.com / research from 1992 is hardly valid in the world of science . this video is short and skewed to a personal position of cholesterol from eggs is bad without providing current research to truly , continually support the ‘ cholesterol is bad ’ research . i realize the point is to show how the industry ‘ tricks ’ the results to indicate no overall rise in cholesterol levels . one must also wonder , if cholesterol spikes ( like glucose , amino acids , and other fats do ) postprandial , and then subsequently drops the next morning , is it truly causing atherosclerosis during it ’ s peak levels postprandial ? the most interesting part is truly the saturated fat / cholesterol combination . i eat eggs combined with a healthy , low saturated fat diet , which this video shoes does not really cause a rise in postprandial cholesterol levels . this video is too short and lacks many variables that would need to be addressed to determine that the industry is ‘ tricking ’ us into thinking cholesterol from eggs is the cause of atherosclerosis . furthermore , the bs degree in nutrition is not bullshit . clearly it ’ s taught a few people to think critically about information that is being distributed that does not have solid sources to back it up.information can be truly stunning ! ! ! visited a health food store in our nice area / neighborhood yesterday . while it has been there for years / i hadn ’ t been there for quite some time / whole foods is closer . guy didn ’ t know greger / or mcdougall , was totally down with grains … .gmos … .all bad for you except oats ; was paleo / generally , just flabergasted . then gave me some photocopies … among them : eat the whole egg citing a november 2004 from the jean mayer us department of agriculture

research laboratory , the university of western ontario … .talking about the need to consume complete proteins ( animal products ) ; and in a handout about nutrition 101 / talked about protein / all were animal in nature . truly incredible . this from one of the true / independent / ” health food / herbal ” stores in a major metropolitan area.don ’ t be fooled by the label “ health food store ” . they may be organic and non-gmo but definitely not anti animal products.he uses the example of a sausage mcmuffin which uses and english muffin which is the same as white bread on both sides . what happens when you eat eggs without sugar or without the english muffin ? what happens to all these studies when sugar is eliminated from the diet . i ’ ve been eating high protein which includes about 20 eggs per week for a very long time . yes corporate greed is terribly annoying and does kill people . what about unbiased reports on studies ? aren ’ t they important too ? please feel free to correct me . i ’ m not bias about very much and very willing to learn.for starters , do you have anything backing your apparent belief that sugar and refined carbohydrate potentiates the effects of dietary cholesterol on serum cholesterol ? i say that you must believe this in some way since you are committed to a high-egg , high-protein ( and therefore probably low-carbohydrate ) diet.simple fact is he got his science wrong . he did not address all the effects of all ingredients combined . you can ’ t argue that . and no , i ’ m not committed to a high egg diet . it just happens to be what i am trying right now . for a science type you sure do make a lot of assumptions.i made an inference . if an egg diet is what you are trying why don ’ t you just get a postprandial test of your lipids and see ? cut out the sugar if you are consuming it , of course . at the point of practice , i think it ’ s silly to assume that it ’ s reasonably likely that sugar has this unusual effect on eggs and that it ’ s strong enough to protect you from the harmful aspects indicated in egg-feeding studies that may not have succesfully eliminated all sugar because they didn ’ t try to . put another way , they didn ’ t try to eliminate all dietary boron in that study . but this is a concern why ? what mechanism makes a boron hypothesis plausible ? same thing with sugar : what makes it reasonably plausible that there is a mechanism for sugar to potentiate the effects of dietary cholesterol ? the oatmeal group has an improvement in the lipid profile compared with the egg group in the ’ 05 study , so clearly the carbohydrate group in this scenario was beneficial.where might i find some reference to this study toxins . i ’ m about to try plant base food again , but i had trouble with the hunger pains.http : / / www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com / article / s0167-5273 % 2804 % 2900139-1 / abstractalso , if you eat a starch centered diet , feeling hungry will not be an issue . just be sure they are from whole food sources.no , that is incorrect . my recent discovery over the past few months is that my obesity came from a starch centered diet . sorry but that ’ s absolute bullshit . i have eliminated my food cravings with with a high protein low carb diet.no need to get so intense , let me rephrase . starches being beans , whole grains , and tubers , not from refined grains and added sugars . weight loss from a low carb diet is simply a result of a reduction in calories , http : / / annals.org / article.aspx ? articleid = 1900694low carb diets are strongly inked with higher all cause mortality , so i would be cautious advocating a diet known to be quite unhealthful.my apologies . from the atkins diet to the low carb high fat diet , there is just so much crap out there , i am finding it difficult to sift through it . so yes , i am being little intense because i am frustrated . it seems everyone has a study to prove their brand of diet . i have tried to embrace the plant based diet in the past , but hunger was the issue . now that i am completely off of sugar it would seem reasonable that the starches you mention should look after the hunger issue . thank you and thanks for your patient reply to me toxins.i understand , there is a lot of junk information out on the internet regarding nutrition. nutritionfacts.org is an extremely reliable resource , as is http : / / plantpositive.com / studies that support low carb diets generally do not compare groups of people who consume healthful starches . please see here for more.http : / /

think it ’ s a must for who want to research seriously the matter of human nutrition.i also think its a must for anyone who wants to separate fact from fiction regarding the low carb craze.i agree with youthere is this recent book “ brain grain ” which is stating that high cholesterol in itself is not bad , but even considered good for the brain . only in combination with inflammation it is causing problems . what do you think about that ? from what i understand , sugar causes inflammation . but it would be nice to hear from the doctors and scientists on that.marion welter , i ’ m inclined to agree with your remark , “ only in combination with inflammation it is causing problems . ” furthermore , here ’ s something mds , who push statin rx ’ s very readily don ’ t tell patients / the public : a perfectly healthy , normal liver produces between 2 thousand and 3 thousand mgs of cholesterol a day . cholesterol is needed for life processes : glands , hormones , bone building , and even the brain manufactures some . personally , i think if big pharma ’ s vested interest in statin drugs were to get out of the way , the cholesterol ‘ myth ’ would be evaluated and resolved correctly . when i studied nutrition , lipids / cholesterol norm values were : cholesterol 300 ; triglycerides 200 , and they stayed in that range until big pharma came out with cholesterol-reducing drugs , the statins , which have serious adverse effects in themselves . if you don ’ t believe that , may i suggest reading the 2010 book , “ the risks of prescription drugs , ” edited by donald w light , phd , publisher : columbia university press . in my opinion as a natural nutritionist , nothing is more problematic for increasing cholesterol than all the ‘ plastic ’ fats , e.g , , trans fats people eat in their junk food diets , plus the always-rancid fats that are used in deep fryers frying foods in fast food joints [ heat changes the chemical structure of fats ] , plus chemically-extruded cooking oils we freely pour from bottles onto salads , use in cooking , and think are not harming us . may i suggest readers do their research and check out the adverse effects / downsides of polyunsaturated oils ; rancid fats / oils ; and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.we do not need cholesterol since we have a pathway that sintetize it … http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki

await your videos on gmo . i was so happy to hear that you are delving into the matter and know that what you will find will help us all sort it out . until proof of ‘ non-harm ’ is determined by non-gmo scientists , i am trying to avoid all gmo products . not easy when the government won ’ t help us with labels . i know that you will figure it out and that your influence will have great impact on many people . i am currently supporting oregon and colorado in their fight for labeling ( i live in wa where gmo producers tricked many of us into not labeling with million dollar ads that they illegally donated through a third party corporation .. under lawsuit but a little too late ) . i am also supporting maui county with their initiative for a moratorium to stop monsanto ( and the others ) for 18 months until they prove to the citizens that this is not harming the fragile hawaiian environment . maui county is the gmo testing ground zero where 80 % of all gmo seeds are tested including gmo corn designed to grow pharmaceutical drugs . before a field of gmo are grown these companies completely sterilize the soil destroying all good bacteria , micro organisms , fungi and good things built up in the soil over millions of years . they get to dump 4 times as many toxic chemicals in hawaii because they can get 4 growing seasons there vs one in the mainland crops . this is the biggest concern for all mankind in my opinion . i believe we as a race will be able to combat climate change with technology but if we all become sterile and no more babies are born we won ’ t be able to save ourselves let alone the planet . so , don ’ t eat it .. don ’ t experiment with your lives or your children ’ s lives . it is difficult without labels but until the science is studied by non profit-oriented scientists and the truth is known , just say no to being a human ‘ lab rat ’ .what can you do for ringing of the earsthis is generally called ‘ tinnitus ’ in medical terms ; knowing

just like the honey pot ! ; ) egg on their face ! dr. greger , your comments would explain why so many doctors tell their patients to ignore dietary cholesterol . the doctors only see fasting blood levels . however , i have read that on balance eggs are ok because not only do they raise ldl but the also raise hdl . more importantly they also raise particle size for ldl . if this is true , it would seem to offset much of the harm that you outline here . could you please comment on this ? aa : the following video from plant positive goes into great detail explaining the flaws of the particle size argument . the info about particle size is not right up front , but he does get to it : http : / / plantpositive.com / 25-cholesterol-confusion-8-a-l / great info . hope it helps.there ’ s been an interesting debate around hdl in the literature . yes , higher hdl / total cholesterol ratios are associated with lower risk , but is hdl itself causing this , or are there other factors that increase both hdl levels and reduce risk , responsible for the association ? for example , exercise increases hdl , but also has independent effects on collateral vascularisation , ampk activation etc. that would decrease risk independently of the higher hdl.a number of hdl-raising drug trials ( notably with niacin and torcetrapib ) have failed to reduce cardiac risk 1 . more damning , genetic predispositions to higher hdl levels appear offer no protection 2 , 3 , while genetic predispositions to lower ldl , triglycerides , and lp ( a ) have all been confirmed as protective . troubling results for those whose careers have been built on the hdl hypothesis 4.one resolution may be that its only the small hdl particles that are functional and protective 5 , but as the test to directly measure these ( apo a-i ) is expensive , its rarely done in primary prevention , and few nutrition studies are recent enough test this directly . the one i found on eggs found that they increase the large ( and arguably non-protective ) hdl fraction 6.dr. greger transcript on the subject : [ and be sure to check out neal barnard ’ s new blog post on cvs health ( ? ) ; classic ! ! ! ! / and of course right on , dr. barnard . ] transcript : eggs and cholesterol : patently false and misleading claimsfor decades , “ on the basis of concerns from the american heart association and consumer groups , the federal trade commission carried out successful legal action – upheld by the supreme court-to compel the egg industry to cease and desist from false and misleading advertising that eggs had no harmful effects on health . ” see “ anti-cholesterol attacks on eggs resulted in severe economic loss through a reduction in egg consumption , ” so the egg industry created a “ national commission on egg nutrition ” to combat the anti-cholesterol , anti-egg publicity with ads like this , exclaiming there is no scientific evidence whatsoever that eating eggs in any way increases the risk of heart attack , ” which the u.s. court of appeals found patently false and misleading.even the tobacco industry wasn ’ t that brazen , instead of just trying to introduce the element of doubt , arguing that the relationship between smoking and health remains an open question . the egg ads made 7 claims , each of which , in truth and in fact was determined to be.the court determined the egg industry ads were and are , false , misleading , and deceptive . in fact legal scholars view what the tobacco industry tried to do as the same as what the american egg board ’ s national commission on egg nutrition tried to do . as with the egg ads , the tobacco industry did more that just espouse one side of a genuine controversy but just denies the existence of scientific evidence.over the last 36 years , the american egg board has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to convince people eggs are not going to kill them — and it ’ s working . “ in combination with aggressive nutrition science and public relations efforts , research shows that the advertising has been effective in decreasing consumers concerns over eggs and cholesterol / heart health . ” this is from their internal strategy documents i got a hold of.currently they ’ re targeting moms . their approach is to “ surround moms wherever they are . ” they pay integration fees for egg product placement in tv shows . to integrate eggs into the biggest loser , for example , could be a million dollars . but getting some kids storytime reading program to integrate eggs may only take half a million , though . the american egg board keeps track of who is and is not a “ friend-of-eggs ” they pay scientists $ 1500 to sit and answer questions like “ what studies can help disassociate eggs from cardiovascular disease ? ” from the beginning , their arch nemesis was the american heart association , with whom they fought a major battle over cholesterol . in documents retrieved through the freedom of information act , we see even the usda repeatedly chastising the egg industry for misrepresenting the american heart association position . in a draft letter to magazine editors , the egg industry tried to say that the “ american heart association changed its recommendations to approve an egg a day in 2000 and eventually eliminated its number restrictions on eggs in 2002 , ” to which the head of usda ’ s poultry research and promotion programs had to explain , the quote-unquote change in 2000 wasn ’ t a change at all . nothing in the guidelines or recommendations was changed . what happened is that in response to a question posed by someone planted in the audience , heart association reps acknowledged that even though eggs are the most concentrated source of cholesterol in the diet , since an individual egg had under 300mg of cholesterol technically an egg could fit under the 300 mg daily limit , and in 2002 they just eliminated the specific mention of eggs for consistency sake , but the aha insists that they haven ’ t changed their position and continue to warn consumers about eggs.so here ’ s from the aha website at the time . if one egg has 213 and the limit for people with normal cholesterol is 300 you could fit an egg in if you cut down on all other animal products . you have an egg for breakfast , and some coffee , some skinless turkey breast etc . , you could end up at 510 , nearly twice the recommended limit . so if you are going to eat an egg you need to substitute vegetables for some of the meat , drink your coffee black , and watch for hidden eggs in baked goods . and the limit for folks with high cholesterol is 200mg a day , which may not even allow a single egg a day.this is how the senior director of nutrition education at the american egg board ’ s egg nutrition center characterized the american heart association guidelines : “ maybe i ’ m being overly sensitive , but this reads like : if you insist on having those deadly high cholesterol eggs your penalty will be to eat vegetables and you can ’ t even have the yummy steak and creamy coffee you love . really it ’ s not worth eating eggs . oh , and if you think you ’ ll be able to enjoy some delicious baked goods , forget it , the deadly eggs are there too ! ” hi doc , when you eat your “ two sausages and egg mcmuffins ” and your cholesterol numbers go up , why do you blame the problem on the sausages and eggs ? why not mcmuffins ? because feeding people more and more egg yolks increases postprandial ldl more and more , for one . did you not see the other research that was cited in video ? the mcmuffin bit showed that switching bacon for eggs in the mcmuffins kept saturated fat constant , english muffin count constant , and changed ldl . it wasn ’ t a change in the number of english muffins that caused the change of ldl in that context , was it ? do you think that the bacon was protective compared with the eggs because of some reason other than the dietary cholesterol ? but i do agree the study would have been better if they just ate the eggs and sausage and cheese . nasty stuff ! sorry this was supposed to be a reply to jason.my ipad doesn ’ t behave with the changes to the website.the actual study being referenced has nothing explicitly to do with breakfast sandwiches , as far as i can tell . it worked with complete meal plans specified for the entire day . you have to listen carefully to catch gregor stating that he ’ s using the mcmuffin as an example of the sort of variation in dietary fat and cholesterol that they were exploring , rather than referring to the concrete details of the study.you are right . here is the study . no mcmuffin. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc295526 / ? page = 1so let me get this straight . you are asking why would cholesterol numbers go up from the sausage and egg and not the english muffin ? i would recommend that you click on the references he lists . and read those.eggs and sausage have a ton of cholesterol . if you consume them your cholesterol goes up . english muffins have about 1 gram of fat and no cholesterol unless of course you make your bread with butter but that isn ’ t usually the recipe.so i guess my question to you is why would you blame it on the english muffin ? i listened to jimmy moore , who is of course a low carber. when he interviewed neal barnard , he stated that westman ” s research ( he is also low carb who does research on low carb diets ) shows that low carb high animal fat diets raise ldl cholesterol . he did say , however , that it raised hdl cholesterol as well . moore admitted that barnard ’ s diet lowered ldl , but also lowered hdl . why not , instead of eating saturated fat to raise both , just eat plants , no animals and then exercise to raise the hdl ? my ldl used to be very high , it is now 85 without statins . my hdl used to be below 20 and now with all the exercise i do , it is over 80 and i eat no animal products whatsoever , or as little as possible . of course losing the weight helped me to correct my numbers as well.http : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2005 / 05 / 28 / cholesterol-heart.aspxas stated before here , mercola is a for profit “ nutrition ” business . do not trust the skewed interpretations from him.toxin i agree . i cringe when i see him referenced.i had to say that i do not trust mercola anymore about nutrition , he seems to be a cholesterol confusionist.after years of searching nasa has discovered a new planet that is just like earth … so they ’ re gonna keep looking.your “ how the egg board designs misleading studies ” video assumes that saturated fat and cholesterol are bad for health , but you provide no evidence to show that this is so . studies show that dietary saturated fat is very good health , provided that such fat has not been heated to smoking point at any time prior to consumption . also , research is clearly showing that dietary cholesterol is good for health ; in fact the higher the level of cholesterol in the body the better for health . the amount of cholesterol in the blood is not the problem , whether it be ldl or hdl ( the higher the better ) . the amount of ldl particles that are oxidized is the problem . so we need to avoid oxidative stress rather than avoid cholesterol per se . russell eaton , http : / / www.deliveredonline.comrussell , this is a paleo myth that has been spreading all over the internet . saturated fat raises cholesterol , and cholesterol oxidizes to cause heart disease . what causes oxidation ? inflammation . what causes inflammation ? saturated fats found in animal based foods . its well understood . this videos you just watched shared studies showing that eggs result in inflammation . i encourage you to explore this video set for details. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / endotoxemia / thank you ‘ toxins ’ for your reply . the consumption of saturated fat does not raise blood cholesterol in any circumstances . but i fully agree that saturated fats in cooked animal-based foods cause inflammation and hence oxidize ldl particles . but why ? the answer is that cooked animal-based food contains heated saturated fat . as a consequence , the heated saturated fat goes rancid when consumed , this creates free radicals , and the free radicals oxidize small ldl particles which then contriubute to plaque build-up . non-heated saturated fat , such as coconut oil ( or even butter ) has no effect on blood cholesterol . you want your ldl and hdl to be as high as possible , but you don ’ t want to do anything that causes ldl particles to become oxidized , such as eating heated fats , smoking , etc . the idea that we should be trying to reduce levels of cholesterol in the body is a myth. http : / / www.deliveredonline.comrussell could you post some research that supports your claims ? it is helpful for me to read those articles . thanks.the diet-heart hypothesis — which holds that eating cholesterol and saturated fat raises cholesterol in our blood — originated with studies in both animals and humans more than half a century ago . however , more recent ( and higher quality ) evidence doesn ’ t support it . it ’ s true that some studies show that saturated fat intake raises blood cholesterol levels . but these studies are almost always short-term , lasting only a few weeks . longer-term studies have not shown an association between saturated fat intake and blood cholesterol levels . in fact , of all of the long-term studies examining this issue , only one of them showed a clear association between saturated fat intake and cholesterol levels , and even that association was weak . to be clear : eating cholesterol and saturated fat does not raise cholesterol levels in the blood . but ironically , we do in fact want to have a naturally high level of cholesterol in the blood ( both ldl and hdl ) .on any given day , we have between 1,100 and 1,700 milligrams of cholesterol in our body . 25 % of that comes from our diet , and 75 % is produced inside of our bodies by the liver . much of the cholesterol that ’ s found in food can ’ t be absorbed by our bodies , and most of the cholesterol in our gut was first synthesized in body cells and ended up in the gut via the liver and gall bladder . the body tightly regulates the amount of cholesterol in the blood by controlling internal production ; when cholesterol intake in the diet goes down , the body makes more . when cholesterol intake in the diet goes up , the body makes less.this is further explained ( with full supporting evidence ) in a new book i will be releasing shortly , to be titled : the lipo diet.russell eaton http : / / www.deliveredonline.comoh my . where to begin . all i can say is links ? do you just disregard all science ? as soon as the book comes ( the lipo diet ) i will let you know . i am not trying to plug the book , but i can assure you that it is fully referenced . all the best , russell eaton , the lipo dietthis is the kind of popular information out there for these low carb fad diets . there is no evidence for such claims though obviously . good calories bad calories is a great example of how a book with many citations does not actually say what the citations say . anything said in an authoritative manner can sound believable.i am frustrated because i go on other blogs and there are two people who keep spouting off this low carb nonsense and because they sound “ authoritative ” they get many recommends . one example of this low carb nonsense is the idea that whole grains cause diabetes because they are turned into glucose . one low carber got 26 recommends on the well.blogs.nytimes.com saying this very same thing , but i got no recommends saying that there is no research to indicate that whole grains contribute to diabetes . the opposite is true- whole grains with all their fiber help prevent it.whole grains have been demonized by the low carbers , the only evidence they can muster is that people can have celiac disease and that there was once an epidemic in asia of beriberi due to low b vitamin count from consuming only white rice . if brown rice is consumed these issues no longer occur . evidence against whole grains is like grasping at straws , while the evidence for consuming it is quite great . a good example of grasping at straws is one of the only negative studies on whole grains that is published and is not referenced by any other study , and that is loren cordain ’ s review paper , who is in fact a low carber himself.i finally got * one * recommend on this article http : / / well.blogs.nytimes.com / 2014 / 09 / 08 / prediabetes-blood-sugar / ? _ php = true & _ type = blogs & module = blogpost-title & version = blog % 20main & contentcollection = personal % 20health & action = click & pgtype = blogs & region = body & _ r = 0 stating that there is no research evidence to indicate that whole grains contribute to diabetes . this is one of the newest comments made , so it is one of the first you would find in the comments section . if you go far down , the person who said they did now has 30 recommends . it is sad that so many persons buy into this low carb dogma.this is why we should always be skeptics of what people say , and investigate the facts . that is one reason why nutritionfacts.org is such a great resource.i clicked on the link and one of the claims was that exercise makes people fat . this is completely the opposite of my own experience . once i started to bicycle everyday to work as well as other places , my weight really plummeted much further than it ever had in over thirty years . i didn ’ t have to go on a very low calorie diet . i have kept off this weight ( 100 pounds ) for over 4 years now without any regain whatsoever . since losing the weight , i have transitioned to a plant based diet and have lost even more weight than i did before without cutting calories . i just rode my bike for three hours today , and i don ’ t feel particularly ravenous- in fact , strenuous exercise often kills my hunger . i think eating a high fiber plant based diet also helps control the excess hunger that might come after exercise . fiber promotes satiety . i have known many people who have lost weight by exercise and have kept off for many years by continuing to exercise . a great combination is a whole foods plant based diet with exercise . my cholesterol level is also lower with exercise and a plant based diet . my hdl is much higher than before and my ldl is much lower.that ’ s great daniel . there will always be exceptions . for the sake of your health i urge you to never do exercise ( just physical activity ) . in the book ‘ exercise makes you fat ’ the word ‘ exercise ’ is defined as any kind of physical exertion that is sufficiently vigourus to make you sweaty and / or breathless ( bad for health and for losing weight ) . ‘ physical activity ’ is just that : physical activity that does not make you sweaty and / or breathless . i appreciate your comments.i don ’ t agree that exercise that leaves a person “ breathless ” is what makes people gain fat . my experience is that leisurely walks which don ’ t leave a person breathless are pretty ineffective for weight loss . what i bicycled everyday and went up some hills and became breathless at times did my weight go down . my health is infinitely better than it was before . there is much research to indicate that high intensity exercise is more effective for weight loss than leisurely exercise . however , i tend to think that * mostly * moderate exercise with some high intensity intervals is most effective . i don ’ t think there is any evidence whatsoever from any study to indicate that exercise makes people “ fat , ” however most research shows * some * weight loss by exercise , but not a lot because the persons are not doing that much exercise in most research . so the true exception is when exercise makes a person fat , not when they lose weight by it . however , most people don ’ t exercise enough to promote weight loss , which is at least an hour a day , so perhaps most people don ’ t lose a lot of weight by exercise , but they could if they did more along with some moderation in their diet . it is easy to bicycle an hour everyday . it is harder to run an hour a day . bicycling is probably one of the best things a person can do for weight loss . read ride your way lean : the ultimate plan for burning fat and getting fit on a bike by selene yeager which mentions dozens of persons who have lost weight by riding their bicycle . you could also google “ scott cutshall ” who lost over 300 pounds by bicycling everyday along with a plant based diet . i am certainly not an exception , but many persons have done the same thing i have done and also lost a lot of weight.i am curious how you came to that conclusion that saturated fats do not influence cholesterol numbers . “ the saturated fatty acids , in contrast to cis mono or polyunsaturated fatty acids , have a unique property in that they suppress the expression of ldl receptors ( spady et al . , 1993 ) . through this action , dietary saturated fatty acids raise serum ldl cholesterol concentrations ( mustad et al . , 1997 ) . ” http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 10490 & page = 432heating the saturated fats was not the reason that the saturated fats caused an inflammatory response , they acted as a pathway for bacterial endotoxins in the link i provided . this is one mechanism for inflammation.also , we do not want our cholesterol high , we want it as low as possible . we have to get our cholesterol numbers low enough , total below 150 and ldl below 70 to achieve “ heart atack proof ” status . thus , having “ normal ” cholesterol means risk of dying a “ normal ” death from heart disease . it is noted in the harvard heart letter that the average total cholesterol for americans is 203 . the author notes that strict vegetarians are able to reach these lower numbers of below total 150 . again , we shouldn ’ t assume that cholesterol numbers are negligible , just that current recommendations for optimum are too high.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19662696from the editor in chief of the american journal of cardiology . “ as shown in figure 1 , most of the risk factors do not in themselves cause atherosclerosis [ heart disease ] … the atherosclerotic risk factors showing that the only factor required to cause atherosclerosis is cholesterol . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3603726 / also , i will not click your links to out there web pages , if you have studies to share then please do.toxins my curiosity got the best of me and i clicked the link . i am not quite sure why this isn ’ t considered spam . he links his own site that sells e-books . and they are all outlandish.this sounds very convincing to me . nf contains lots of videos that show that animal fats cause inflammation in one way or another . on the other hand there is also some videos about sugar causing inflammation ( as far as i remember ) . also i remember reading some stuff that high blood sugar levels cause atherisclerosis by oxidizing ldl ( is that correct ? ) . in the end sugar is the fuel we use eating carbohydrates . if that is true there might still be a point that it is better for your health to burn fat instead of sugar , if you could get it without the inflammation . so does this mean one should ideally fill ones caloric intake with nuts , avocado and cocoa ? pure table sugar can result in some inflammation , but not broken down carbohydrates from fruits and starchy plant foods . most studies do not show a relationship between starches and heart disease , and in fact it is usually favorable in preventing heart disease . on the other hand , white flour , and candy are not considered whole plant foods and are damaging to health.relying on fat for fuel ( ketosis ) results in harmful end products that our body works hard to get rid of . the primary fuel source for humans , and for the most long lived populations , are starches.thank you for your answer . do you have some link where i can read about this effects of ketosis ? also : it would be very interesting to see a nf video about ketosis onced . everyone following this website daily is not really considering eating eggs , meat or dairy anyways ( really too much bad effects ) , so videos about that are not as interesting ( at least for me ) .also another thing about this website . sometimes videos go like this : people eating standard american diet - > you add something- > improvement in biomarkers . personally i think you can add almost anything to the standard american diet , that it isn ’ t toxic and has some nutritional value , and it will improve biomarkers.never saw a video like this : people eating a healthy diet : you add something ( brokkoli , lentils , whatever … ) and it still has an effect.if there is some studies like that – it would be a lot , lot more convincing.big fan of this website still : ) ! i agree completely . the standard american diet is so terrible that adding any food that is healthier will show benefit . a prime example of this is shared by jeff novick , one of the best plant based dietitians out there . “ move over walnuts , kale , goji berrries , sweet potatoes , purple cabbage , etc . , & make room for the next super food : carrots ! “ carrot intake might be inversely associated with prostate cancer risk . ” when you understand that the typical diet consumed today is * * so * * bad , possibly being the worst diet ever consumed by humans in recorded history , then you understand that you can look at a group of those eating this diet and take * any * one healthy ( or healthier ) food ( or food with some healthier aspects to it ) , and look at those who eat more of it compared to those who eat less of it ( or none of it ) and almost always see a difference . but that does not make it into a health food , let alone a super food . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 24519559as you will see , i really like jeff novick , he puts nutrition into perspective and sees right through the bs . here is his comments on when the okinawans , a population that is primarily plant based and have many members living past 100 years of age , they added more greens to their diet to reach recommendations and here is the summary : “ here is the studyhttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19013573dietary intervention with okinawan vegetables increased circulating endothelial progenitor cells in healthy young women . atherosclerosis . 2009 jun ; 204 ( 2 ) : 544-8. doi : 10.1016 / .first , lets look closer at who the subjects were . “ this randomized controlled study employed 45 healthy free- living female volunteers living in okinawa aged between 18 and 38 years . none of them were being treated for any disease at the time of the study . ” so , they were young adult women , apparently free of disease.how many vegetables were they eating on average ? “ according to the national health and nutrition survey in japan , the average vegetable intake of japanese women aged 20 – 29 years was 235.4 g / day . ” that is slightly over 1 / 2 lb . to put this in perspective , here is what 235 grams of “ cooked boiled , drained ” veggies equals based on the usda sr 25235 gram equivalents 1.8 cups kale – 66 calories 1.5 cups broccoli – 82 calories 1.4 cups collards – 84 calories 1.5 cups brussels sprouts – 85 calories 1.3 cups spinach – 54 caloriesso , for convenience sake , lets say on average , the average vegetable intake in japan is about 1.5 cups per day which is about 75 calories.for the record , the national recommendation from the japan ministry of health , labor and welfare for vegetable intake is 350 g / day . the usda recommends 2.5 cups per day for women aged 19-50 ( which is 5 servings ) . so , the average intake is actually less than the minimum recommendations.these numbers are based on their national averages.now let ’ s take a closer look and see how many vegetables the subjects in the study were actually eating before the intervention.the intervention group was consuming 187 grams per day and the control group was consuming 161 grams per day.as you can see , not only is this far short of their own national recommendation of 350 grams per day , these women were consuming even less than the national average of 235 grams per day.now , for the intervention … “ about 371g / day of okinawan vegetables were delivered to the intervention group , but the subjects consumed only 169 g / day of the okinawan vegetables for a total of 356g / day in the dietary intervention group ” “ in contrast , subjects in the control group , who were not supplied okinawan vegetables , consumed only 40 g / day of okinawan vegetables during the intervention period … for a total of 200g / day in the control group . ” so , lets organize this so it is easier to see.intervention group baseline / intervention / total 187 / 169 / 356control group baseline / intervention / total 161 / 40 / 201the difference in the intervention was 129 grams ( 169-40 ) , which is 4.5 ounces and the difference in the total was 155 grams ( 356-201 ) , which is 5.5 ounces . these amounts are the equivalent of about 2 servings.now , lets put this all in perspective … a group that was consuming about half of the recommended amount of vegetables , increased the amount of vegetables they were consuming by about double ( ~ 2 servings ) to the recommended amount and saw a statistically significant improvement.that is exactly what i said above . if we take people who are not eating the recommended amounts and just get them to eat the recommended amounts , we would see a great benefit.in addition , notice , that while the amount they consumed now met the recommended intake of the japan ministry of health , labor and welfare it still fell short of the recommendations of the usda myplate . yet , they still saw a significant benefit.so , let ’ s clarify . if you take subjects who are eating about 1 / 2 the recommended minimum of vegetables and get them to eat the recommended minimum , we see huge benefits . however , this does that mean that someone who is already eating this way and who is already far surpassing the minimum recommended amounts , is going to see any such benefit by including another serving of kale.as i said above … in other words , if americans would just get in the recommended amounts of fruits and veggies , it would not only provide carotenoids , but more than enough of all of them to produce the beneficial health outcomes , including reduced risks of cancer . and anyone following a whole food plant based diet , as recommended here , would already be consuming way more than enough.so , yes , by following the basic principles and guidelines of the program , we are all doing way better than anyone in any of the studies ( and the executive reports are recommending ) and are already erring way on the side of caution.in health jeffps for the record , the vegetables they were given to eat were mostly bitter melon / squash , green papaya , spinach , mustard greens with some dandelion , mugwort and beets . ” https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / forums / viewtopic.php

how-did-we-come-to-believe-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-are-bad-for-usseems the question of what is healthy isn ’ t so clear really . i ’ m questioning the conventional wisdom of high fiber , low fat is healthy . i ’ ve struggled with a low fat diet for decades , and have just started a low carb diet this week . will be interesting to see how it impacts my blood work in 4 months.theyfly out of curiosity where is the struggle ? by low fat you mean 10 % of you calories in fat ? ( i ask that because for some reason 30 % has been labeled as low fat lately ) .the struggle wasn ’ t in reducing my fat intake ( probably in the order of 15 % , 20 % protein and lots of complex carbohydrates ) but keeping myself lean . low fat actually seems to match my food desire – love carbs . the struggle is really that i could never get rid of the extra inch around my belly , even though i do lots of cardio and strength training . i ’ ve been reading and watching information offered by dr attia for a couple months now , and have decided to change directions to see if it helps . i go for a blood test in 4 months and see if it ’ s healthy for me.i hope and expect that reducing my carbs to very low levels will have a health benefit.my new struggle now is finding foods high enough in fat , without increasing my protein levels . it seems unnatural to me still ( only a week ) , but i hope that changes.oh i find the opposite to be true . since going wfpb i have lost 5 pounds . there just aren ’ t a lot of calories in plants . did you lose a lot of weight by chance ? i have patients that keep that little bit of skin / fat after losing and really have a hard time getting rid of that.you obviously don ’ t have a family history of heart disease . that would stop you from experimenting.never really overweight – always in the area of 180 + / - 5 pounds at 5 ’ 10 ” . i ’ ve been very active for the last 30 + years ( sports and high intensity workouts ) so cardio conditioning and muscle tone are good . resting hr of 148 and normal blood pressure – never measured vo2 max . just that one inch of fat that layers my gut that bugs me . i can cut my calories and lose a couple pounds , but then that starvation feeling , especially after a hard workout , will have me consume more carbs then i should and i ’ m back to where i started before you know it.if it proves to be unhealthy , then i ’ ll switch to the eco-atkins as my next experiment : http : / / archinte.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ? articleid = 415074have you ever measured your fat percentage by chance ? i find that helpful and actually those scales are pretty accurate if you do it the same time each day . they are actually really close to the really expensive machines.when you say carbs that is actually kinda problematic because you only get 3 choices . fat , carbohydrates or protein . but we know you can ’ t compare a japanese yam and a cookie . so i like to differential between simple and complex carbs . as an athlete my primary fuel comes from complex carbs and i can ’ t get enough . i don ’ t eat simple carbs.about 15 % depending on the day ( + / - 2 % ) . not sure how accurate the machine was though.only complex carbohydrates , but an occasional treat . for the last year i ’ ve been limiting foods based on their gi , so even some fruits i avoid . no sugared drinks or fruit juice ever . i tried to eat whole grains , beans , lentils and veggies with lean protein including skinless chicken breasts , sardines , egg-whites … since when were sardines ‘ lean ’ ? http : / / ndb.nal.usda.gov / ndb / foods / show / 4544 ? fg = & man = & lfacet = & format = & count = & max = 25 & offset = & sort = & qlookup = sardinesmy mistake . i meant to breakup my food into 3 groups but skipped the 3rd “ healthy fat ” . i eat sardines for some omega-3 and calcium , and also eat salmon for the same reason ( minus the calcium0 . of course both are fatty . my consumption was rare , since i ’ m not a huge fan of the taste.why don ’ t you go to a straight calorie counting method ? i do this and i have had great success in getting my weight down after not being able to for 25 years . i used to be 255 and am now in the low 150 ’ s at 5 11 to 6 0- a weight i have maintained for 4 years now . studies show that low fat and low carb diets with equal calorie deficits produce exactly the same weight loss . donmatesz below linked his website http : / / donmatesz.blogspot.it / which the very first video on the website entitled “ why did i get fat on a low-fat , high-carbohydrate diet ? answered . ” showed that overfeeding persons with carbs or fats at the same calorie level brought the same weight gain . if you track what you eat , weighing and measuring everything you eat , you might find that you are eating more calories than you thought you were . also , counting calories can prevent overcutting calories , which would put a person into starvation mode . when i count calories , i always make sure i eat my allotted calories and not less than them . since you exercise , you shouldn ’ t have to eat so few calories to lose weight . instead of going to eating dead animals , just count the calories you consume from whole plant foods . remember to count everything , including condiments.wish i was that disciplined . even if i managed to count all my calories that precisely , i would then have to account for my various caloric expenditure of my workouts , which aren ’ t totally consistent or repeatable.my other problem is that i tend to lose weight in the wrong areas – when i was on a calorie restricted low-fat diet , i lost weight everywhere but my fat stores on my gut . people even told me i was starting to look unhealthy , and i only lost 4-5 pounds . so how do you accomplish site specific loss ? crunches don ’ t work – get bigger stronger abs , but the fat layer remains . is it just generic ? i suspect that it ’ s carb-sensitivity , since it typically causes fat storage primarily around the belly.i ’ ll do my low-carb diet for 4 months , and if it doesn ’ t work or my blood work suggests that it ’ s unhealthy , then i ’ ll switch back and perhaps try calorie counting.so … you know when you look at those really lean men with no belly fat and a 6 pack ? their body fat is closer to 6-8 . so if you are after that … .. not that that look is necessary i am just letting you know how lean they are.you should watch some of the videos on this website . and read the referenced links.about 15 % + / - 2 percent . not certain how accurate the machine is . i workout 7 days a week , either strength or cardio ( spin class , and high intensity full body cardio ) . i have a watch that estimates calorie expenditure , and for some of my workouts i exceeded 800 cals for 1 hour.i ’ m very conscious of my simple carbohydrate intake – have been limiting foods based on gi for a couple years now . eat a lot of veggies , beans , lentils , whole grains … along with lean protein such as skinless chicken breasts , egg whites … and healthy fats in salmon , sardines … my appetite following a workout is insatiable though . i usually eat , wait a while , then feel that i have to eat more … . maybe it ’ s just me.my goal seem simple enough – lose 1 inch and stay healthy . it ’ s been more goal for a long time.my last blood work was only ok also – doctor even recommended i start taking omega-3 pills to improve my numbers . so i ’ m very curious to see if a highly restrictive carb diet will change that – either way.i am a recent vegan ( april 2014 ) , and have included dr. esselstyn ’ s recommendations of no oil , no nuts . i made this rather drastic dietary change based not on the numerous and conflicting clinical studies , but on his photographs of reversal of heart disease and greatly improved measurements of blood flow . many of you know the nutritional literature much better than i do ( and i too will be following don matesz , interesting site ! ) , so i have a general question . are there any papers out there by those who advocate the atkins plus , paleo diets , or the “ mediterranean ” diet , that show images of reversal of heart disease and increased bloodflow ? eating cholesterol can only increase the ldl / hdl numbers slightly . remember on average there is 10g cholesterol in the blood . there is a study on law school students of their hdl / ldl . their total cholesterol numbers went up significantly during the finals . go figure.but absorption of dietary cholesterol into the bloodstream is not the primary channel by which dietary cholesterol increases serum cholesterol . again , do you follow this topic at all ? have you actually looked at the video and the cited sources ? just looking at the first graph in the video from the hopkins meta-analysis , you see that the first 1000mg of dietary cholesterol seems to average out at about 1mmol / l , or 38.7mg / dl , increase in tc . let ’ s lowball the blood volume of these subjects on average to 4.7 liters ( http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / blood _ volume ) . this means that 1g added dietary cholesterol increases tc by 1.8g or so , so the amount of dietary cholesterol is not directly an upper bound on the increase in serum cholesterol . dietary cholesterol alters cholesterol metabolism in the liver , basically.in the second graph in the video , the error bars are kind of crappy , but looking at the comparison of point estimators , you largely bear out a story that is consistent with the first graph . 400mg extra cholesterol ( 2 yolks ’ worth ) in that study was estimated to increase serum ldl-cholesterol by 20mg / dl or so , or almost 1 gram using the same blood volume as before . dietary cholesterol has a leveraged effect on serum cholesterol , and we can say this especially for diets whose saturated fat content isn ’ t unusually small.i think , if we take hematocrit into account too ( blood is roughly 50 % rbc ’ s by volume ) the serum volume is more like 2.5 liters … .making the 400 mg example align a bit better with the observed serum increase.yeah , it looks like hematocrit cannot be neglected because it ’ s about 50 % as you say , although i ’ m not clear on the extent to which hematocrit takes up cholesterol depending on blood levels : i.e. http : / / jama.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ? articleid = 290866but assuming that such an extra wrinkle is not an issue , it doesn ’ t hugely change the reply as a targeted argument since the figure of 10g cholesterol in the blood is apparently based on a similar extrapolation that is probably neglecting hematocrit . taking tc of 200mg / dl serum as average , you should have 5g total in your plasma . this means that in the first graph the first 1g dietary cholesterol is expected to change tc by a little less than 1g , or 20 % of the expected value for a baseline of 200mg / dl . in the second graph , the 400mg cholesterol in addition to a baseline of 200mg increases fasting ldl by 500mg , or 10 % of the 5g . these are still very nontrivial shifts in percentage terms , especially if we consider that we probably want tc lower than 200 by at least 50 points or so.still , point taken that while we still see diminishing returns as more and more dietary cholesterol is added , the initial increase on total mass of circulating cholesterol for small amounts of dietary cholesterol may not be as great as i initially thought it would be.can you direct us again to the studies that blood cholesterol levels are actually a predictor of heart disease ? many are saying that the latest and best science suggests there is no correlation.here is the 40 year follow up of the 7 countries study , and the results remain constant . the higher the serum cholesterol , the higher the incidence of cvd.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2642008 / other studies have found this toohttp : / / www.nejm.org / doi / full / 10.1056 / nejm199711203372102 # t = articleresultsmany many older studies have found this , and i know of no newer studies disputing the diet-heart hypotheseswhat about this ? http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20071648thanks for sharing , here is a repost on it.this meta-analysis looked at 21 different studies , and came to the conclusion that “ there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of chd or cvd [ heart disease ] . ” shared by jeff novick : one major problem with this study is they did not look at any studies where the saturated fat intake was less than 7 % , which is the level recommended by the american heart association . most of the diets had saturated fat intakes in the range of 10-15 % ( or more ) .so , just like the studies that criticize “ low fat ” diets , but never analyze any diet that is truly low fat and based on the principles of low fat , high fiber , whole plant foods , this study criticizes the impact of lowering saturated fat , but never looked at any diet that truly lowered saturated fat to the level recommended.another problem with the study is what the subjects replaced the saturated fat with when comparing the 2 . for many , if not most , it was with either ( or products containing ) hydrogenated / trans fat , while flour , white sugar and / or mono fats.do you keep track of the different studies ? can you share your data ? i sometimes stumble onto studies like this : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20479151 i was arguing with someone who advocated for grass fed beef consumption . he gives me this article to read : http : / / authoritynutrition.com / top-5-reasons-why-vegan-diets-are-a-terrible-idea / the website you provided in your second link is making baseless claims . most of the answers you are looking for are already available here on this website . i would check out these few particularly fascinating videos series ’ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ? s = igf-1 http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / endotoxemia / ask your friend to present a study linking grass fed beef consumption with low mortality , or doing anything positive at all . advocating for organic meat is like grasping at straws , the issues do not go away.ken , i am very interested in the latest and best science suggesting no correlation . would you please provide those references for me ? thanks.i am going to try and obtain a copy of the article at the library since i don ’ t want to spend $ 36 to read it , but it does discuss egg yolks . i have eliminated meat and almost all dairy from my diet for 4 years , but eggs in the form of egg whites are still on my list for breakfast . i make an omelet with zucchini , onions and mushrooms – hard to beat . we eat a lot of oatmeal and fruits but would find it hard to give up the egg whites . in my reading the yolks contain all the fat and cholesterol of the egg . i would be interested in what others have found in this regard.ray : lots of people ask this same question . dr. barnard says , there are only two problems with eggs : the yolk and the white . to understand some of the problems with egg white , you might want to check out the nutritionfacts series on igf-1 . here is the first video ( just keep clicking “ next video ” until you get to the body building video , the end of the series. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop / and also check out this video on the link between methionine and cancer . darryl points out that egg whites have the most concentration of methionine compared to all other foods. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction / http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / foods-000084000000000000000.html ? categories = 1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22bottom line for me is : egg whites = cancer . and then there are serious issues with contamination that you would get from the white as much as the yolk.happily , your morning breakfast does not have to suffer ! tofu scramble works really well in replacing a morning omelet . you can still include your zucchini , onions and mushrooms . use firm tofu and then the secret ingredient : “ black ” salt . do some research on that stuff and be sure to get the right kind . ( it ’ s not actually black . ) if you do , it will have a sulfur taste and smell that is just like egg whites . when i have people smell a bag of black salt and ask them what it smells like , the vast majority say , “ eggs ” .thea – thank you very much . wow ! — this will lead to a lot of study – how to cook w / o eggs , etc . methionine appears to be high in all types of fish as well as egg whites – another dilemma , since fish is still in my diet ! cooking and eating at home is one thing , but dining out becomes much more complicated without either eggs or fish . thanks for the “ black salt ” note as well.so i ’ m a very busy guy … please let me know if eggs are good or bad for a person who eats a vegan diet most of the time and eats eggs only when craving meat . or you could answer the question this way . are eggs bad for humans in general ? lol .. too busy to watch a video on eggss ? what do you think about this meta-analysis ? http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20071648it ’ s not that eggs are bad , it ’ s the egg yolk . egg whites have no cholesterol , great in protein and are very low in carbs and fat.please see here for details on egg whites and protein. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / protein-intake-and-igf-1-production / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction / unfortunately , this is incorrect . this belief stems from the false idea that high cholesterol is bad . this is not true . many studies have pointed out that people with high cholesterol live longer than those who have low cholesterol . and when testing cholesterol , medics use ldl as the barometer but they must go one step further and test the size of the ldl . if the particle size is large , then that is healthy . if particle size is small then this is where the problem is . cholesterol is a natural part of the human body and the body produces it when there is inflammation . so , in general , if there is too much ldl small particle cholesterol , then we look at why there is inflammation as cholesterol will spike when there is inflammation in the body , which is the source of many diseases , especially heart disease . and our poor diet , high in bad quality fats – vegetable fats such as canola oil ( machinery oil which never should be consumed ) , soy , corn , safflower and hydrogenated fats – these fats create inflammation in the body and lead to a host of illnesses . saturated fats – butter , animal fats , etc … , consumed for millennia , are the healthiest fats , along with coconut and olive oil.if you want to learn more about all of this , watch the documentary : cereal killers . it is great and you can see exactly what happens to someone who goes on a strict high fat diet – eating eggs ! and other high fat foods all the while being tested for cholesterol by doctors . it will totally blow the whole false belief that eggs are bad for you.so there you have it , a drop of information from someone who has had many health problems , went to school to learn how to heal himself and in the process of doing so learned how incorrect much of the dietary information is that is put forth by the medical “ authorities ” and media . best of luck ! what do you make of her high tg levels ? watch at the 6 minute mark and also notice how her doctor ignored mentioning her high tg results. http : / / youtu.be / imr7bp5iuee ? t = 6mvegan with high tgi have been trying for years to convince my colleagues and patients that checking fasting lipids gives a very limited picture of the body ’ s burden of damaging lipids during waking hours . i often found extremely high levels of triglycerides and elevated levels of cholesterol in patients who claimed to have been fasting , but after confronting them with the bad results they confessed that they actually had been eating their regular western diet a few hours before . this usually happened when their appointment was later in the day , making it difficult to fast . once they repeated the test after 8 hours of fasting the results were usually in the normal range . although fasting lipid levels have a place in determining the presence of existing lipid problems , random testing will predict much better the risks patients will have to develop cardiovascular disease . i am aware of only one canadian study that endorses this view . this issue is also explains why so many patients are surprised to have cardiovascular disease , a heart attack or stroke , even though their lipid levels were always in the normal range.eggs are the most nutritious food on the planet . cholesterol is a non issue . what kind of stupid do you have to be , to donate to this ridiculous website ? bacon and eggs , mmmmmm.anyone who ’ s still falling for the notion that plaque in arteries is caused by cholesterol in food is either on the payroll of the statin manufacturers or woefully behind on keeping up with research . hello , the brain is largely made of cholesterol ! sugar is what causes arterial plaque to develop.cholesterol is not the problem . inflammation and arterial damage is the problem. cholesterol is dispatched to fix arterial damage . arterial placque is a symptom of inflammation . as usual big medicine gets it wrong , by looking at and treating symptoms vs. cause.this is just bad science ! cholesterol is not unhealthy , saturated fats ( animal fats ) are not unhealthy . please update your knowledge … our bodies developed to handle a diet high in saturated fats and cholesterol is so important to our bodies that every cell in our bodies can produce it if required . what ’ s causing this obesity and diabetes epidemic is sugar and processed veggie oils . there is so much research out there to support this.it is amazing how the “ dietary cholesterol and saturated fat is good for you ” crowd always comes out of the woodwork to complain when people present the evidence that their fantasies are false . they never have any evidence to support their views of course – just strongly expressed opinions.sadly , reports that us dietary guidelines will change the advice about dietary cholesterol will only encourage such people . all that american egg board money funding “ research ” that shows that people already eating high levels dietary cholesterol do not have their serum cholesterol increased by additional dietary cholesterol , is paying off , it seems . “ serum cholesterol concentration is clearly increased by added dietary cholesterol but the magnitude of predicted change is modulated by baseline dietary cholesterol . the greatest response is expected when baseline dietary cholesterol is near zero , while little , if any , measurable change would be expected once baseline dietary cholesterol was > 400-500 mg / d . ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 55 / 6 / 1060.longdoes anybody know what industry ties the current dgac members have ? love how dr g exposes the tricks of the dietary misinformation industry . who ’ d have guessed fasting cholesterol is so misleading ! dr. greger , this piece has recently appeared in the media : http : / / abcnews.go.com / health / cholesterol-guidelines-foods-back-table / story ? id = 28890189 can you provide a good rebuttal ? i am getting a bit confused with the over availability of information on eggs . i have found this article / research on the bmj ( british medical journal – which should be a valid source of information ) : http : / / www.bmj.com / content / 346 / bmj.e8539this research shows the opposit of what is said here . i would really like to have your feedback on it.good question . yes , bmj is a valid journal . they conclude “ the increased risk of coronary heart disease among diabetic patients and reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with higher egg consumption in subgroup analyses warrant further studies . ” so it seems diabetics eating more eggs were affected by increase risk of stroke and cvd.i do happen to think that heating egg yolk does change the cholesterol in ways that may not be helpful , but this can be avoided by gently steaming eggs just until the whites are done ( 10 minutes ) and the yolk is barley warm . or you can cook an egg sunny side up on a very low heat for about 10 minutes , also cooking the whites and leaving the yolk barley warm , and throwing a few raw eggs in a smoothie hasn ’ t seemed to do any damage . foods also act differently when in contact with different body chemistries . i wonder about any study that suddenly recommends that a food we have been consuming for centuries is suddenly bad for you . i love an organic steak now and then too , whole raw milk and raw organic butter . again , what is good for you can differ from person to person so know yourself . i recommend life extension for buying blood testing protocols that will more accurately measure many of the important markers to indicate your state of health . many docs do not use the best tests , just the cheapest.the above statement feels flawed in its hypothesis . so blood serum levels do come down in the majority of people after consumption of “ cholesterol-laden ” meals such as eggs ? does this not prove the point that temporary spikes are well , temporary ? there is plenty of research that proves that ingestion of cholesterol doe not “ clog the arteries ” ( bad 1980s conventional wisdom ) . also , is there any thought to differentiating between the types of cholesterol here ? what about talking about the fact that egg consumption was shown in a national institutes of health study to only temporarily increase the large particle ldl cholesterol in some people . here ’ s a recent research review that i trust far more than the simplistic nonsense above : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16340654 this article feels to me like folks desperately trying to hang on to an outdated assumption.yeah , facts be damned . it matters not to the “ organic greenie weenie ” bunch that actual medical studies – very very large studies and studies that conglomerate numerous other studies – have shown beyond any reasonable person ’ s doubt that dietary intake of cholesterol has virtually no effect on blood cholesterol levels.my grandfather passed away at age 96 ( due to complications of injuries received in a car accident ) . even at the end , he was stronger than probably 98 % of the people in here fretting about eggs . he ate eggs virtually every day of his life . no heart problems at all.so yeah , lay off the eggs . more protein for the rest of us . american egg board , animal fat , bacon , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cholesterol , eggs , fat , heart disease , heart health , industry influence , ldl cholesterol , meat , pork , saturated fat , sausage , smoking , tobacco , triglycerides the cholesterol in eggs not only worsens the effects of saturated fat , but has a dramatic effect on the level of cholesterol and fat circulating in our bloodstream during the day . doctors are so used to testing fasting cholesterol levels to monitor the effects of drugs , they too often fall for these egg industry tactics hook , line , and sinker . please share this video with anyone who tries to downplay the risks of eggs or dietary cholesterol in general.the smoking study i mentioned can be found here : eggs vs. cigarettes in atherosclerosis.for more videos on eggs for those who just desperately cling to egg industry propaganda , please see a few of my latest : for another jaw-dropper as to the gall of corporate interests to use the veneer of science to downplay the risks of their products , check out bold indeed : beef lowers cholesterol ?
PLAIN-2559	treating hepatitis c with chlorella multiple studies published over the last two decades suggest that exercise can mitigate the deleterious effects of age on immune function , thus increasing anti-cancer immunity , in part by stimulating natural killer cell activity . natural killer cells work to eliminate both tumor cells and virus-infected cells . and we can boost their activity by exercising.here ’ s the difference in natural killer cell activity between women involved in athletic competitions compared to their sedentary counterparts . there is a growing consensus that natural killers appear to be the immune system component that is most responsive to the effects of both acute and chronic exercise across the board , from older women to younger men . significantly higher nk cell activity in racing cyclists in their twenties . even just moderate exercise like daily walking appears to significantly improve nk activity within six weeks . this may be why exercise helps protect against cancer.but sustained , vigorous exercise may actually impair natural killer cell immunity , which may be one reason endurance athletes like marathon runners may appear more likely to get upper respiratory tract infections.in my video on preserving athlete immunity with chlorella , i featured a study that showed that consuming chlorella appeared to prevent the loss in immune function as measured by antibody production in the mouth , but what effect might the green algae have on natural killer cell activity ? petri dish and animal studies suggested that the algae , chlorella , could affect natural killer cell activity , but there was no direct evidence for the effect of chlorella supplementation on such a response in humans , until this randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial gave people about two teaspoons of chlorella a day for eight weeks , and compared to placebo , they got a significant increase in natural killer cell activities.does this actually translate , though , into clinical benefits ? we didn ’ t know until now . the efficacy of chlorella supplementation in adults with chronic hepatitis c infection . it is estimated that up to four million people in the u.s. have chronic hepatitis c virus infection , the leading cause of liver transplants , and estimated to kill a quarter million americans this decade . the current treatment is costly and brutal , costing up to $ 85,000 , and nearly half can ’ t even complete the treatment , due in part to the many complications associated with the treatment . so that ’ s why there ’ s such a need for novel treatment options.after three months of chlorella , there were reported improvements in quality of life , but that could have just been a placebo effect , since the control group wasn ’ t given green sugar pills . this , however , is harder to explain . a significant improvement in alt , which is a marker of liver inflammation , which could be explained by a beneficial immunostimulatory effect of chlorella supplementation.no serious adverse effects were reported , so why not give it a try ? well the brand they used was tied to a disturbing case report recently , chlorella-induced psychosis . a 48-year old woman in omaha suffers a psychotic break , out of the blue two months after starting chlorella . they stopped it and started her on an antipsychotic drug and a week later she was fine.now chlorella has never been linked to psychosis before , so presumably it was just a coincidence that the psychosis started after she started taking chlorella , and the reason she felt better after stopping it was because the drug was kicking in . but seven weeks later , still on the drug , she became psychotic again after starting back on the chlorella . they stopped the chlorella again — this time that ’ s all they did , and the psychosis resolved.now maybe it wasn ’ t the chlorella itself , but some toxic impurity or adulteration , they don 't know . while chlorella is marketed to promote mental health , this case underscores the importance of educating the public about the potential adverse effects and the need for more research in herbal products being marketed in the united states.to see any graphs , charts , graphics , images , and quotes to which dr. greger may be referring , watch the above video . this is just an approximation of the audio contributed by katie schloer . i ’ m not inclined to add chlorella to my shopping list ; it ’ s more of a supplement than something i can pick up at the green grocer . i ’ m more inclined to spend my money on real food than on mail order herbs and supplements . so , following the advice of previous videos on this site , ( look up immune function in the side bar to the left or go to http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / immune-function / ) i make eating mushrooms , blueberries , pepper , and apples along with plenty of fruits and vegetables a part of my daily regimen , along with moderate exercise to boost my immune system.don ’ t forget kale ; ) http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / kale-and-the-immune-system / — and broccoli , green leafy veggies and getting enough sleep.i am with you , i did try it once in my smoothie , but i will stick with my kale , spiniach and swiss chard smoothiesa friend of mine developed psychosis twice during interferon treatment for hep-c . could the psychosis be related to the eradication of the virus from the liver , rather than to the agent of eradication ? has anyone taking chlorella without hep- c developed psychosis ? this is so interesting . and scary.i wonder if dr g would mention chlorella to a patient with hepc . if a patient with hepc was being watched for psychoses maybe it ’ s worth the risk ? i ’ m always glad we can trust dr. g to tell us about the negative side effects associated with different holistic treatments in an evidence based manner.lots of holistic type people come off as crackpots , thanks dr. g ! the part in this video which discusses psychiatric symptoms from chlorella is very interesting to me since my recent discovery about the relationship between parasites and debilitating “ suicidal depression . ” perhaps you too have come across some very interesting news article which describes an alternative medical discovery ( the content of which would steer the reader away from a pharmaceutical “ solution ” ) , and upon reading this article about an herb alternative or food-based medicine , the article suddenly disappears from the internet altogether . i am a self-treated cancer patient and spend about 30 hours / week researching the latest alternative medicine findings as well as the reported ancient plant wisdom , and i can attest to this fact — there must be an army of paid techies whose job description is simply to scrub the internet for any stories which infringe on the pharmaceutical-medical-hospital industrial complex ’ s bottom line profits because i witness this phenomena every day . for example , i recently read ( and then the story disappeared completely ) an article by a reputable medical research center which showed how an overgrowth or longstanding case of parasites in humans is strongly correlated to suicide and / or “ suicidal depression . ” as someone who has lived a long life with depression caused by brain injuries , i need to explain there is a big difference between depression and suicidal depression in both quantity and quality . according to this article , autopsies revealed the entire body of suicide victims was consumed with parasites at a rate much higher than death by any other cause , and the report stated that the medical postulation was that perhaps there is some metabolic byproduct ? of many common parasites which causes this unbearable psychiatric condition leading to suicide . now imagine my surprise in finding this story when i myself , recently experienced this exact scenario – while on a 45-day highly disciplined , top-of-the-line parasite cleanse program i experienced a total disappearance of what i was describing at the time to my closest friends , was a “ suicidal depression . ” this happened in a relatively brief time ( weeks ) during my cancer treatment protocol # 4 ( month 8 ) . this is my long-winded way of saying i think this is also why chlorella causes negative cognitive and mood ( and allergic-type ) symptoms in me too . i have to wonder if it could have something to do with chlorella ’ s questionable identity ( some call it a fungus ) which acts like a fungus in fungus-sensitive people , and also the fact that it is grown in “ fresh water ” which as we know is polluted all over the world and in fact becomes a sponge for pollutants . in other words , i think the days of being able to produce truly clean chlorella might be over and it may also be too close ( botanically-biologically ) to parasites for some people sensitive to psychiatric symptoms ( a group of americans that is apparently increasing in numbers , for various reasons ) . for those of us dealing with advanced immune breakdown , these things matter – circulating information about the alternative medicine choices , as the information comes in and is disseminated through education and sharing , is essential to the survival and quality of life for a large group of distressed bodies . thanks again , dr. greger for focusing on this detail.interesting post … maybe the wayback machine could help you to find the “ disappeared ” papers / post … https : / / archive.org / web / … just search for the site you want to look for … anyway i found your parasite / suicide hypothesis interesting ’ cause parasites could steal particular nutrients from the body and maybe ( it depends on where the parasites are located ) impares organ fuction , or brain areas that need those nutrients … it seems there is some research in the field : http : / / scholar.google.it / scholar ? q = parasites % 2bsuicide + attempts & btng = & hl = it & as _ sdt = 0 % 2c5there ’ s no shortage of articles linking suicidality and toxoplasma gondii infection / antibodies . some speculate altered behavior is part of this parasite ’ s natural cycle in rats & cats.fascinating … maybe before to make use of psycho drugs it ’ s better to check the psyco patient for possible parasitic infection … there seems a consensus that atherosclerosis requires both inflammation ( leading to endothelial dysfunction , ldl oxidation etc . ) , and a surplus of cholesterol building blocks.some useful entries into the literature which i liked , undoubtedly there ’ s better out there : roberts , w. c. ( 2008 ) . the cause of atherosclerosis . nutrition in clinical practice , 23 ( 5 ) , 464-467 . galkina , e. , & ley , k. ( 2009 ) . immune and inflammatory mechanisms of atherosclerosis . annual review of immunology , 27 , 165 . hulsmans , m. , & holvoet , p. ( 2010 ) . the vicious circle between oxidative stress and inflammation in atherosclerosis . journal of cellular and molecular medicine , 14 ( 1 ‐ 2 ) , 70-78 . thanassoulis , g. ( 2013 ) . mendelian randomization : how genetics is pushing the boundaries of epidemiology to identify new causes of heart disease . canadian journal of cardiology , 29 ( 1 ) , 30-36.thanks a lot ! : - ) a mechanistic note of caution . in the lab , chlorella polysaccharides activate toll-like receptors prominent in pathogen pathogen recognition and innate immune response signalling 1 , 2 . tlrs are also active in inflammation , chronic inflammatory diseases like atherosclerosis and diabetes , and autoimmune disorders , and one korean study biopsied cases of autoimmune hepatitis possibly attributable to chlorella 3 . there ’ s a similar story with fungal β-glucans , another food compound that stimulate immune response via tlrs , for both good and ill : 4 , 5 , 6 . there ’ s perhaps a fine and individual balance between adequate and excess immune stimulation.so what your saying is that the algae could help stop the hep-c , but then continue to cause symptoms similar to hep-c itself through its various pathways ? man , it seems like nature just gave with one hand and then took away with the other . at least they still have coffee to fall back on as a helpful natural remedy.if there ’ s is a negative effect from uncontaminated chlorella , its very rare . i ’ m just fascinated with hormesis , of which this may be yet another example , and have also been reading reviews on the tlrs , possible important mediators of negative effects of saturated fats and endotoxins in atherosclerosis , diabetes , arthritis and neurodegeneration.when you first mentioned hormesis i knee-jerked “ wacko ” new age bunk . but youre so sharp on other topics i had to look into it more . it is fascinating . the alcohol j-curve and even low doses of radiation seem to elicit protective effects . i even notice that my seedlings do better when i withhold water , just enough to stress them a little.is it possible that , dare i ask , an occasional bite of animal could activate innate protective systems ? epidemiology trumps benchtop speculations , and studies like tc campbell ’ s china study note “ no evidence of a threshold beyond which further benefits did not accrue with increasing proportions of plant-based foods . ” while hormesis seems established , at present we don ’ t know where we lie on the many curves for different stressors . we ’ ll all ( including vegans ) already have some circulating saturated fats and endotoxins ( from our own metabolism and microbiota ) as well as strange polysaccharides from other biological kingdoms we eat . we don ’ t know whether this places vegans left or right of a possible hormetic dose response peak for the innate immune / inflammation stimulating tlr agonists . and where that peak lies probably differs if we ’ re fighting infection or cancer.there ’ s a much stronger case with all the plant polyphenols ( berries , cruciferous vegs , tea , cocoa , etc ) which activate phase ii responses , where pretty much everyone benefits from more intake from whole foods , and hence we know most of us are starting from left of the peak . yet even here , people manage to push themselves over the peak into the long trough with concentrated green tea extracts and broccoli juicing.i want to share that i know a person that cure the hepatitis c with chamomile tea , that is all what she had to drink , she stay in her room until the infection was gone refused to go to the doctor . she had one cup and one spoon and the tea and warm water . lunch and dinner was rice and beansjust skimming from wikipedia in order to illustrate a cautionary counterpoint : “ the infection resolves spontaneously in 10 – 50 % of cases , which occurs more frequently in individuals who are young and female . ” think critically , people.i searched for the source , could not find it . i do see a website that lists your pasted quote , but this website does not list a source for this quote . please provide the exact source and scientific literature that came up with this observation.say that sort of thing to marjorie . i was making a rhetorical point with wikipedia , a source that includes a lot of readily accessible information on most topics that is reasonably likely to be true , which anyone can very easily use in order to check against potential holes in their reasoning.this sort of accessibility is also what has your reply boggling my mind , and thinking that your request might be sarcastic . but in case you are actually serious , the current english-language wikipidia article for “ hepatitis c ” has the sentence that i am quoting when discussing acute infection . the source that wikipedia is using for that claim is this scholarly book : http : / / www.springer.com / medicine / internal / book / 978-1-4614-1191-8 . and yes , i know that there is unevenness in wikipedia ’ s sources , and that wikipedia is not the most accurate reference on most topics . but that issue was basically irrelevant to the point that i was trying to make.i have been taking chlorella daily for 27 years . i started it to treat herpes … problem put to bed ! everyone asks why i have so much energy and they assume i drink crazy amounts of coffee , but i don ’ t drink any . i attribute my vitality to the chlorella.sounds like you were already very active before you started taking chlorella.i ’ m sorry rose but you handed me that joke on a silver platter . i hope you can share my laugh , and i didn ’ t ruin your day ; ) i ’ d love more info ( videos ) on hep c and alternative treatments.although expensive , there are now fda approved hep c treatments that have virtually no side effects . they are short in duration 12 weeks or less . the current one is gilead ’ s sovaldi . perhaps next year a solvaldi combo will be available without ribavirin . in 95 % or more ! the treatment effected a cure. aging , algae , alternative medicine , animal studies , athletes , cancer , chlorella , complementary medicine , exercise , hepatitis , herbal remedies , immune function , industrial toxins , liver disease , liver health , mental health , psychosis , respiratory infections , side effects , supplements improvements in natural killer cell immune function may explain both the anti-cancer benefits of exercise as well as the apparent anti-virus effects of the green algae chlorella . that psychosis case report makes me nervous . unlike blue-green algae , which can produces neurotoxins ( is blue-green algae good for you ? ) , chlorella does not ( is chlorella good for you ? ) , but neither does spirulina , yet toxins have been found in spirulina supplements , presumably due to contaminants ( another update on spirulina ) .there are other ways to counter the impact of over-strenuous exercise . see : and other ways of boosting natural killer cell activity .
PLAIN-2569	prevent cancer from going on tor over the last decade more than 5,000 papers have been published about tor , an enzyme inhibited by the drug rapamycin , a drug used experimentally to extend lifespan , but already in use clinically to prevent the rejection of kidney transplants . patients , who received rapamycin due to renal transplantation , had a peculiar “ side effect , ” a decrease in cancer incidence . in a set of 15 patients who had biopsy proven kaposi ’ s sarcoma , a cancer that often affects the skin . within three months after starting rapamycin therapy , all cutaneous kaposi ’ s sarcoma lesions had disappeared in all patients.this makes sense , given that tor functions as a master regulator of cellular growth and proliferation . for example tor is upregulated in nearly 100 % of advanced human prostate cancers . maybe that ’ s why dairy consumption has been found to be a major dietary risk factor . we used to think it was just all the hormones in milk , but maybe prostate cancer initiation and progression is also promoted by cow ’ s milk stimulation of tor . our understanding of mammalian milk has changed from a “ simple food ” to a species-specific endocrine signaling system , which activates tor , promotes cell growth and proliferation and suppresses our body ’ s internal housecleaning mechanisms . now normally , milk-mediated tor stimulation is restricted only to infancy where we really need that constant signal to our cells to grow and divide.from an evolutionary perspective it can be concluded that the persistent “ abuse ” of the growth-promoting signaling system of bovine milk by drinking milk over our entire life span maintains the most important hallmark of cancer biology , sustained proliferative signaling.tor appears to play a role in breast cancer too . higher tor expression has been noted in breast cancer tumors , and associated with more aggressive disease , and lower survival rate among breast cancer patients.this could explain when women hospitalized for anorexia may end up with only half the risk of breast cancer . severe caloric restriction in humans may confer protection from invasive breast cancer by suppressing tor activation . but we don ’ t have to starve ourselves to suppress tor , just reducing animal protein intake can attenuate overall tor activity . moreover , diets emphasizing plants , especially cruciferous vegetables , not only decrease tor activation but they provide natural plant-derived inhibitors of tor in broccoli , and green tea and soy , and turmeric , and grapes , along with other fruits and vegetables such as onions , strawberries , blueberries , mangoes and the skin of cucumbers , maybe that ’ s why plant-based are associated with lower risk for many cancers , the downregulation of tor . are we finally on the threshold of being able to fundamentally alter human aging and age-related disease ? only time will tell , but if the pace and direction of recent progress are any indication , the next 5,000 studies on tor should prove very interesting indeed.to see any graphs , charts , graphics , images , and quotes to which dr. greger may be referring , watch the above video . this is just an approximation of the audio contributed by katie schloer . got tor ?

so , what are the leading preventable causes of death for people who eat whole food plant based diets ? they live longer , but i ’ m curious as to what does eventually cause death among them ? i read that they suffer much less long-term illness and more often die of catastrophic injury or illnesses such as influenza , pneumonia , etc.that people who eat whole food plant based diets should die more often from influenza and pneumonia makes no sense . people who die from influenza and pneumonia typically have a chronic condition such as heart disease , diabetes , rheumatic disease , which a wfpd prevents , and a wfpd is typically lower in calories ( and maybe have cr mimetic properties ) , which probably reduce the decline in immunefunction as you age.you appear to be missing the context . people die of something eventually . what do vegans die of ? unlike methionine , plant proteins in general and animal proteins in general do not differ all that much in % leucine content . for example , as far as leucine as % of total protein goes , egg protein has 8.5 % , milk protein 9.7 % , and beef protein 7.9 % , while soy protein has 7.6 % , pumpkin seeds about 8.4 % , and rice protein 8.3 % ( i did some calculations using the tables in bowes & church ) . i know dr. greger wants to push the plant based diet , but eating plant based protein will profide about the same amount of leucine as eating he same amount of animal based protein . it looks to me that if one wants to reduce leucine intake , one would need to eat less protein , period . … and an effective way to do that would be to eat plant-based.1 cup rice with chicken breast : 500 cal , 58 g protein , 4.4 g leucine 1 cup rice with 1 cup beans : 460 cal , 19 g protein , 1.6 g leucineunless people on a non-vegan diet restrict their food intake overall , or are in fact limiting their meat consumption ( i.e. making their diet closer to a plant-based one ) , they will most likely consume excessive amounts of protein and subsequently of leucine . an advertisement for a plant-based diet in the context of this subject appears quite reasonable to me.i am wondering about something mentioned in this video . i had anorexia nervosa for many years in my 30 ’ s ( i am now in my 40 ’ s and still have struggles ) -i guess that may offer me some protection ( which would be the only good thing that came from that illness ) . now that i am trying to fully recover , i am being encouraged to eat low fat dairy yougurt – it seems like this is not a good thing based on the video . i normally mix it with fruit and hemp seeds – what should i be doing instead . i apologize for my ignorance as i am new to all of this.maybe try mixing those good items in soy yogurt ? hi gigi , could you share why you were being encouraged to consume yogurt ? if it ’ s an issue of calcium , you can easily get more than enough calcium from plant foods , particularly beans and green vegetables , and even seemingly “ low ” calcium plant foods like fruits , whole grains , etc all add up over the course of the day . add in a serving or two of fortified non-dairy milks , tofu , etc , and your levels will quickly skyrocket above the recommended intake . if the idea of supplements bothers you , keep in mind the calcium in most dairy products comes from a supplement given to the cows in their feed.if it ’ s a matter of protein , know that it ’ s mathematically impossible to consume less than your rda for protein on a whole foods plant based diet , provided your caloric intake is sufficient . on my simple diet of vegetables , fruits , whole grains , and legumes , i consistently consume no less than 150 % of the recommended amount for my weight.of course if you enjoy your yogurt habit , you can very easily switch to any non-dairy yogurt . if you find it cost prohibitive ( it ’ s quite expensive where i live ) , you can make your own for much less , either with a cheap yogurt maker ( ~ $ 20 ) , a crockpot , or a pressure cooker.you don ’ t need dairy for the calcium , if that ’ s why your eating the yogurt , but i would make sure to include kale every day as one of your vegetables , as it has a good amount of absorbable calcium as well as vitamin k. you could also take a calcium supplement , but you don ’ t really need more than about 800 mg of calcium per day ; the body can ’ t absorb more than about 500 mg at a time anyway . you should also get at least half as much magnesium as calcium.with anorexia nervosa , you have to worry about osteoporosis , caused by lack of estrogen from amenorrhea due to low body fat ( less than 16 % ) , and also by insufficient weight bearing on your bones . so make sure to get enough weight bearing exercise as well as enough vitamin d and vitamin k.you also need to keep your diet sufficiently alkaline by including plenty of fruits and vegetables and enough protein ( from beans and grains ) to help rebuild and maintain bone density . if necessary , i would also include a potassium bicarbonate supplement ( “ potassium basics ” which can be purchased online ) to ensure that your urinary ph remains at 7 or higher . otherwise , your body will take calcium from your bones to raise the ph . you can purchase ph test strips online to determine your urinary ph . if it ’ s lower than 7 to 7.25 , i would take the potassium bicarbonate to raise itin order to ensure that you get enough calories , you could also include high calorie foods like avocados and nuts.hope this helps.gigi : re : “ … it seems like this is not a good thing based on the video . ” i agree . in fact there are a large number of videos on this site which indicate that dairy is not a good thing.i think b00mer was right on when she said that you would want to find out * why * they recommended yogurt . that will help you figure out a more healthy alternative.i am not an expert , so i have no idea why they would have made that recommendation . but in addition to what b00mer suggested , i was thinking that maybe they were looking for food that would have a high calorie density . in that case , you could try to figure out the calorie density of the yogurt you eat and find comparable whole plant foods to eat instead . just an idea.if you find out the “ why ” , let us know and we maybe this group can make some helpful , specific suggestions.i know how overwhelming good nutrition can seem at first . i can promise that it does get easier over time as you absorb the information and learn what does and does not work for you in terms of taste , convenience , etc . good luck to you.question for dr. greger . this video and many others note the importance of the cancer fighting abilities of cruciferous vegetables as well as tea ( no doubt matcha and hibiscus are at the top of the list ) . however a simple google search of “ pesticide + tea ” brings up many concerning and properly sourced news feeds , of all things , the carcinogenic properties of pesticides still on the packaged tea. not to mention if we simply steep the tea or ingesting it whole as per your practice at home ) . is there enough data out there to provide the context if this is a real threat ? does the tea cancel out the negative health effect of the pesticides ? those products claiming to be organic tea at a premium price ; do we get our money ’ s worth ? for those of us who consume the tea whole ( as you mentioned is a common practice with your family ) , should we be more worried ingesting more of the less water soluble pesticides with the whole tea ? my question is … if we have cholesterol screening available to give us information about our heart health why don ’ t we have any tests for our cancer health ? many of the videos discuss dropping blood on cancer cells and seeing them either multiply or die . why aren ’ t there tests that people could get that would tell them … we dropped your blood on some liver cancer cells ( or breast or prostate etc … ) and they grew or they died so things look ok . if things don ’ t look good then they can suggest dietary changes and test again ? why are we not using this ? is it due to cost ? hi andy , yes in vitro work is incredibly expensive , and as someone with experience in mamallian cell culture i personally would not want this to become widespread practice . the time and expertise / training , cell lines themselves , growth media , sera , enzymatic and other solutions for processing cells and all the plastic bottles they come in , all the single-use disposable plastic pipets , flasks , slides , vials , gloves , booties , the maintenance of labs and all the equipment within , etc , that are necessary to do one simple assay are perhaps justified in performing representative and informative studies , but i think it would be quite wasteful to perform as testing for individuals . i think the public would be much better served by advocacy that exposes them to the information we already have . combined with all the other in vitro work , as well as epidemiological , clinical and interventional research that has already been done , we have quite a consensus already as far as which foods cure and which foods cause cancer . just my two cents.another thing to keep in mind , as many people who eat a plant based diet either come to it through ethical reasons , or come to care about the ethics of animal consumption as a result of dietary changes – in vitro mammalian cell culture nearly always uses fetal bovine serum . and yes , it is as awful as it sounds . though synthetic sera have come on the market and are objectively superior in terms of consistency of composition and sterility , in the scientific world , changes in methodology come slowly.does this apply to leucine in soymilk and almonds ? valid question ! no , the plant-based proteins ( even those higher in leucine ) don ’ t seem to be connected to tor in a negative way.oh , this is such a relief ! i hoped that was the case because i love my non-gmo , organic soy ! since beans are the plant food with the highest methionine content , should they not be eaten too much ? good question , dogulas . it seems to only be a concern with the animal-based proteins / amino acids.very informative but this does concern me . as someone who has taken up a fitness regime , i take bcaas ( not certified vegan ) as part of my supplementation . as we know leucine is crucial in activating the mtor pathway for protein synthesis but … it appears also harmful in large amounts leading to cancer ? this seems like a weird irony to me since traditionally more muscle mass is favored and associated with less cancer risk . is there an optimal amount of leucine that should be taken by those working out to build muscle ? i have recently made the switch from whey / casein protein to brown / pea protein ( but event these do contain high levels of leucine ) . i am very health conscious and currently am making my transition from lacto-vegetarianism to veganism . many thanks doc , your reviews are cementing my allegiance to plant based diets.hm the video seems to only adress tor as a cancer growth stimulator . wouldn ’ t plant based amino acids also boost tor if consumed in large quantities ? from an athlete ’ s perspective : can i boost muscle growth without boosting cancer growth risk ? eating more fruits on the day increases my old acne , any link between fruit en tor ? aging , animal protein , blueberries , breast cancer , broccoli , caloric restriction , cancer , cruciferous vegetables , cucumbers , dairy , endocrine disruptors , fruit , grapes , green tea , hormones , infants , kaposi ’ s sarcoma , kidney health , lifespan , longevity , mango , milk , mortality , onions , plant-based diets , prostate cancer , rapamycin , soy , spices , strawberries , tor , turmeric , vegetables suppressing the engine-of-aging enzyme tor ( target of rapamycin ) by reducing intake of leucine – rich animal products such as milk may reduce cancer risk . what is tor ?

PLAIN-2579	alzheimer ’ s disease : grain brain or meathead ? the rates of dementia differ greatly around the world , from the lowest rates in africa , india , and south asia , to the highest rates in western europe and especially north america . is it all just genetics ? well the incidence of dementia and alzheimer ’ s disease is significantly lower for africans in nigeria than for african americans in indianapolis , for example . up to five times lower.alzheimer ’ s rates of japanese-americans living in the u.s. are closer to that of americans than to japanese . so when people of one ethnic group move from their homeland to the united states , alzheimer ’ s rates can increase dramatically . therefore , when africans or asians live in the united states and adopt a western diet , their increase in alzheimer ’ s risk suggests that it ’ s not the genetics.unfortunately one doesn ’ t have to move to the west to adopt a western diet . the prevalence of dementia in japan has shot up over the last few decades . mechanisms to explain this in japan include increases in cholesterol , saturated fat , and iron from increases in the consumption of animal products . traditional diets generally are weighted toward vegetable products such as grains and away from animal products , but since 1960 , the diet in japan has changed from a more traditional rice-based diet to one with a preponderance of meat.from 1961 to 2008 , meat and animal fat increased considerably , whereas the rice supply dropped.the dietary factor most strongly associated with the rise in alzheimer ’ s disease in japan was the increased consumption of animal fat.a similar analysis in china arrived at the same conclusion . on the basis of these findings , the rate of alzheimer ’ s disease and dementia will continue to rise unless dietary patterns change to those with less reliance on animal products.this is consistent with data showing those who eat vegetarian appear two to three times less likely to become demented , and the longer one eats meat-free , the lower the associated risk of dementia.globally , the lowest validated rates of alzheimer ’ s in the world are rural india , where they eat low meat , high grain , high bean , high carb diets . now it ’ s possible that the apparent protective association between rice and alzheimer ’ s is more likely due to the fact that the drop of rice consumption was accompanied by a rise in meat consumption , but other population studies have found that dietary grains appear strongly protective in relation to alzheimer ’ s disease . in other words , perhaps , don ’ t pass on the grain … pass the grain , to spare the brain . the entire topic of nutrition and cognitive wellbeing is fascinating . as i get more knowledgeable and informed in nutrition it seems the inter-related domains of nourishment , consumption patterns , and behavioral satiety are all potential villains and heroes in various nutrition related dynamics , health and pathology . both physiologically and behaviorally the brain plays such a central role in these . great video ! much more along these lines at plantpositive.com where the most thorough science-based review ever of the high meat , high fat diet is analyzed – starting from their own references . you owe it to yourself to check it out no matter where you are now . cheers.could high-fat vegan sources be creating more dementia as well ? as of late i ’ m a bit concerned that too much nuts and avocados and plant fats like that , when one goes overboard ( which is easy to do , as these plant-fats taste great ) could contain the same detrimental properties as the meat-based fats . maybe not as bad , bud still bad . i ’ d like to see some research on this , so maybe you could do so , since most of us here are vegan already , i think.a number of studies have linked saturated fats and trans-fats with alzheimer ’ s ( particularly in apoe ε4 carriers ) , while finding negative associations with monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats . there are some plants high in saturated fats ( eg coconut and palm oils , macadamia nuts ) , but for the most part the mufas and pufas predominate among plants . not the most recent review , but this article sums the research through 2010 in a readable fashion.avocados are 76.6 % lipids . the omega 6 : 3 ratio of avocados is greater than 15 : 1 which is not good.the ratio of omega 6-3 is high but of no consequence . one cup of raw avocado has only .19 grams of omega-3 . that is decimal point one nine . hopefully darryl is aware of that.this video shows how the “ grain brain ” low carb theory is just a bunch of nonsense . i know people who say they feel better after eliminating grains , but when i question them on how much whole grain they actually ate before eliminating the grain , it was very little . they ate mostly processed grain products . when you do introduce whole grains to your diet , it should be slowly so your digestive system can adjust to the fiber … .. then no problem , actually digestive problems are quickly eliminated . i do understand grain sensitivity as i have celiac disease , but that is only a few grains . i eat lots of rice , quinoa , corn , etc . when you look at other cultures and how their health deteriorates when they stray from their traditional diet for the sad , it is all very crystal clear ! once again both sides have it wrong and it is never ever that simple . everi cannot eat grains . but i can eat the pseudo-grains quinoa and buckwheat . grains per se are not the problem.for me ( and for a lot of other people whether they know it or not ) it is the mold in the grains that is the problem . corn is especially moldy . do a search on the internet . the way grains are stored long term allows them to grow hidden mold . by the time i gave up all grains , they all smelled and tasted like mold to me and the reactions were horrific . and i cannot eat wild rice or rice for the same reason . both are grown in watery patties and my reactions are horrific to them . and of course refined grains and refined anything is not good for anyone.another problem with some grains is the gluten . some people can eat totally gluten-free grains but not gluten grains . and this problem has come about from antibiotics as one cause that is worth looking into . wheat especially has been altered to contain more amino acids and more gluten. http : / / www.celiac.com / articles / 695 / 1 / does-candida-albicans-trigger-the-onset-of-celiac-disease / page1.htmli do not believe in either totally vegan diets nor totally carb free diets . although most veggies have plenty of low-glycemic carbs , white potatoes , sweat potatoes , and starchy root veggies can give me such severe reactions i can almost wind up in a hospital if i am not careful . these are very high in starch but what sets me off is the mold.i frequent both lists and both sides , including this blog by dr. gregor , have some good information , but both sides also are so stuck in their belief systems that they are prevented from seeing any big nutrition picture.biochemical individuality is truly the key . so called double blind studies are only true for the participants for the most part . as the course i took in functional medicine at the institute for functional medicine put it , there are many problems with randomized control trials ; the trials are tailored for drug testing , not clinical care and some factors that frequently limit the external validity of rcts include : where the trial was performed . characteristics of the patients under study . study procedures often don ’ t approximate the real world . use of shifting or clinically insignificant outcome measures . statistical manipulation . conflicts of interest in funding.and most of all rcts neglect the individualized nature of heath. and tell us nothing about how to create individualized , patient centered therapeutic plan that will work for a patient with their unique combination of existing conditions , genetic influences , environmental factors , and lifestyle choices.and all of this goes double and triple for studies concerning nutrition . including epidemialogical studies . what works for one person or group of people or culture may not work for the next person due to each persons unique individual biochemistry . also many traditional cultural diets are not always that nutritionally complete . many are , but many are not , and the nutritional deficiencies can be seen in the people that eat them.some people do very well on almost totally vegetarian diets , others , like me don ’ t do so well , although my diet is pretty full of plants . some times i see what vegans eat and my plate is piled much higher in vegetables than many vegans . some vegan might be better labeled starchetarian rather than vegetarian . and vegan diets can indeed be very low or non existent in many critical nutrients . b12 and zinc come to mind immediately but there are others . this is probably the first time in history people can thrive on totally vegan diets because we now have b12 supplements.dr. terry wahls followed a vegan diet for decades and came down with ms. the only way she got herself into remission and functioning again , ( she was in a tilt-back wheel chair towards the end there ) was to go towards the paleo end of the stick , although her diet does vary somewhatobviously a vegan diet was not best for her . for others , such a diet may not work . again , biochemical individuality is key . one thing does not change , however . whatever diet is chosen must be based on real whole foods and not processed depleted , junk , and refined foods and food stuffs.it is simply not true that zinc cannot be obtained from plant sources , or that it is very low in any plant source . here is the section on zinc from the world ’ s healthiest foods http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = nutrient & dbid = 115 this lists plant foods that contain close to 1 / 4 the daily recommended amount of zinc per serving.sesame seeds pumpkin seeds lentils garbanzo beans cashews quinoawheat germ is also an excellent source . oats are also good . and remember that animals do not make b12 . b12 is made by bacteria , so one does not have to eat animals to get b12- just the right kind of bacteria . i even learned that taurine can be sourced from certain kinds of algae . no animals have to be eaten to get any nutrient in a natural , non synthetic way.we will just have to agree to disagree on this one , daniel.health effects of vegan diets “ eliminating all animal products from the diet increases the risk of certain nutritional deficiencies . micronutrients of special concern for the vegan include vitamins b-12 and d , calcium , and long-chain n – 3 ( omega-3 ) fatty acids . unless vegans regularly consume foods that are fortified with these nutrients , appropriate supplements should be consumed . in some cases , iron and zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals . ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 89 / 5 / 1627s.fullplant foods said to contain b12 actually contain b12 analogs called cobamides that block the intake of , and increase the need for , true b12 . “ pseudovitamin b ( 12 ) is the predominant cobamide of an algal health food , spirulina tablets . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 10552882plant foods that contain zinc also contain phytate , which inhibits zinc absorption . bioavailability of iron , zinc , and other trace minerals from vegetarian diets : http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 78 / 3 / 633s.longdr greger recently addressed the phytate argument which was found to be incorrect . and b12 was probably more available in nature before we started “ managing ” agriculture , but regardless , i would rather eat meat free and take a few supplements than try to get some measly amount of some things from meat . are you saying zinc comes from animal products , aside from organs ( organs which are very polluted and in some cases toxic ) ? and meat eaters don ’ t score optimally high on b12 either . to point out the problem with plants but not how injected , infected , and diseased animals are isn ’ t a fair comparison.i ’ m trying to eat optimally for the times in which i live , not some other time . for me , that means organic vegan and a few supplements.i also don ’ t see how drug trial methodology is relevant to the studies dr g presents . many , if not most of the studies he references are conducted on large , sometimes thousands of people , or based on meta analyses . and when you start to see global trends , it actually does mean something . yes people are individual and may react different than the whole , but it to follow you logic why do the studies to begin with ? i tried paleo for a year and reasearched it to the hilt . all it got me was declining health : a 100 point rise in cholesterol , rise in blood pressure , bad digestive problems and constipation . and i was eating free-range , grass-fed , blah blah blah . i ’ ve tried both sides and i know what works for me and these studies overall , have only improved my health.i did not say plants contain b12 . i said that b12 was not produced by animals . this is what wikipedia stated in its article about b12 , ” neither fungi , plants , nor animals are capable of producing vitamin b12 . only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis , although many foods are a natural source of b12 because of bacterial symbiosis . the vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis . ” maybe a person would have to “ supplement ” to get it , but it is “ naturally ” produced by bacteria fermentation . it is not produced by animals . at least it can be obtained without it being synthetic . but a person could get it from a food that was fermented by the right strain of bacteria . this is what wikipedia stated about long chain dha in its article about algae , “ some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long-chain , essential omega-3 fatty acids , docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) . fish oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids , but the original source is algae ( microalgae in particular ) , which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain . ” so in other words , fish do not make dha , they derive it from algae , just like animals don ’ t make b12 , but derive it from bacteria . i consume nutritional yeast , which is fortified with b12 , but this is derived naturally from a bacterial cutture and not made synthetically . the yeast itself is from a culture as well.eating an all animal diet would result in far more nutritional deficiencies than would a diet sourced from plants , bacteria , fungi and algal sources . an all animal diet would have no fiber , very little vitamin c and would be lacking in many phytochemicals and anti oxidants.being a meat eater increases the risk of more deficiencies than eating plant based , including magnesium , potassium , folate , copper , vitamins c , e and k , and other problems including losses of calcium due to too much sulfur , and high cholesterol . yet you never see studies warning of the dire consequence of being a meat eater and not eating foods “ fortified with these nutrients ” ( as though these are special substances not found in normal foods ) .vitamin b12 is found in lake and river water in much larger amounts than is found in meat ( livestock fodder is fortified with b12 and other things anyway ) , but fresh water today is polluted , and tap water is chlorinated , which destroys b12 ( chlorine also affects b12 levels in the body in a round about way by displacing iodine , which is needed for the production of a thyroid hormone involved in the methylation process ) . pernicious anaemia was only discovered after water chlorination began in the late 19th century in england.posting a study about an exotic fresh water algae only shows that this specific rarely-consumed substance contains b12 analogues . these cobamides may in theory bind with b12 receptors , there is no proof that it actually happens . but even if they did the existence of this rarely-eaten supplemental food is not enough to allege that vegans consume more cobamides and therefore all vegans are at risk of health problems.38 % of meat eaters have lower-than-desirable levels of b12 , this increases to 75 % in elderly people . 9 % of meat eaters have an outright deficiency . only 0.1 % of b12 is actually absorbed from red meat – you ’ d have to eat about 100kg of it to get your rda . to act like this is a vegan problem is disingenuous . the same is true of vitamin d – one study in america showed that 100 % of non-white people had a deficiency . over 70 % of people in the uk are thought to be deficient . it is only feasible to get about 10 % of the rda of vitamin d from diet , so to allege that vegans are somehow more at risk is false . vitamin d is manufactured by the skin after being exposed to sunlight . modern indoor lifestyles cause vitamin d deficiencies . if anything vegans would be less at risk since we are more aware . also , we are the only group that has an average weight within the healthy level – all other groups are overweight . overweight and obese people need more vitamin d because it is fat soluble and is diluted in excess fat cells.the media likes to promote a very specific animal food as the source of a certain nutrient , then baselessly accuse vegans being “ at risk ” of deficiencies . the notion that meat eaters will fare better with omega 3 ’ s is based on the idea that they all eat certain types of oily fish on a regular basis , which they do not , and that they don ’ t consume enormous amounts of omega 6 fats , which they do . on the other hand , vegans consume omega 3 rich ground flaxseed frequently as it is used as a binder instead of eggs . also , most plant foods contain some amount of omega 3 and it accumulates . most fruit , vegetables , nuts seeds , and grains have some omega 3 . however , excellent omega 3 sources are found in ordinary foods in the plant world – just 5 grams of flaxseed will provide over 100 % of the rda ( if you ’ re american , one ounce = 28 grams ) , as will 3 walnuts , or 15 grams of hemp seeds . among vegetables , most leaves provide about 15 % of the rda per 100 grams , and onions , leeks and bell peppers are also high . among fruit , a bowl of raspberries ( 300g ) will provide 33 % of the rda . other berries are almost as good . soya beans and it ’ s curd ( tofu ) are very high in omega 3 ’ s , as are other beans , although not as high as soya since soya is very fatty . i ’ d hazard a bet that vegans fare better than average on omega 3 ’ s.it ’ s worth remembering that certain fish are only high in omega 3 due to consuming algaes , or consume other fish that consume algae . algal omega 3 supplements are superior to fish based supplements . grass-fed meat has slightly higher levels than fodder fed animals , because grass and other leafy greens provide omega 3 ’ s ! calcium is another example of the livestock industry equating a specific animal-based food with “ getting enough ” of a certain nutrient , then claiming vegans may be “ at risk ” of deficiency to scare people into buying more of it . in this example , the dairy mafia promotes cow ’ s milk as high-calcium and absolutely essential for human health . this is despite the facts that : ( 1 ) no other animal eats milk past infancy ( 2 ) let alone the milk of another species ( 3 ) humans have only been consuming milk for the past 5000 years – where did they “ get their calcium ” before that ? ( 4 ) 2 / 3 of the world did not consume cows milk at all until the past couple of decades , and ( 5 ) significant swathes of the world ’ s population still do not consume dairy.promoting milk as high calcium and therefore essential for bones and teeth is an easy sell , since dairy products are generally whitish and so are bones and teeth . most people don ’ t even realise that calcium is a grey shiny metal like any other . yet dairy products remove more calcium than they provide , since the body has to neutralise the excess sulfur with its own calcium . countries with the highest dairy consumption also have the highest rates of osteoporosis.there are many plant-based sources of calcium that are higher than dairy products , without also causing calcium losses . unlike animal foods , these foods also contain nutrients that are essential for utilising calcium . it is worth remembering that vegans need less calcium ( 600mg vs 1000mg a day ) because not eating animal products mean we lose less . unlike meat eaters , we get adequate magnesium , potassium , and silica , which are essential for bone and dental health . silica can actually replace calcium in some areas.plant sources of calcium include sesame seeds and tahini , poppy seeds ( which are ridiculously high ) , soya beans , many other beans , peanuts and other nuts , amaranth , wholewheat and other grains , oranges , dates , figs , kiwis , winter squashes , dark sugars ( such as molasses and muscavado ) , dark green vegetables ( especially kale , rocket and purslane ) and sea vegetables . again , like omega 3 ’ s , all plant foods contain some amount of calcium – not only does this accumulate effortlessly , but it is easy to boost calcium above and beyond what you need in a day by consuming some of these common nutritious foods.the allegation that vegans “ may be at risk of deficiency ” of omega 3 and calcium is based on the two products that are promoted in the media as “ good sources ” happen to not be vegan . on the other hand , the allegation that vegans need to worry about iron is simply a lie . vegans have the highest iron intake of any group , and unlike meat eaters we consume enough folate and vitamin c to utilise it . vegetarians are 40 % less likely to suffer from iron deficient anaemia than meat eaters . only 40 % of the iron found in meat is this haem iron that they think is so easily absorbed , yet this specific type of iron is toxic and is thought to be a cause of bowel cancer . a reduction in accumulated haem iron is thought to be the reason why donating blood has health benefits.zinc is bound with phytate in nuts , grains and beans but not in fruit and vegetables . another poster has pointed out the potential benefits of phytic acid , but it can be reduced if desired by simply soaking the seeds.finally , your comment that you think vegans only manage to survive because b12 tablets now exist is ignorant . ( 1 ) vegans have always existed , and our numbers include leonardo da vinci and st david of wales , a tribe who have been vegan for their 2000 year existence , a group from a chilean mining village who charles darwin commented on positively for their strength , and an ancient 5000 year old european body that isotope tests showed to have eaten a plant-based diet ( 2 ) it is only very recently that people have begun to eat so much meat . until the last century this indulgent lifestyle was reserved for rich people . in the past , including in europe , average people only consumed meat a couple of times a year . many people round the world lived this way until as little as 20 years ago – the china study was an excellent example of this ( 3 ) vegans from developing countries without chlorinated water do not get b12 deficiencies . also wild herbivorous animals do not get b12 deficiencies bu develop them when taken into captivity ( 4 ) many people round the world are still almost vegan due to not being able to afford the excessive meat intakes of westerners.most parent ala omega 3 ’ s do not convert well to epa and dha . only a tiny portion is converted . also , i completely disagree with your diatribe on b12 . comparing veganism to the sad diet is totally meaningless . b12 deficiencies exists for a variety of reasons , including the fact that intrinsic factor declines with age . however vegans are particularly at risk . read “ could it be b12 ? ” the standard american diet is good for no one and it surprises me not that most americans are deficient in a variety of vitamins and minerals . the sad contains lots of refined grains , sugar , junk food and is largely devoid of fruits and veggies.the amount of vegans i have seen totally ndestroy their health is overwhelming . perhaps even more overwhelming than those on the sad diet , as i often see vegans making the same mistakes as every other unhealthy eater but with even more restrictions and limitations , refined grains , sugar , beans , and processed soy making up the bulk of the diet . yukbut i do wish you luck with your vegan diet ! note , if a vegan wishes , he / she can supplement with vegan dha / epa , which is a more sustainable source of both than fish . honestly though , from reading the above it just seems to me there is simply no arguing with some people- they are so filled with preconceived notions of what constitutes optimal eating patterns for humans ( and interestingly are more often than not usually proponents of the raw milk / paleo pov as they are easily recognised by their tendency to dwell on the biased scaremongering that has been proposed around phytic acid , soy , wheat , and promotion of saturated fat etc . ) that no amount of reason , explanation or scientific evidence from those who eat and who have gone to the trouble to research plant based diets will convince them that there does in fact exist a different way of achieving good nutrition . for some reason , they flat out refuse to believe that a well planned vegan diet can be just as healthy as a well planned omnivore diet . instead , they seem to focus time and time again how vegans are at risk from various nutrient deficiencies ( and seemingly ignoring time and time again the non-animal sources they can- and are- obtained from ) yet whilst constantly glossing over the fact that they are also at risk of deficiencies ( as well as over consumption of some vitamins , minerals , protein ) . to boot , those who try to negate vegan diets also seem to gloss over the fact that people who consume animal products still get some of their nutrients ( iodine and vitamin d , but to name a few ) from ingesting fortified foods ( largely milk ) but yet somehow , invoke this need to ingest fortified food , say , for b12 or zinc as a vegan , as a major red flag for the safety of this diet . indeed , it ’ s not only odd , but is a glaring double standard and one that they seem all too happy to ignore ( indeed , my own sister regularly pops a multivitamin to offset her meat rich diet and yet i ’ ve never read one post attempting to negate the health benefits of a mainstream diet simply because of the need to take this multivitamin . interestingly , instead of being invoked to show how detrimental a meat heavy diet can be , using a multivitamin is regarded as common sense . its hypocrisy at its finest ) . indeed , i also find it very convenient how some sceptics tend to go so far as to invoke their own experiences of seeing half dead vegans to bolster their argument , when in reality vegans make up a very small portion of the worldwide population . indeed , in my 31 years on this planet , and despite being a town-city dweller , i ’ ve only ever met one vegetarian and have yet to meet a fellow vegan . consequently , i believe this to be a vain grasp at straws , or put simply , a poor claim to try and disprove a diet that has been repeatedly held by the likes of the uk nhs and others as being perfectly healthy for all ages groups once planned properly . and as for any claim that a vegan diet is worse than a standard diet filled with junk because its too restrictive and of itself filled with processed crap ? well , in my eyes , this kind of kind of personal opinion should be regarded as not only a sign of a deep seeded bias , but so misinformed , uncreative and unfounded as to what range of fruits , nuts , vegetables , seeds and grains that vegans do eat ( i honestly don ’ t understand why this is such a hard thing to grasp ? ) that is should be regarded as deeply embarrassing to anyone who claims such a thing . not only is not worthy of a decent rebuttal , but perhaps evidence that we might be better off just accepting rather than attempting to discredit a strangers decision as to what to eat / not to eat.when you have several diplomas and degrees in nutrition , then we can have this discussion on a more knowledgeable level . you do what is best for you . and no i am not a paleo promoter.not vegan ! from terry wahl ’ s website : “ when i became a medical student , i lived on beans , rice , whole-grain bread , eggs , cheese , pasta , potatoes , vegetables , and fruit . i believed that fat and protein were necessary for my high-energy lifestyle . my multiple sclerosis symptoms began during medical school , long before my diagnosis , but i ignored them . ” maybe it was the dairy and eggs that she also cut out : “ eventually , i developed the wahls diet , focusing on 9 cups of fruits and vegetables : 3 cups of leafy greens , 3 cups brightly colored fruits and vegetables , and 3 cups of sulfur-rich vegetables . my diet also includes sea vegetables and organ meats . ” she ’ s also selling a book . doesn ’ t she know that organ meats are toxic ? i wonder what ’ s up with mcdougall ’ s ms study . tax meat ! “ she ’ s also selling a book . doesn ’ t she know that organ meats are toxic ? ” organ meats are one of the few dietary sources of coq10 . her diet now does in fact contain proteins from meat and organ meats although not in large amounts . a couple of times a week . ( paleo people tend to eat way too much protein ) the eggs and dairy are eliminated precisely because so many people have severe food sensitivities to them that are fueling their autoimmune illnesses . eggs are still allowed for those with no sensitivity to them , as well as rice and other non-gluten grains.i stand by most of my statements on this list . dr. gregor has an agenda too . he promotes only those studies which meet his view of things . and i see this same issue on pale sites . you can find just as many studies that show that pale diets , gaps diet etc work for this or that . but dr. gregor never shows you those studies because he is biased toward vegan diets , or at least vegetarian ones.in the end both sides are just as bloody biased . as someone who has actually studied nutrition i get flack and attacks on both lists , and i just brush it off.nutrition is much more complicated than either side wants to admit.i do not see any one physician as a nutrition expert . medical schools don ’ t teach nutrition . physicians have to learn it on their own . and when they get stuck in an agenda , thinking what works for them is going to work for everyone else , they badly mislead their followers . this goes for physicians pushing pale diets as well , including dr. wahls.these doctors are like the blind men and the elephant . each thinks the whole of nutrition is only the piece that they believe in and that worked for them.you can find many bloggers who went on vegan and vegetarian diets who ruined their health on them and had to stop . same with pale bloggers.again , biochemical individuality is the key.what i meant was that perhaps stopping eggs and dairy is what cured her.no. i have her book . ( among the hundreds of others i have ) . from my perspective it is possible she might have a methylation defect and thus her vegetarian diet was not the right one for her , or her many previous food sensitivities were interfering with the methyl cycle or both and more . ( she had to give up all grains and dairy as well as eggs and pseudo grains . ) dr. wahls is now a functional medicine physician so she finally is learning the type of nutritional biochemistry that she did not get in medical school . and she admits in her book that medical school did not teach her anything at a all about nutrition , gene defects , and all that , and she had to take courses at the institute of functional medicine and also do hours and hours of research online.this woman took herself from being just about hopeless in a tilt back wheel chair to a functioning physician again , and people will still want to argue that the diet that turned her back into a functioning physician again is some how an unhealthy diet . it is the right diet for her.tax meat ? why should we enrich the government and punish the citizens for their meat choices ? education is a better solution than punishment , please.the government could use that money to promote sustainable energy , etc . at least remove the subsidies for corn etc . over 50 % of greenhouse gases come from meat industry. http : / / www.worldwatch.org / files / pdf / livestock % 20and % 20climate % 20change.pdfeducation isn ’ t cutting it when people want to stay ignorant and billions are spent to keep them that way ! the first step is of course to amend the constitution to say that corporations are not people , my friend.i have to disagree with you about dr. terry wahls . she followed a vegetarian diet not a vegan diet : “ when i became a medical student , i lived on beans , rice , whole-grain bread , eggs , cheese , pasta , potatoes , vegetables , and fruit . i believed that fat and protein were necessary for my high-energy lifestyle . my multiple sclerosis symptoms began during medical school , long before my diagnosis , but i ignored them . ” the healthy fats are broken down efficiently unlike the animal fats.i wonder about the reference to rural india . do rural indians live long enough ? the average age of death in india is lower than in western countries and as a rule rural indians die at a younger age than urban indians due to lack of health services.average life span in rural india is 65.9 years ; symptoms of dementia can start appearing in late 30 ’ s early 40 ’ s.i ’ ve heard theories that the large consumption of turmeric in india is responsible for their low incidence of dementia.and yet dr. perlmutter author of grain brain and practicing neurologist completely disagrees . he deals with alzheimer ’ s patients daily and has found in his practice that low carbs / high fat works for his patients . so how does the average person decide what ’ s really best ? did he try eliminating / only / processed grains from their diets ? did he have the patients eat whole grains instead ? it ’ s easier to sell books when you ’ re able to point fingers and vilify something.here ’ s a key exchange between hamblin ( who speaks first ) and perlmutter : i asked for some clarity on that . “ we don ’ t have clinical studies linking gluten to alzheimer ’ s , adhd , or — ” “ with all due respect , we do . that information is well established . it was actually published by the mayo clinic , that gluten can in fact be related to risk for dementia . so i would beg to differ with you on that point . gluten , certainly in patients with celiac disease , is strongly associated with risk for dementia . as was described in the proceedings of the mayo clinic , it was a treatable cause of dementia . so i think that ’ s pretty revolutionary and exciting . ” that study didn ’ t appear in my inbox . i asked him for it later , and he promptly sent me a 2006 case series that identified 13 patients in a review of mayo clinic records from january 1 , 1970 , to december 31 , 2005 . that is an interesting correlation — the study ’ s authors called it a “ possible association ” — but is far from well-established causation that gluten is a mechanism for dementia in people with celiac disease , much less all people.got that ? under perlmutter ’ s prism , a single study , of 13 people , with a finding of “ possible association , ” turns into a near certainty.i wonder if perlmutter ’ s book cite any other “ significant ” studies , if at all ? a recent post from perlmutter cited a mayo study implicating a high carb diet in dementia , with a high fat diet being protective.see http : / / www.drperlmutter.com / dietary-fat-brain / ? utm _ source = email & utm _ medium = newsletter & utm _ content = fat % 20 % 26 % 20brain % 20video & utm _ campaign = hygiene & utm _ source = newsletter + signup & utm _ campaign = e4de1438c3-hygiene7 _ 1 _ 2014 & utm _ medium = email & utm _ term = 0 _ e07b6602c1-e4de1438c3-86950229 & mc _ cid = e4de1438c3 & mc _ eid = bd4f294a23i really wish dr geiger and dr perlmutter would agree to a dialogue so we can sort out the relative merits of their apparently diametrically opposed take on fat , carbs , meat , and brain healthin all fairness , the group with the “ high carb ” was eating close to twice the amount of sugar … not grains , not legumes , sugar.anyone who heard radio debates between dr. dean ornish and dr atkins knows how this one goes . it ’ s the same arguments , same story , same findings , and i ’ m still a plant based , whole-food vegan . you can see similar stuff on youtube between gary taubes and ornish . ( around the time that the movie “ the sixth sense ” was popular , ornish would joke : i see dead people ; they ’ re on the atkins diet.excellent , as always ! thank you . some things seem so obvious , but then again , your programming from youth , parents , siblings , wife et.al. talks to you and makes you question what you know to be right . it is a constant challenge with each and every bite . it this what i most need at this time ? have i consumed too much of “ this ” / or too little ? it is wonderful to talk about a whole food plant based diet . but that doesn ’ t tell me what to eat and when , really . as i say : “ we are each an experiment of one . ” / so we have to think and plan accordingly / and listen to this great and wonderful vessel god has entrusted us with . like “ toxic hunger ” … .say addiction to peanut butter … or any particularly desirable food / one must learn to savor the flavor without consuming it too frequently or in too great of amounts.freedom : we relish and celebrate it at this time of year ! ! ! as well we should / ” we ” have fought so hard to get it and to maintain it . but , as we know , freedom is not “ free ” . it requires our investment in knowledge and rigorous application of that knowledge for our benefit and the benefit of our fellow citizens . invest – in your brain / and reap the dividends again and again and again.happy fourth ! ! ! ! ! ! ! i have two questions for you.is it safe to eat seaweed because of fukushima ? i would love to eat it but i am to worried that it is no longer safe to eat.can vegans have cholesterol that is to low ? my doctor was very worried . i had been vegan for 5 months at the time of this test and here are my numbers : cholesterol 123 , triglycerides 47 , hdl 40 , ldl 74 , chol / hdl ratio 3.08 . his response to what should i do about this was “ can ’ t you just eat some eggs ” . i ignored his advice because i know better than to eat that . i am still vegan but i am concerned because my doctor is concerned.if seaweed is no longer safe to eat i would think that green tea would also be affected . i would love to know your thoughts.check out the aluminum content in green tea. also fluoride content. maybe not so good ! ? has your doctor read the latest study by dr. esselstyn which showed actual reversal of heart disease . dr. esselstyn restricts fats to less than 10 % of daily caloric intake , and he wants his patients to have cholesterol levels below 150 , preferably lower . the only 2 prior studies showing actual reversal of heart disease , by ornish and esselstyn , were done on the same plant-based very low fat diet . populations around the world with low incidence of coronary artery disease have cholesterol levels like yours . my doctor is ignorant of nutrition – he asked me how i got my protein.for heart disease and for ischemic ( clotting ) strokes , lower cholesterol ( esp ldl ) seems to always confer lower risk . hemorrhagic strokes may be another matter . the concern around cholesterol below the reference range ( < 140 mg / dl ) largely stems from some studies showing an association with depression , anxiety and attempted suicide . causality was never established , but there are theories about cholesterol and serotonin receptors.i suspect if cindy feels pretty content , doesn ’ t have an eating disorder ( no , veganism doesn ’ t count ) , and isn ’ t elderly ( where low cholesterol can be a marker of decline ) , there isn ’ t much reason to worry about her numbers ( which i ’ m frankly envious of ) .for someone with very low cholesterol , and who is concerned about issues relating to anxiety and depression , is there a way for a vegan to raise his or her cholesterol without resorting to eating animal products , yet at the same time maintaining a “ healthy vegan diet ” ? it is my understanding that the body makes its own cholesterol , but is there a way we can intervene and do things ( such as fasting , eating certain vegan foods , eliminating other vegan foods , etc . ) that might ramp up the bodies production of ch . ? i wish i had this problem . i have been plant-based , whole foods for two years and still struggle to get my cholesterol within the safe range so the doc stops pushing statins . i did learn that cholesterol is used in the process of vitamin d through sun exposure . i had been taking hrt and avoiding all sun – fully covered head to toe and not going out from 10 – 2 – miserable existence . this year i am getting about 15 minutes of unprotected sun a day for natural vitamin d to avoid taking supplements . i am hoping this will use some of the cholesterol my body makes . it is confusing to have my body make so much more than it apparently needs . my argument to my doctor is my body is making it and i ’ m not fighting my body by ingesting synthetic chemicals.brenda : re : “ this year i am getting about 15 minutes of unprotected sun a day for natural vitamin d to avoid taking supplements . ” > > > i thought you might be interested in dr. greger ’ s sun recommendations that are based on where you live and time of day . just scroll down to the vitamin d section : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / re : ” i have been plant-based , whole foods for two years and still struggle to get my cholesterol within the safe range … ” > > > i remember hearing someone ( i * think * it was esselstyn , but might have been mcdougall or someone else ) try to address this problem which seems to affect some people the way it has you . the theory ( and it was just presented as a theory , not something tested / proven ) was that for some people , after years of too much dietary cholesterol , their bodies just keep producing and producing like a broken factory . that was the gist of the idea.the question becomes , how do you fix that factory ? i ’ m not a doctor , but i have some thoughts . there are several videos on this site which highlight certain whole plant foods which are known to specifically help lower cholesterol . i don ’ t have a list off the top of my head , but you can search on this site and maybe tweak your diet to especially include these foods . maybe that would help you.also , you might want to check out esselstyn ’ s book , prevent and reverse heart disease , because he covers all angles of what might damage your endothelial cells . i bring this to your attention for two reasons : 1 ) you mention you are plant based , but do not give details . you can consume oils and still be plant-based . but oils are reportedly bad for the endothelial cells . 2 ) cholesterol numbers are just numbers . you don ’ t care about that really . what you care about is not having a heart attack or stroke . cholesterol numbers are risk indicators , but the bottom line is to stay healthy . so , the point 1 ) above is really an important issue . maybe ( i don ’ t know , this is just a thought ! ! ! ) higher cholesterol is not an issue for you as long as you do everything esselstyn recommends for having healthy endothelial cells . just a thought.also , i have my own personal theory ( that is totally lay-person – not based on any particularly advanced perspective / knowledge of biology and may be completely 100 % wrong ) that people who switch to whole plant foods and start to loose weight may have more cholesterol running through their blood – but that will eventually lower when they finish losing weight . i have no idea what your weight situation is . i just thought i would throw out my theory in case you find it helpful.re : “ my argument to my doctor is … ” > > > not being an expert , i can ’ t say whether or not it is wise to avoid the drugs , but i can say that i totally agree with you . if someone tried to encourage me to take statins , i doubt i would do it . the side effects are not acceptable and i know i can treat the problem with diet . so , why not.having said that , i thought i would let you know that i believe that both esselstyn and mcdougall do prescribe statins for some patients initially along with diet recommendations just to be agressive in treating a potential heart problem . but the ultimate goal is to get their patients off the drugs and i understand that they are very successful in doing so.best of luck to you . i hope this was helpful.thea – thank you very much . i read dr. esselstyn ’ s book two years ago . i dropped 50 pounds which has remained stable for over a year – bmi is 19 . i actually got to talk to dr. e on the phone – at the time i was not doing all he advised . i ’ ve been two years without oil and i eat a lot of raw greens every single day . i know dr. greger has said barley and pinto beans – both have been added to my diet over six months now . i was on seven medications , now down to one . i stopped the statins due to muscle pain . my sun exposure is based on dr. greger ’ s recommendations . i ’ m in the north . i understand my body needs to recover from all the bad eating habits and even the medications . i think dr. e ’ s study showed results after three years so i have six months to go . i did drop my triglycerides from 600s to half – so i am heading in the right direction . doctor says now he won ’ t test my cholesterol because the reason for testing is to treat and i refuse to take statins . it makes him nervous because i did have an mi in my mid 30s.i forgot to mention that i also discovered i had an infection in my system , which i understand can raise ldl . i have a lot of quirks to my medical history so i know it is mainly trial and error for me to find out what works . the body is amazing and i ’ m trying to get mine to the point of healing itself as much as possible.brenda : wow . you are amazing . you have come so , so far . i ’ m wishing you all the luck in the world.thank you . i really appreciate all the suggestions . i ’ m still trying to figure out if there is anything else i can change to improve.brenda : you may want to check out this nutrtionfacts article on amla : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2012 / 01 / 17 / amla-indian-gooseberries-versus-cancer-diabetes-and-cholesterol / the article not only references amla , but dried apples . something else that you might use in your tweaking.good luck ! i did buy amla powder and was using it prior to my last blood tests but haven ’ t been using it recently – though i did find dried golden berries . i eat whole apples – two a day – do you think dehydrating them adds something that eating them “ raw ” doesn ’ t ? i ’ ll watch the video again – sometimes i think i ’ ve memorized most of them . : ) i think someone made a comment about amla powder being consumed on an empty stomach – i was mixing it with turmeric and non fat soy milk like a mini shake.brenda : re : ” do you think dehydrating them adds something that eating them “ raw ” doesn ’ t ? ” i have absolutely no clue . at a complete guess , i would say that rather than a chemical change that makes a difference , the dry apples are simply more concentrated – you can eat more because the water has been removed . if that ’ s the issue , then whole apples would be just fine . my goodness , two hole apples sounds pretty good to me ! but i really don ’ t know . for all i know , the experiment was with dried apples because those are easier to fake for a control group . maybe … ? exercise ! ! ! in grain brain , dr perlmutter says cholesterol is important for healthy brain.yes and i agree with that . i don ’ t want it down to some unreasonable level , just to where the doctor will stop making excuses why i have to take statins . my total is 220 , i ’ d be happy with it under 200 , preferably under 150 ; hdl is 37 but i believe recent studies say higher isn ’ t better . my ldl is 121 , i ’ d like it under 100 , triglycerides are 310 and need to be at least under 150 but since they were at 600 they are improved . since i ’ m two years plant based , whole foods it is all what my body is making not dietary . i wasn ’ t touching any nuts at all per dr. e ’ s recommendations but i just started , especially walnuts to see if that helps.elsie , a number of studies have pointed to deficiencies in hdl cholesterol in depression , which is fortunate as this is generally considered the “ good ” kind of cholesterol : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5.some lifestyle and diet changes that increase hdl cholesterol include aerobic exercise , weight loss , smoking cessation , moderate alcohol consumption , monounsaturated fats , long-chain omega-3s ( eg algal epa / dha ) , soluble fiber , and cranberry juice . several of these have improved the course of depression in clinical studies , though their mechanism ( via hdl or otherwise ) isn ’ t clear.for seriously low hdl which is a marker of cardiovascular risk , doctors have prescribed high dose nicotinic acid ( niacin , a vitamin b3 ) or fibrates ( fenofibrate , bezafibrate , gemfibrozil ) . however , it ’ s not so clear this has cardiovascular benefits.darryl : i know you were replying to eslie , but i wanted to thank you for this reply . i found it very interesting and helpful ! coconut oil and butter . red palm oil.maybe i ’ ll try the red palm oil ( i never have had it before ) , but butter is very inflammatory for me … .body pain and dermatitis .i meant coconut butter.cindy : re : “ can vegans have cholesterol that is to low ? ” i think darryl ’ s reply is helpful . you might also check out this video from nutritionfacts : “ can cholesterol be too low ? ” : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-cholesterol-be-too-low / hi cindy , as far as seaweed and fukushima … .this video of dr. greger ’ s references a chart from a study in 2009 ( before the accident ) that shows dietary sources of polonium and seaweed is on the pie chart around 2 : 50 seconds. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / fukushima-and-radioactivity-in-seafood / a quick search of pubmed also pulled up a list of papers of which some of them are post-fukushima studies that may be relevant to your question : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed ? term = seaweed + fukushima & cmd = detailssearchcindy , my total cholesterol is 97 . my plant based doc is thrilled and happy . my crp is also 0.5 . he told me i ’ m basically heart attack proof.a few years my cholesterol has been 121 and then 117 . my doctors and nurses have always patted me on the back and told me to keep it up . i read once that ray kurzwell , futurist , tech genius and life extension enthusiast has a cholesterol of well below 100 . so , i wouldn ’ t be worried just yet about trying to get your cholesterol back up . i ’ d be just doing more of the same , although , you might look into the balance between hdl and ldl . i ’ m not a doctor nor a nutritionist , but i think eating eggs likely won ’ t change your ratio , just make you numbers higher.buy seaweed by maine coast sea vegetables.many of the ecological associations are also consistent with george brewer ’ s inorganic copper theory , covered in a past nutritionfacts video and taken up by other researchers . few in africa or rural india have copper plumbing . on the other hand , japan uses stainless steel plumbing , so their increase in ad prevalence from 1 to 7 % of > 65 year olds is due to something else . brewer himself suspects copper and high dietary fat interact , as supported by this study.interesting though that there are some nuts that are sky high in copper , as well as saturated fat . maybe this being a reason too many nuts is not so good . and a high-fat vegan diet often has way more copper than zinc . way more.brewer ’ s argument is that inorganic copper ( eg from plumbing , contamination , or copper salts in mineral supplements ) , unlike organically bound copper from foods , bypasses the liver and enters circulation unregulated , as free ions . there have been a couple studies that indicate serum free copper is predictive of cognitive decline , while total copper isn ’ t ( 1 , 2 ) .there ’ s not much work on nuts and cognitive decline , but this study indicated a protective effect , as did this one ( though only with walnuts ) .don ’ t forget that phytic acid has the strongest binding affinity to copper among all metal ions ( cu2 + > zn2 + > ni2 + > co2 + > mn2 + > fe3 + > ca2 ; see this review ) . hence the phytic acid present in nuts and seeds may naturally protect against their relatively high levels of copper . phytic acid may also explain the strong negative correlation between ( whole ) grain consumption and rated of dementia . the paleo advocates engaging in scaremongering about phytic acid may be demonizing a highly beneficial nutrient , which would ironically be most urgently needed within the context of a paleo diet high in iron and copper from animal sources.regarding “ pass the grain to spare the brain ” being protective against alzheimer ’ s and regarding meat and animal food fed # gmo compared to paleo organic grass fed meat causative : both of these foods categories high glycemic starchy carbs and animal proteins are foods that must be limited , meal by meal , each time we eat a meal if you are not vegan . greens are different we can eat unlimited amounts of greens and blood sugar stays great the more we eat ! bet ? both grainbrain and meathead in excess on a chronic basis after every meal when consumption makes hyperinsulinemia this causes alzheimer ’ s . are there studies on portion sizes and quality of grains sparing the brain ? do the studies comparing # gmo fed animal food and organic pasture raised meat causing alzheimer ’ s adjust for achlorhydria and anemia and homocysteine ? if the supposed mechanism for alzheimer ’ s is the “ increases in cholesterol , saturated fat , and iron ” , what makes you think pasture raised meat would be any different ? are they void of those components ? and these studies go back to the 1960 ’ s , linking animal fats to dementia , whereas gmo feed has only been available since the mid 90 ’ s , so it ’ s a leap to suggest that ’ s what the problem is.meat is meat is meat . we see time and time again that it makes little difference where the meat comes from how how it ’ s raised , when compared to not eating it at all . “ are there studies on portion sizes and quality of grains sparing the brain ? ” i believe those questions are answered already in the source studies . the more meat the higher the incidence , the more grains , the lower.if you have any studies showing protective effects of grass fed , organic , pasture , happy meat , then please provide it.thanks for reminding me about cholesterol , sat fat and iron. http : / / www.drperlmutter.com / study / relative-intake-macronutrients-impacts-risk-mild-cognitive-impairment-dementia . appropriate adequate portions of whole organic non # gmo grains is beneficial ok . i think not organic and # gmo wheat is deathly and can ’ t be tolerated not any amount . too much carbs is addressed in this study . i am emailing this whole disqus to @ davidperlmutter he knows all the studies.2 : 10 … it ’ s right about here he does this thing , where he takes this study that seems to say too much animal fat can feedback positively into cancer rates which will go up , and then extrapolates as if it is part of the same study saying that this is consistent with studies that show vegetarians are two to three times less likely to to become demented … then his reasoning he basically draws a straight-line connection between the two studies.this is not warranted – it is not science – it is playing with studies.now … he may be right … but there is as yet nothing to prove that . it ’ s basically saying , isn ’ t this interesting , implying to the vegetarian crowd they are better than “ regular people ” because they are much less likely to become demented.in other words this kind of playing with words can affect people ’ s behaviors because of unproven subconscious connections that the listener failed to or did not want to think about and qualify.i really like dr. gregors web page because i hear about a lot of very interesting studies that i otherwise would not , but i wish he would either do less of this , or mention it when he does it , or qualify in some way some of these statements.we do not know , and in fact as a layperson anyway i think there is plenty of doubt that the relationship between eating meat and some diseases is non-linear and a result of could be implanted bad behavior because of the way we manufacture , treat , and sell and consume food these days – i.e. just too much with too many chemicals.the conclusions drawn need to be really careful i think.greger aint pushing animal rights issues down your throat is he ? do you see him dead bent on selling you stuff ? seems to me the only motivation here remaining must be to try to get people to eat themselves towards healthier lives.he and his team have saved my life as i can attest and for that i ’ ll be eternally gratefull . if only i could get my mother to make the changes so she will be able to enjoy her grandchildren for as long as possible.i ’ m pretty sure there are thousands of people still visiting here with similar stories.you comment is unclear . at 2 : 10 in the video , greger mentions the study on adventists , which looks at how dementia may be linked to animal product consumption . what is the relevance of your comment regarding cancer : greger “ 2 : 10 … it ’ s right about here he does this thing , where he takes this study that seems to say too much animal fat can feedback positively into cancer rates which will go up . . . . ” ? we have to choose the right path for ourselves based on the evidence , and the blue zones with high whole grain , mostly plant based diets are healthier and longer lived than all populations with high meat / dairy intake . those people are slimmer too – guess 1.7 billion asians didn ’ t read the book that tells us rice will make us fat . since i went plant based whole grain , i ’ ve reversed arthritis , osteoporosis , lowered my blood pressure and cholesterol , aortic plaque just disappeared . i ’ m getting healthier eating like this.kudos to you joann ! what bothers me is the number of americans who are suffering needlessly due to the food they eat ( or don ’ t eat ! ) regarding one of the blue zones – okinawa prefecture . as with all vegan vs. paleo topics there is a controversy : ( results from one of the studies : 1 . nutrient intakes in 94 japanese centenarians investigated between 1972 and 1973 showed a higher proportion of animal protein to total proteins than in contemporary average japanese . 2 . high intakes of milk and fats and oils had favorable effects on 10-year ( 1976-1986 ) survivorship in 422 urban residents aged 69-71 . the survivors revealed a longitudinal increase in intakes of animal foods such as eggs , milk , fish and meat over the 10 years . 3 . nutrient intakes were compared between a sample from okinawa prefecture where life expectancies at birth and 65 were the longest in japan , and a sample from akita prefecture where the life expectancies were much shorter . intakes of ca , fe , vitamins a , b1 , b2 , c , and the proportion of energy from proteins and fats were significantly higher in the former than in the latter . intakes of carbohydrates and nacl were lower.nutr health . 1992 ; 8 ( 2-3 ) : 165-75 . nutrition for the japanese elderly. http : / /

/ www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11426289dr greger , the studies that you mention are all about rice being protective for brain health . there is a big difference between rice and gluten grains . it is gluten – not grains per se- that has been linked with dementia.gluten … not grains per se … … which is why perlmutter entitled his book , grain brain , right ? that is incorrect . not all the studies referenced are about rice . from what i could tell , only the two studies regarding japanese reference rice . the study dealing with northern india dealt with grains ( including rice ) and legumes.also , what are the links to scientific studies showing that gluten is linked to dementia ? there are none , it ’ s a myth that gluten has any connection to dementia.saw this one , though it ’ s more related to celiac disease and dementia : http : / / archneur.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ? articleid = 792544thanks . yes , from what i know , the gluten craze is a myth – subsequently turned into marketing bonanza by the food industry – based on the very small percentage of the population that suffer from celiac disease and gluten sensitivity ( which may lead to irritable bowel syndrome , for example ) . http : / / www.biomedcentral.com / 1741-7015 / 12 / 86 i asked lara to provide the studies on which she is basing her blanket statement that gluten is linked to dementia when , based on what i have seen , gluten may be linked to dementia in the small number of people suffering from celiac disease . but even this link seems to be a tentative one : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19018335when i heard perlmutter on his pbs show i heard him say gluten and grains and carbs over and over . he never said just gluten.just stumbled upon this little study : alterations in mood after changing to a low-fat diet . in short , they tracked persons on a 41 % fat diet ( controls on the average fat consumption in the uk at the time ) and a 25 % fat diet for several months.the results : hostility and anger increased significantly among the low fat dieters , and depressed mood decreased among the 41 % fat dieters while it increased among the low fat dieters . tension and anxiety also increased among the low fat dieters.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9505799 br j nutr . 1998 jan ; 79 ( 1 ) : 23-30.why should we care about this one study ? was it well-designed ? does it have statistical power ? does it do a good job of isolating this one factor , dietary fat ? is it of direct concern to us , who want to compare diets without processed food in them ? i don ’ t see what this has to do with this discussion . dr greger isn ’ t against fat , he ’ s against saturated fat . and i agree with @ largelytrue.yes , but he is in favor of high carbs , and recently more and more studies demonstrate that people eating greater amounts of carbs have a higher risk-level of dementia and alzheimer . don ’ t get me wrong , i ’ m on whole-plant based diet myself , and after reading such studies i ’ m just worried that 70 % of my diet is carbs ( though mostly gluten-free ) .you don ’ t appear to be doing any synthesis , though , and in that sense you are amplifying the problematic aspects of these short videos in your own work . if you are simply selecting a bunch of studies for abstracts and conclusions that sorta-kinda imply some sort of harm to high carbohydrate diets of some sort , you aren ’ t doing much.gregor is not strictly high carb , by the way . he ’ s been generally permissive about nuts , and tolerant about whole coconut , though he apparently doesn ’ t favor avocados.no , i ’ m not doing any synthesis , i ’ m just a worried patient with neurological problems on my second month of whole plant based vegan diet , and i ’ m getting worse : ( and my citations of conflicting articles are an expression of my hopelessness that every study dr. greger shows us has a study showing opposite results – just saw a few studies on how low cholesterol is related to depression , dementia , ad , ms and other psychiatric and neurologic issues . and i ’ m pretty much cutting down my cholesterol with the wp veg diet … but you ’ re certain that you are best off going to eat some coconut oil , as per your other comment ? you don ’ t seem hopeless or confused there . your general pattern of peppering single studies on several videos seems rather like you are campaigning to deliver the truth to the site.sorry if it seemed so . as i said , i am totally confused regarding the proper diet , after reading a practicing psychiatrist ’ s blog ( http : / / evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com ) . the posts are all based on scientific articles , just as dr. greger ’ s . the bottom line ( based on quite a few studies linked in her blogs ) – in order to preserve your mental health and nervous system you must avoid grains ( especially wheat ) and legumes , eat plenty of meat , get plenty of saturated fat ( animal based ) and be careful to not get you cholesterol too low since it results in dementia and alzheimer ’ s . anecdotally , there is a mentioning of great vegan gurus like herbert shelton developing parkinson ’ s . all this is opposite to what nutritionfacts.org is suggesting to do and what i ’ ve been doing for more than two months now … oh , and for example studies have shown that broccoli , so much praised by dr. greger promotes severe dna damage in the colon and can be related to colon cancer ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16441953 ) .my point is – sadly it seems that dr. greger picks and presents only studies which support his plant based diet and completely ignores opposing studies and views.that ’ s an extreme view , since he certainly does introduce challenges to his ideas as a part of developing his argument , and frankly his main format is not well-structured to give a high depth of argumentation about his overall position re vegan diets ; 5 minute videos are not 5 page blogs or dissertation-level work.i may take a look at the shrink blog but i ’ ll tell you my prior perception right now : 1 ) psychiatry is even more rife with pseudoscientific speculation than bodily medicine . marketing is perhaps a big part of this . 2 ) evolutionary psychiatry smells of paleo faddism and the naturalistic fallacy in general . our evolutionary past was not idyllic and functional in service of our own existential happiness . it was good enough to get us to cling , sometimes foolishly , to any chance to pass on our genes , as much as that tendancy could be inscribed by incremental changes in an imperfect genome.you are absolutely right , except maybe the marketing thing : ) after my half a year communication with different psychiatrists i especially agree on the psych being a pseudoscience . and the blog i referred to also definitely smells of paleo – which is not surprising since the blogger is a paleo apologist herself . however , the studies which are cited on the blog and the whole approach is not that much based on the evolutionary past . and since the neuro-psycho issues for me are naturally the most important , possible positive effects of animal ( saturated ) fat , taurine , carnitine , creatine , cholesterol and other substances ( which i eliminated from my diet ) on brain health really got me worried.also , what is your opinion regarding these two studies ( sorry for repeating myself – i just posted reference to them as a reply to another user ) : ( 1 ) 1 . nutrient intakes in 94 japanese centenarians investigated between 1972 and 1973 showed a higher proportion of animal protein to total proteins than in contemporary average japanese . 2 . high intakes of milk and fats and oils had favorable effects on 10-year ( 1976-1986 ) survivorship in 422 urban residents aged 69-71 . the survivors revealed a longitudinal increase in intakes of animal foods such as eggs , milk , fish and meat over the 10 years . 3 . nutrient intakes were compared between a sample from okinawa prefecture where life expectancies at birth and 65 were the longest in japan , and a sample from akita prefecture where the life expectancies were much shorter . intakes of ca , fe , vitamins a , b1 , b2 , c , and the proportion of energy from proteins and fats were significantly higher in the former

factors on longevity and quality of life in japan.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pu … 2 ) is kind of a crappy review , in my opinion . they don ’ t consider likely objections very well , but there are lines of evidence indicating that animal foods reduce stroke mortality in japan . a lot of the mortality there is linked with smoking and excess salt , leading to hemhorragic stroke , as you can see . do you live like a japanese person and carry these risk factors in your lifestyle ? cholesterol often appears protective in the elderly but disease at the end of life often lowers cholesterol . serum albumin and milk consumption connect with healthy behaviors in japan , as they state about the perceived health of milk . so you often see it connecting with lower salt intake and higher fruit and vegetable intake . they observe this link with salt in the paper . meanwhile , while cerebrovascular disease has declined in japan over the years , as you can see in the plot , other forms of mortality in their plot have tread water , despite increased standards of medical care , public health , and increased fruit and vegetable consumption in recent decades . so we can ’ t really say that animal food is doing much for their other risks.the general complaint is that the authors are very association-happy . they show correlates of animal consumption and contrast between tertiles , but we have no particular reason to think that these associations would be real in an accurate model of all relevant factors.1 ) again you see a general comparison between akita and okinawa . the akitan population is more hypertensive . okinawans consumed more fruits and vegetables , less salt , and exchanging meat for fish probably also helps with hemhorragic stroke . cholesterol and albumin decline with age in the akitans , but can they really infer that this is not reverse causation here , a signal of the disease rather than a cause ? do they do any investigation into causality at all ? again , my general complaint is that they pool risks into all cause mortality and look for univariate correlates , or something pretty close to . this gets you into a heap of trouble because you cease to think of causal mechanisms and models when you do so , especially when you don ’ t state that your model adjusts for known risk factors in mortality among the japanese elderly.sorry if this is not as rigorous as you ’ d like , but it ’ s my quick response to the work of these works , which share the same lead author.thank you very much for the insight . i plan to continue my whole foods plant based diet experiment ( n = 1 : ) for at least half a year … laregelytrue : reviews of studies fascinate me . thanks for taking the time to do this . it is helpful for lots of people.you ’ re welcome . we are in a space where we need to read deeper to understand what ’ s going on , but we all don ’ t have all the time and skills to accurately judge all of the literature.it helps to bring some reading and reviewing into the open . it shows our weaknesses , it shows our strengths , and it suggests how we might improve our beliefs and arguments.hi mindaugas , i couldn ’ t read the entire article you linked to ( do you have access to it ? ) , but all the abstract states is results from changing from 41 % fat to 25 % fat . it does not say what the fat calories were replaced by ; often it is simple sugars in studies like this . also keep in mind that 25 % is not a low-fat diet in the opinion of the doctors who advocate for low fat vegan diets . for heart disease prevention , 10 % cal from fat is typically the benchmark . the okinawans , who enjoy excellent mental and physical health into old age , get about 6 % of their calories from fat.it reminds me a bit of the terrible “ low fat vs mediterranean ” diet study out last year where they looked at a medi diet with 39 % fat plus omega-3 supplementation and counseling vs a “ low ” fat 37 % fat diet without omega-3s or counseling and called the medi diet the winner . or a joke of a hillshire farms funded study i saw recently that claimed a high-protein ( i.e. sausage and egg ) breakfast could lead to weight loss because participants reported more satiety than those eating pancakes and syrup instead.you can google the full pdf , or here is the link to the full text : http : / / journals.cambridge.org /

sure i would worry about the results obtained from a pilot study of 20 people looking at the differences resulting from consumption of regular vs low-fat versions of “ mayo , french fries , and chips ” , with a third of the participants knowing which version they were eating . especially with many other studies available showing the mood benefits associated with increased starch consumption / serotonin levels , decreases in arachidonic acid , and even therapeutic effects from specific plant foods.have you tried entering your diet into cronometer to determine if any of your micronutrient levels are low ? yep , i ’ m using cronometer , most micronutrients seem fine , except b12 and vit d , but i supplement those . thanks for the reply ! it seems that reading opposing paleo blogs have the largest negative effect on my mood : ) ) ) in studies like the one you posted , they will give one group whole milk and the other skim milk . yeah , that gets their fat percentage down , but their animal protein levels go up , no wonder studies like the one you posted show harm for supposed “ lowfat ” diets . that ’ s not the healthy way to go lowfat.wow , the may just be dr. greger ’ s finest

study : nutrition and alzheimer ’ s disease : the detrimental role of a high carbohydrate diet.in this paper , we have highlighted that ad may also be caused by a deﬁciency in the supply chain of cholesterol , fats , and antioxidants to the brain . we have provided much evidence of the importance of these nutrients to brain function , and have shown that ad patients are deﬁcient in cholesterol and fats in the cerebral spinal ﬂuid.seneff s , et al , nutrition and alzheimer ’ s disease : the detrimental role of a high carbohydrate diet , european journal of internal medicine ( 2011 ) , http : / / people.csail.mit.edu / seneff / ejim _ published.pdfi ’ m gonna go eat some coconut oil : ) http : / / evolutionarypsychiatry.blogspot.com / 2011 / 06 / nutrition-and-alzheimers-disease.htmli am puzzled about how the paper by seneff et al. made it through the peer review process . it is full of logical leaps and speculation . seneff is a computer scientist engaged in the weston a. price foundation . she has no professional qualifications whatoever to write a paper about alzheimer ’ s but brings in at least as much dietary ideology as any vegan diet guru.she speculates about the causative role of advanced glycation end products ( ages ) in alzheimer ’ s disease and manages to completely ignore the role of dietary ages – which are present in copious amounts in cooked meat , cheese and fried foods – and which have been shown to excert strongly pro-inflammatory effects in healthy subjects and contrubite to metabolic impared insulin sensitivity and metabolic pathways associated with the pathogenesis of type ii diabetes ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ) . the evidence brought forth by vlassara et al. suggests that exogenous / dietary ages are a major causative factor in type ii diabetes and possibly other chronic diseases associated with a pro-inflammatory status ( e.g. upregulated rage and mtor signaling ) such as neurodegenerative diseases whereas endogenous ages are rather a consequence of impaired insulin sensitivity and type ii diabetes and the mechanism by which the disease finally exacerbates itself in a “ positive ” feedback-loop.dr. greger , wasn ’ t there research a while back that showed that vegetarians and vegans had twice the rates of degenerative brain disease due to chronic low b12 levels leading to elevated homocysteine leves ? so where does butter ( or , more specifically , indian ghee ) fit into this picture ? dr. greger more than once mentions how healthy indians are in this video . they cook with clarified butter ( ghee ) , and ghee is also the most widely used medicinal element in ayurvadic medicine . is ghee the exception to what dr. greger says about animal fat ? is that ok to cook with ? for me it is all about risk . the most comprehensive discussion of lifestyle issues that influence alzheimer ’ s disease is neal barnard ’ s power foods for the brain . he cites the studies which correlate certain things with greater risk such as cholesterol , saturated fat , zinc , iron , aluminum and lower risk such as exercise , sleep , cognitive activities . he also explains the effects on folks with the gene associated with it … apoe . i would imagine that small amounts of ghee would have more risk then none and less risk then alot of ghee . if you want to lower your risk eat less animal products and saturated fat while avoiding excess iron , zinc , aluminum along with exercise , sleep and mental activity . at this point i wouldn ’ t think that ghee is an exception but you need to stay tuned as the science keeps coming.zinc is very probably a protective rather than a risk factor , as it competitively inhibits copper metabolism . in many neurodegenerative diseases , such as alzheimer ’ s and parkinson ’ s , there is a striking disbalance between serum cu2 + and zn2 + in the cns as well as in the serum , shifted towards copper , that may aggrevate the disease.hence , a recently published small-scale rct has remarkably shown protection against cognitive decline in alzheimer ’ s patients with high dose ( 150 mg daily ) zinc supplementation.interestingly , the disregulation of metal homeostatis is closely related to an accumulation of cholesterol in the cns , both working in concert to enhance the accumulation of amyloid plaques . this shows that the hypothesis by seneff et al . , refered to below , that alzheimer ’ s results from cholesterol deficiency is utterly absurd.good points . the rct article gives a nice overview of the problem . the population was “ deficient ” in zinc so supplementing with zinc would seem to make sense in the short term . however recommending that populations take an isolated supplement over time is a different matter . it also may be a matter of dose in that zn has been shown in vitro to accelerate clumping of beta amyloid plaques . we need more and better studies to help prevent and slow the progress of this disease . given the time course of this disease we need longer term studies involving larger populations to help sort things out . even with those in hand there are problems with the use of reductionistic approaches to complex systems.wow ! ! ! simply , wow ! ! ! ! ! this upload of a few minutes is power packed with information ! ! ! ! it is also very , very sad to see that these new wave of ‘ professionals ’ jumped on the anti grain band wagon just to make the dollar bills ! ! ! from the get go their ‘ theory ’ was flawed and they knew it ! ! ! they used a blanket theory and took advantage of regular people like myself who needed to take a more in depth look at grains and how they really affect the human structure . they failed to really take a hard look at the numbers and percentages of people affected by gluten / grain sensitivity , gluten / grain intolerance and celiac ’ s disease . for example , i am a celiac . this does not mean that grains are all around evil . it simply means that specific to my genetic make up , gluten and grains are a definite no no . for others in my family this is not the case . gluten and grains procured from a reliable , non processed and preferably organic source in its proper balance are wonderful for the body . what really was the shocker for me was the shift in the japanese culture ! ! ! ! ! they have always been upheld as superior in eating habits because of their choices to rely much more heavily on vegan / plant based food ! ! ! as i studied the trends in the shift to more animal protein within the culture i didn ’ t want to acknowledge what seemed to be happening because i saw more and more a plethora of tiny restaurants popping up all over japan offering courses after courses of ‘ throw away ’ parts of the pig , chicken and beef . they would pile up little bamboo sticks with four to five chicken uterus ’ s , non laid eggs still found within the womb of the chicken , the parts of the pig ’ s throat and cow udder . they would be roasted on these bamboo sticks over a small open flame and eaten while drinking large amounts of sake . it is a sub culture that is really taking hold because the average tourist wants a more indigenous experience when they visit . it also pays homage to a time and place for the japanese just as ‘ soul food ’ does the same with the african american culture of the south . this doesn ’ t mean that it ’ s a good thing to practice.thank you ! ! ! it sickens me to think how people actually are ignorant enough to believe that grains , of all the natural foods millions of people have eaten for millions of years , are harmful to the brain and increase the risk of cognitive decline . it is disgusting how books like grain brain and wheat belly pray on the stupidity of the general population and actually have people convinced that a low-grain diet is beneficial . this is the type of information people should be listening to .. great video ! who funds this clown , monsanto or adm ? i cut out grains and sugar and lost 20 lbs . ( all in my gut ) in four months . do you think we have an obesity and diabetes epidemic because people are eating more steak , chicken , fish , vegetables , fruit and nuts ? no , we have an obesity epidemic because they are eating bagels , donuts and cereal for breakfast , huge bowls of “ fat-free ” pasta and pre-packaged crap for lunch and dinner , and gouging out on bags of pretzels and potato chips while they sit in front of the tv . this man should be arrested for malpractice . read wheat belly ! today ’ s wheat is not the wheat of 40 years ago . it ’ s mutated hybridized junk food , people ! tonight i will enjoy a nice piece of grilled fish with sautéed veggies . enjoy your bowl of pasta.what about the fashionable aspect of microbiota living in vegetarian or vegan ’ s guts when compare to meat eater ? there must be different and recently it has been emphasized the it role in immunity and many diseases ? anyone could share anything about such study ? the grant study in the sources list is more about how oxidation and inflammation are causes of alzheimers , and omega-3s from fish was the best counter to that . it also mentioned that plant forms of omega-3s were inferior to fish for this purpose . also , though i did not find this mentioned in the study , cooked oils , whether from animals or plants , are oxidative and inflammatory if they have had a chance to get rancid or are heated above their smoke point , not to mention what can happen during the processing of refined oils . so it is possible that the animal fat people are eating in these studies was oxidized during the cooking process ( to be safe , you have to saute with some sort of liquid on as low a heat as possible , and don ’ t let it blacken or brown ) , and also likely wasn ’ t organic and pastured . but i can ’ t find solid info about the quality of meat test subjects were eating . i think it was just what the general population eats . i ’ d really love to see a study that looks at high quality meat consumption ( organic , pastured , cooked in a way that doesn ’ t oxidize the fat ) , not conventional meat consumption , and i can ’ t find that info easily when i look through studies . does anyone know of one they can direct me to ? just throwing this out there since i decided to click on one of the sources referred to in this video , and it seemed to be a little different from what the video was saying.tobacco also protects against alzheimers , parkinsons and dementia … amongst many others.http : / / medicalxpress.com / news / 2011-04-tobacco-derived-compound-memory-loss-alzheimer.htmlhttp : / / www.reuters.com / article / 2007 / 03 / 20 / us-smoking-parkinsons-iduscol06339920070320you ’ re forgetting that most grains esp wheat aren ’ t what they used to be and are gmo ! also many people now can ’ t tolerate the grains for the same reason ! anne : actually , there is lots of evidence that whole grains , including wheat are very healthy for the majority of the public . dr. greger already has some videos on this topic , but if it interests you , stay tuned . dr. greger has an indepth series on wheat coming up that is really great . in that series , you will learn how very few people actually have wheat sensitivities – based on the actual science.some thoughts for you to consider : 1 ) in the us , gmo wheat has not been approved for growing or sales . that ’ s my understanding based on recent news stories . so , if you live in the us , you don ’ t have to worry about gmo wheat.2 ) almost no food , plant or animal ! , is “ what it used to be ” . humans have been selectively , dramatically breeding plants and animals to the point that very little of it resembles its original form . dr. greger has a great video talking about how chicken has evolved in the last 100 ? or so years . and there is a great ted talk that talks about how all our plant crops , including foods like brocolli , bear no resemblance to their “ wild ” forms . if you were only going to eat foods that humans have not changed through systematic breeding , there is very little you could eat . if you are interested in the ted talk , here it is : http : / / blog.tedx.com / post / 45914179742 / debunking-the-paleo-diet-christina-warinnerthere is tremendous conflict in these comments . perhaps there is something we can all agree on . eating whole foods is good for all of us . avoid anything processed . learn to cook . trust your instincts.i am really interested if anyone has any comments on this recent study ( http : / / annals.org / article.aspx ? articleid = 1900694 & resultclick = 3 # t1-3 ) i know the weakness is no clinical end point and it ’ s only a 12 month study . i just couldn ’ t find more details on the dietary intake between the groups as i ’ m sure there are some other confounders . any insight would be great.several studies show similar results : low carb , because it restricts such a major component of diet , and possibly because protein is satiating , does tend to produce greater weight loss than low fat . so then other cardiometabolic indicators tend to look better in the low carb group because of the greater weight loss . but the question is whether the weight loss can be sustained , and even more importantly , what the long term effects of a low carb diet are . and such data as there is ( on the long term effects ) suggests that low carb increases risk of cardiovascular disease , and accelerates mortality.just to play devils advocate , the diet advocated in the grain brain book includes very low carbs. i ’ m assuming that ’ s not what japan is eating now , they are still eating some rice … so one could say it ’ s the combo of animal fats and carbs that has led to the rise in dementia. whereas perhaps with low to no carbs , the animal fat increase would not lead to this problem ? thoughts anyone ? low-carb animal-fat diets are still problematic . have you read dr. greger ’ s book carbophopia ? i suggest reading his latest blog low carb diets found to feed heart disease . see if that helps ? thanks for your comment and please forgive my delay . africa , african-american , alzheimer ’ s disease , animal fat , animal products , asia , beans , cholesterol , dementia , europe , grains , india , iron , ldl cholesterol , low-carb diets , meat , nigeria , plant-based diets , rice , saturated fat , standard american diet , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians grain consumption appears strongly protective against alzheimer ’ s disease , whereas animal fat intake has been linked to dementia risk . a few previous videos on alzheimer ’ s and maintaining cognitive function : more on the consequences of carbophobia here :
PLAIN-258	nuts don 't cause expected weight gain nuts are packed with nutrition , but they are also packed with calories . why , then , don ’ t nuts seem to make people fat ? in my video nuts and obesity : the weight of evidence , i profile a review published back in 2007 looking at about 20 clinical trials that had been done on nuts and weight . not a single one showed the weight gain one would expect . all of the studies either showed less weight gain than predicted , no weight gain at all , or actual weight loss — even after study subjects added a handful or two of nuts per day to their diet . however , the studies lasted just a few weeks or months . what about long-term ? maybe in the short run nuts don ’ t lead to weight gain as much as other foods , but what about after years of eating nuts ? well that ’ s been examined six different ways in studies lasting up to eight years . one found no significant change and the other five out of six measures found significantly less weight gain and risk of abdominal obesity in those eating more nuts . since that review is now 5 years old , in my weight of evidence video i update it to include all of the studies published since , including a number published this year . for example , in 2012 there was study in which people added over a hundred pistachios to their daily diets for three months and didn ’ t gain a pound . how did 30,000 calories disappear ? what happened to the missing calories ? the mystery has been solved . in my video series that started with solving the mystery of the missing calories , i presented the “ pistachio principle ” and the fecal excretion theory . in my next video these theories were put to the test . i then explored the dietary compensation theory , and by the final video in the series we had figured it out . part of the trick seemed to be that nuts boost fat burning within the body . but how ? it could have something to do with the amino acid arginine ( see my 2-min. video fat burning via arginine ) or the phytonutrients found in nuts and green tea ( fat burning via flavonoids ) . since nut consumption has been associated with lower rates of heart disease and living a longer life we should include them in our regular diet without worrying that they ’ re going to make us fat . does it matter what type of nut and were the nuts raw ? yes , does it matter whether the nuts are raw or roasted ? and what about salt ? my dad eats packaged “ mixed nuts ” every day and my mom is convinced that they ’ re contributing to his weight gain.if you count calories , how can you explain that you will gain 50 gram of weight when you eat 10 gram of sugar candy ? conservation of mass in physics should exist . counting calories is a myth . what do you think ? the laws of physics do apply but “ weight ” loss or gain is complicated by a variety of factors . calories are important but more important is calorie density . we tend to eat to satisfy our hunger which is calmed by stretch and fat receptors in stomach plus nutrients absorbed into body . weight loss or gain can be due to changes in muscle mass , water , fecal material and / or fat . in working with patients at the mcdougall clinic who are eating a low fat starch based diet i observe weight loss during their stay based on fat loss ( less calories consumed while satisfying their hunger ) , water loss ( less sodium intake ) and faecal loss ( due to increase in transit time ) . the best introduction to the concept of calorie density is the dvd by jeff novick , calorie density : eat more , weigh less and live longer . doug lisle ’ s presentation , how to lose weight without losing your mind ” seen on you tube .. the laws of physics do apply but “ weight ” loss or gain is complicated by a variety of factors . calories are important but more important is calorie density . we tend to eat to satisfy our hunger which is calmed by stretch and fat receptors in stomach plus nutrients absorbed into body . weight loss or gain can be due to changes in muscle mass , water , fecal material and / or fat . in working with patients at the mcdougall clinic who are eating a low fat starch based diet i observe weight loss during their stay based on fat loss ( less calories consumed while satisfying their hunger ) , water loss ( less sodium intake ) and faecal loss ( due to increase in transit time ) . of course after leaving the program weight loss continues at about 1 / 2 to 2 pounds per week depending on exercise , where the patient started and how well they follow recommendations . the best introduction to the concept of calorie density is the dvd by jeff novick , calorie density : eat more , weigh less and live longer . doug lisle does an excellent job exploring the psychology and biology of losing weight in his two you tube video ’ s , “ how to lose weight without losing your mind ” and “ the pleasure trap ” ( he coauthored a book by the same title ) … both also available as dvd ’ s . the complexity of the nutritional science can be appreciated by viewing the 56 videos relating to obesity on dr. greger ’ s website . i would explain a weight gain of 50 grams with only the consumption of 10 grams of sugar as being related to some other factor and not violation of the laws of thermodynamics . happy new year.but what about fried nuts found most everywhere ? fantastic source of knowledge . thank you so much ! i am still confused about nuts and omega acid profiles . i read that almonds are preferable to peanuts , but their profiles seem similar.pingback : using the motivational triad to eat healthier , part 4 : energy efficiency | leading effectively : official blog of the center for creative leadership ( ) how do i reconcile esselstyn ’ s recommendations for no nuts or avocado for people with heart disease with the info on nut consumption.i love eating raw non gmo cashew butter . but seriusly , i don ’ t understand paleo guys saying ohhh nooo , it ’ ll cause leptin resistance . must be those lectins messing with our hormones . what a joke . arnold schwarzenegger even ate cashew butter to gain muscle mass . cashews have a high dense protein amino content . ( protein keeps you sated longer right ? ) same goes for pistachios and walnuts ( added benefit of higher omega 3 ratio ) plz tell me if im doing something wrong in my diet . im a college student who relies on my tasty unsweetened natural nut butters . their easy on the pockets too along with sprouted breads i usenb : i ’ m getting a lot of misinformation about nuts , legumes , beans and sprouts causing leptin resistance . especially the the talk of lectins bears in mind . and for the record i have a shitty metabolism and am super skinny now thanks to good protein dense carbs , nuts , legumes and cooking with virgin cocnut oilamazing research ! i really appreciate your dedication to make these incredibly interesting videos ! i always use them to educate myself more and more about my plant-based-whole-food lifestyle ! thanks for your work dr. greger : ) - - -
PLAIN-2589	anti-inflammatory life is a bowl of cherries haggis , the national dish of scotland , is a savory pudding of heart , liver , lungs , and oatmeal traditionally stuffed inside of a stomach . and when that stomach goes into our own stomach , our digestive enzymes and stomach acid have no problem digesting it away . but how come our body digests the stomach lining of a sheep on our plate , without digesting our own stomach lining ? it ’ s meat , we ’ re meat , why don ’ t we digest our own stomach every time we eat ? in part because we have an enzyme called cyclooxygenase that protects the lining of our stomach . there are two types , cox-1 and cox-2 . cyclooxygenase 1 is thought to be the primary protector of our stomach , whereas cox-2 is an enzyme responsible for pain and inflammation . in fact that ’ s how anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen , and naproxen work , by inhibiting the cox-2 enzyme . but these are nonselective drugs , they inhibit both cox-2 and cox-1 , which is trying to protect out stomach lining . that ’ s why though drugs like ibuprofen are great at relieving pain and inflammation , they kill thousands every year due to ulcerations through the stomach wall resulting in life-threatening bleeding and perforation.what are the risks on an individual level ? on average , one in about 1200 people who take this class of drugs for at least two months will die as a result . to put this into perspective , we can compare the death rate from anti-inflammatory drug side-effects to the risks associated with some well-known events . for example , it may be safer to go bungee jumping a few hundred times.so what we need is some sort of selective cox-2 inhibitor , inhibiting the pain and inflammation of cox-2 without inhibiting the stomach protection of cox-1 . and that ’ s what we got , anti-inflammatory drugs easier on the stomach . you remember vioxx right , blockbuster drug bought in billions in profits , before it started killing tens of thousands of peoples . internal emails show how the drug manufacturer responded to the revelation that they were killing people . they drew up a list of doctors who were trying to warn people to “ neutralize ” them , and if that didn ’ t work , discredit them.so is that what we ’ re left with ? death from internal bleeding from one type of drug , or death from heart attack from another type of drug . if only there was some sort of natural cox-2 inhibitor . there is - cherries , which unlike ibuprofen suppress cox-2 more than cox-1.in videos i did on insomnia and reducing muscle soreness , i talked about the benefits of sour cherries , the types of cherries used in baking . but this was for sweet cherries , you eat fresh . tart cherries had less of an effect . regular red sweet bing cherries were shown to have a greater anti-inflammatory activity than tart cherries , which makes sense , since we think it may be the anthocyanin phytonutrients in cherries , and there ’ s lots more in sweet red cherries than in tart , and nearly none in yellow rainier cherries.because fresh cherries have limited availability , what about other cherry products ? fresh is best , but frozen would appear to be the second-best choice . as always , awesome ! very pertinent to my everyday practice . this is what i teach my patients almost every single day.to beat the sting , eat the bing ! this is good info . thanks.as far as cherries and their inclusion on the fodmap list , how do you feel about fodmap-free diets ? i ’ ve read that fodmap issues could be responsible for bacteria in guts either depleting and or preventing absorption of b12 . any thoughts ? and it supposedly does wonders for those seeking relief from ibs issues . lots of people claiming to have great turns in health after going on low fodmap diets.remember that b12 is essential & can only be found in meat sources , mainly red meat . you cannot derive it from plant sources . if you are not eating red meat & are experiencing a decrease in energy , you must supplement b12 . cyanocobalamin variety must filter thru your liver before your body uses it . best to use methylcobalamin b12 ( raw ) as it ’ s instantly absorbed in your stomach & intestines . you will certainly notice the difference immediately ! your body also stores it for later use , so don ’ t overdo it ! one capsule ( usually in powder form , just pull capsule apart & add to your juice or water , best taken on an empty stomach before your morning meal ) will last your body probably 4-7 days . it ’ s economical & a real kickstarter ! you wrote … . ” your body also stores it methyl b12 ) for later use , so don ’ t overdo it ! ” does the science show conclusively that our bodies can store b12 from supplements for later use … .i am wondering how long it stores it for ? also , if b12 is water soluble vitamin , and water soluble vitamins get urinated out after the body grabs what it needs , how could we being storing b12 supplements ? maybe i ’ m just confused about something here , but logic seems to raise this question . thank you.hi nevo , good questions.water-soluble vitamins , are stored in the body for only a brief period of time and are then excreted by the kidneys . the one exception to this is vitamin b12 , which is stored in the liver for 2-3 yrs.you may be interested to view several of dr. greger ’ s b12 videos ( link below ) and to see the research be sure to click on sources cited under the video.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ? s = b12fodmap foods , for those who are adversely effected by them , are thought to create a bacterial environment in body that makes absorbing and retaining b12 ( from supplements or food ) difficult . just theories . but the list of fodmap success stories ( vegans as well as non-vegans ) is long and seems to be growing.dr. greger ’ s recommendation : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / which-type-of-b12-is-best / “ we don ’ t have as much data ( in terms of proper dosing and efficacy ) on preventing / reversing b12 deficiency in vegans with any other form that cyanocobalamin . until there is i ’ m less comfortable recommending it . ” in a study meat was shown to have a negative impact on b12 ballance . milk was best , supplements were second . and , there is little reasearch but , people not consuming treated water and processed food have show no or little signs of b12 deficiency ( yet to be reasearched ) , looks like diet itself isnt the major factor . “ cleaning ” the water and food very well might be.very helpful , however , and maybe i missed the answer to this , but what is the amount of cherries that is a recommend equivalent pill dosage ? good question.the study used 280 grams ( about 2 cups ) per day for 28 days.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16549461thank you , that ’ s good to know . does leave me wondering if i should include a small amount daily and “ up it ” to two cups a day when i have a specific problem arise.my 1st day of 2 cups of frozen bing cherries didn ’ t go too well . within 2 hours of ingesting a migraine started building up big time . was it all that sugar , 36 gms or what . this video like so many on this web site gives some information but not enough to know how to put it to practical use . and many of us couldn ’ t afford it anyway . of that 1 in 1200 that have bleeding problems what made them at risk and not others ? since it ’ s not practical for most of us to eat two cups of cherries everyday for almost a month , even if it ’ s frozen cherries , how about cherry juice concentrate ? dr. hemodynamic : oh , it ’ s you who let us know about the 2 cups ! i mis-remembered . thank you for this information ! i also messed up in terms of reading your post very carefully . i didn ’ t notice the “ per day for 28 days ” part . so , on tuesday morning , i felt a headache coming on . i said to myself , “ i have a bag that is just about 2 cups of sweet cherries . let ’ s try it . ” by 10 : 00 , i was in too much pain and had to take a pill . ( the cherries didn ’ t make my pain any worse , unlike what another poster said . it just didn ’ t stop the headache coming on . ) now that i see that it is a cumulative effect that must be taken every day for 4 weeks , i ’ ll have to think this through some more . i don ’ t mind spending money on my health . but : a ) there is a physical space issue in my freezer. b ) and then there is the issue of physically getting 2 cups of fruit into my tummy each day like that . i was pretty darn sick of eating cherries by the time i got to the bottom of the two cups last tuesday . i thought i loved cherries , but it turns out i don ’ t like them all * that * much. c ) and finally , there is the issue of whether or not i think it will really do all that much good for my particular case . i find that i need the migraine medicine more than i need the straight ibuprofen . if the point of the cherries is just anti-inflamatory effects , i don ’ t know how much it would really help me . i still might give it a 28 day try . i just have to think about it.i ’ m just sharing my experience . without your nice post , i would not know what i would need to do in order to try to replicate the results in myself . thanks ! i ’ m not crazy about the sugar load with 2 cups of cherries plus the $ 60 + per month , plus the need for freezer space i don ’ t have . and i ’ d be sick of them before the month half gone . even if the last 3 problems would work out the 1st one of 36gms of sugar per 2 cups cherries is a deal breaker . i will just continue with cayenne and other gut healing herbs.jean : i don ’ t share your concern with “ sugar ” . based on the research i have done , i ’ m very confident that table sugar and whole fruit are completely different “ animals . ” ( ha , ha ) also , i believe that two cups of cherries translates into 4 servings of fruit – well within established guidelines for healthy eating.as for the cost , it is a serious bummer , but i would rather spend even $ 100 per month or more even than die … so , it ’ s a concern and a bummer , but i would still do it if it worked.since i buy groceries once a week , this solution would mean finding room in my freezer for 7 bags of frozen cherries . i can do it . it would just require some creative shuffling and maybe not freezing some things that i would normally freeze . i also will have to eat some things to clean out the freezer . it ’ s a hassle , but may be worth the effort . if the cherries work , then i could get an extra freezer to put in the garage.then again , i have found that frozen fruits and veggies do just fine in the regular refrigerate for at least a few days . so , i wouldn ’ t have to find room for all 7 bags in the freezer.the biggest concern i have , and one that i share with you , is just getting sick of eating that much cherries . i had trouble getting through one day ’ s worth . so , spooning 2 cups day in and day out for a month , let alone the rest of my life ( or at least until menopause ) is something i have doubts about . but i do really , really , really want to get off the pills … i think i maybe just talked myself into giving it a try.thanks for sharing . we may not share the exact the same concerns , but it was interesting to see what factors are important to someone else and that i ’ m not the only person who maybe likes cherries , but not that many.you are fortunate if it is really just the monthly migraine . mine were monthly in pre-menopause but steadily worsened after menopause . have to drive 25 miles to a city to buy frozen cherries and an extra freeezer would be prohibitive . i will stay tuned to see if the experiment works for you.jean : yes , it ’ s once a month , but it is once a month for two almost solid weeks . it doesn ’ t feel lucky most of the time . but since , as you point out , it could get worse , i should probably count my blessings.excellent information , dr. greger ! glad to read about the skullduggery involving pharmaceutical companies and how they neutralize those who know the facts , which most folks are not aware of , but ought to be . that type of information is part of being an informed healthcare consumer , i contend . furthermore , consumers should have available via the media more candid and open discussion ( s ) regarding big pharma ’ s ‘ turf ’ protection activities . thank you for what you do.on videos or articles like this which present the benefit of a specific food , i wonder … how was that food chosen for study ? is there reason to believe the particular food is much better than other plant foods at delivering the studied benefit ? this video is hugely relevant to my own situation since i take a lot of nsaids – either straight ibuprophen or as part of over-the-counter migraine medication . without the drugs , i get in so much pain , i can ’ t function . so , it is a risk i feel i have to take or risk loosing my job , social activities , etc . however , maybe the next time i get a headache i will try to eat a couple cups ( thanks for the dosage darryl ! ) of cherries instead . it seems worth a try.i should add , i was previously , generally aware of stomach bleeding potential of nsaids , but i was not aware of the specifics shared in this video . very scary . thanks dr. greger for the info.wow , have you been tested for food allergies ( wheat , barley , gluten in general ) ? what causes your chronic migraines ? i ’ d hate for anyone to have to endure repeated dosing with nsaids because they can be so damaging.based on years of personal observation , i believe these problems are related to my menstral cycle , not food . thanks for your concern , though.if you have not already done so , please consider 6 months completely free of all beans and grains . ( stay vegan , though ) eliminate all nightshades as well.so much of what you already know might prevent you from being open to this – but this path has worked for so many people , not just vegans . start slowly , then 100 % . there is really no way of explaining the shift in how the body feels until one experiences bean and grain free for a significant amount of time . changes lives.guest : i understand that you are trying to be helpful . i appreciate that . but as you say , so much of what i already know prevents me from being open to this idea . i ’ ve done a fair amount of research on the topic . there is so much overwhelming and compelling evidence concerning the health benefits of whole grains and beans . just look at the videos on this site alone . plus , i do not find the evidence against whole grains and beans ( found on other sites ) to be compelling at all . thus , for my own diet , it would be foolish of me to stop eating those healthy foods.i understand that other people feel that they get a benefit from eliminating these 2 out of the 5 main food groups . if you are such a person , i hope your diet does benefit you long term and wish you well.just remember , your situation involves a lot of nsaids , and this is not the case for the majority of the population . and most people can eat beans and grains without problems ( debatable ) , but for now , please consider that you might be the exception , and that the conventional and well established benefits of beans and grains just might not apply to your situation . this just might be your chance at freedom . it just takes accepting some irony and paradoxical thought . such is life . best of luck to you.sounds like you need 4000mg omega3 every 4-6 hours with lots of magnesium ascorbate and some salt bathes for detox . two tablespoons of ground flax seeds provides 4000mg omega3 . i ’ d like dr greger to return to the subject of too much flax is goitrogenic.rivka : thanks for your input ! ! fyi : i do currently take 2 t ground flax a day . but only once a day … take care and thanks again for your thoughts.i have migraines also managed with nsaids . can not find a food link and have tried for a long time . did change to a whole foods plant based starchivore diet 3 + years ago . was discouraged because just seemed to get worse . but my last acute attack was 7 months ago . since then they are silent to mild migraines but things change and who knows what tomorrow will bring . at least the rest of me is healthy . i would rather use nsaids than be sick , dehydrated , unable to eat or drink and non-functional . trying some cherries seems an easy experiment.jean : thanks for sharing ! i didn ’ t notice a change in my headaches one way or another when i went vegan . i ’ m glad things have gotten better for you the last 7 months . i ’ ll keep my fingers crossed that it will continue to get better for you . “ there is so much overwhelming and compelling evidence concerning the health benefits of whole grains and beans . ” you are right . i have been eating different types of beans with every meal , generally either red kidney beans , black beans , black kabuli chickpeans , immature soybeans or tofu . i had to increase my protein intake as a result of a lot more exercise . i can ’ t see any harm in eating beans , and migraines are not a common symptom of eating grains ( even if you have celiac ) . on the other hand , i have heard of naturopaths curing people of things like psoriasis by eliminating common categories of foods ( such as dairy , soy , gluten , etc ) .dgh : thanks for jumping in ! i value your input.your post was also a good reminder to me about getting more beans into my diet . you are good role model . thanks ! they ( beans ) are the only complete source of protein in a vegan diet , and they ( beans ) include peas , peanuts and soy.i used to get migraines … usually just the shimmering lights , little pain . anyway , i ’ ve been drinking / eating black currant / beet juice or the whole foods for about a year and the frequency has gone way down . i have made other changes too but somehow the daily dose of anthos seems to be the best preventative for me . best wishes ! coacervate : that ’ s fascinating . i collect stories about what helps other people with their headaches and usually end up trying them at some point.one of the reasons i said your post is fascinating : the black currant idea . i have a family member who is carefully taking black currants every day to help with glaucoma / trying to stop vision loss . she started doing this after seeing dr. greger ’ s video on the subject . it ’ s still early to tell , but an initial test at the doctor ’ s shows positive / good results ! i found some “ black jumbo raisins ” at trader joes . i like them and have been eating them . i wonder if they have the same stuff that the black currents have in them . also , i found some black beluga lentils at the grocery store . they are the first lentil that i like . and i wonder if they have the anthos … stuff in them too . if so , maybe i could try eating those foods more consistently . i ’ m not a fan of the black currant juice . ( yuck on my taste buds ) but i think i would enjoy the black lentils and black jumbo raisins – especially if i could figure out the dosage . just thinking about the possibilities.thanks again for sharing your experience . most intriguing.i am curious – how do you cook the lentils and what do you eat them in / with ? dgh : i first got interested in the black beluga lentils 1 ) because of their color and 2 ) because i was working on the following recipe : http : / / mouthwateringvegan.com / 2013 / 04 / 07 / my-vegan-burger-king / the recipe calls for the fat green french lentils . i thought that these black babies would work just as well.i cooked them just like i would any dried bean – except that i didn ’ t soak them first . it ’ s been long enough that i don ’ t remember how long i cooked them , but i think you could use the same directions you would use for the green french lentils ( for which i am thinking directions can be found on the internet ) .so , i ’ ve only made the black beluga lentils twice . i want to make them more part of my regular diet . which means that i would use them in other recipes than just the one i listed above . what i particularly like about the black ones is the texture . more like little baby beans than the mushy stuff that traditional flat lentils usually end up being . so , i ’ m thinking you could use these black ones just like you would any other little bean … very interesting . thanks for this information . i will read the packet instructions on how long to cook them . i do know that you don ’ t soak lentils first . it is amazing how diverse legumes are , in terms of what dishes they can go into.you ’ re on to it . keep trying till it works for you . here is my recipe : 1 shot of single strength unsweetened black currant juice ( aarrghh ! ) , 1 shot of single strength red beet juice ( i freeze and press a few kg every week , freeze then thaw to get heaps of sweet juice ) , 1 / 2 shot of ginger extract ( i make this by boiling grated root , filter ) . mix and top up with selzer water to taste . the flavours balance out nicely . wish i could send you some to try.coacervate : thanks for posting your actual recipe ! i ’ m definitely interested in trying it.one thing i ’ m impressed with is that you make the beet juice and ginger extract yourself . i think i know what to do for the ginger extract , but i ’ m not sure about the beet juice . do you freeze raw beets and then squeeze them by hand ? or do you have a juicer ? do you cook first ? the inclusion of ginger was especially interesting to me because there was another poster on this site who said she uses ginger to help with her migraines . i gave it a shot and it did not work . but then again , i didn ’ t follow the instructions very well . i didn ’ t take nearly as much as the poster did . i don ’ t think i could do that . instead , i made a home-made ginger tea . that is not a fair test because i didn ’ t get any whole ginger in me , let alone the concentration the poster is doing.thanks again for providing more details . i am even more intrigued.first , my opinion is that you need to establish a certain baseline level of “ goodies ” to minimize the frequency and severity of migrates . so i would try a daily dose rather than reactively drinking a single treatment.beet juice is easy : wash and then freeze whole beetroot . thaw , slice and then squeeze . we use one of these : http : / / store.nexternal.com / homebrew / fruit-press-ferrari-mini-p870.aspxmix with black currant … it has a low ph that stabilizes the ppo browning that runs rampant in neutral ph beet juice.it is so good we just got into a habit and now we always have some fresh beet juice or pull em out of our garden and boil in vinegar . i ’ m addicted to them because they are so sweet and they make me feel great.i like to mix beet ( betalain ) pigment with currant ( anthocyanin ) to encourage synergy that may exist witht he two … add some ginger and it is amazing.one last thing … all of my sad eating friends just love the fizzy curannt / beet / ginger drink. it is very “ more-ish ” . cheers ! coacervate : thanks for the follow up information ! also , your point about “ … i would try a daily dose … ” is well received , especially in light of this study were people had to take the cherries every day.how does aspirin effect the cox 1 and cox 2 action ? if i remember back to class , aspirin works on a different pathway so it don ’ t not cause ulcers or stomach linings issues . it does thin the blood thougha description is found here : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / aspirin # mechanism _ of _ actionactually , aspirin does cause stomach issues . bleeding and anemia if overused . they all do . except less with cox 2 . but that decreases the good prostacyclin which is important for cv health.wow. i never heard of that merck story . got to love the freedom of information act . neutralizing scientists … that is nuts ! dr greger , could you please make a video or article to clear up the news on lectins . low carbers say they are toxic , but clearly they can ’ t be if high carb plant based is the way to go ? the more beans the better right ? from what i read on this site their potential toxic effect is decreased by cooking … or if you want look at this video : http : / / plantpositive.squarespace.com / blog / 2012 / 3 / 24 / tpns-24-in-defense-of-beans.htmlwhat about dark sweet cherries ? the more colour the more effect would be the conclusion of the story.so for the biggest bang for your freezer space , freeze the darkest you can find for future ailments.mmmm next tooth ache i ’ ll give that a try . a foundation of cherries and dose up from there : ) as 4 beans as a non allergic person towards foods in general , i do bump into limits especially with lentils which i had to give up . other beans are ok till about 250 grams a day . any more and things go wrong in a dose dependant way . dose and observe the effects would be my advice.i personally go the cut oats , quinoa and sweet potatoe combo as carb staple . cooked in white tea and lemon water . spiced up with spices ( ceylon cinnamon , cloves 0.1g , coconut ) , berries and a wee bit of extra protein powder . cook a batch every 2 days to last 6 servings. very tasty and none of the stomach upset.dear honored doctor , how many fresh sweet bing cherries would it take to equal 1 dose of ibuprofen ? let ’ s say , 200mg of ibuprofen to xg of bing cherries ? if a bing cherry is 8g , how many cherries would = 200mg of ibuprofen ? ahh … please tell me if this calculation is correct dear , kind , good doctor : 100g of bing cherries = 86.6mg of anthocyanin ( fresh flesh + skin ) 1g of bing = .866mg anthocyanin 0.866mg * x = 200mg ( x = grams of bing ) 200 / 0.866 = x 230.947 = x ~ 231 grams of bing cherries = 200mg of anthocyanin since , 1 bing = 8g , 8g * x = 231g = > = > ~ 29 cherries = 200mg of anthocyanin therefore , eating 29 fresh bing cherries should produce an equivalent pain relief as a normal does of ibuprofen pill but without letting our body digest its own stomach and intestines . what do you think ? p.s. 8g of 1 bing might include mass of pit , which in normal cases will not be consumed and therefore changes the # of bing to equal 200mg anthocyanin.if so , a new calculation would be necessary , but i don ’ t think the pit is more than 15 % of the cherry weight , so , 29 bing is accurate to a + 15 % rate of error ( dependent on pit mass data ) 29 might be good , but 34 will certainly give 200mg of anthocyanin to your blood cells . please let me know what you think about the calculation . thank you for all that you do.not all anthocyanins are “ created ” equal , without the knowledge which ones work and which ones don ’ t the only thing left is guesswork.calculations based on guesstimates will not give you any usefull insight.i really want to try this for my boyfriend . he takes aleve on a very regular basis which worries me . i had to stop taking nsaids because they trigger heart palpitations for me . then again , i have a negative reaction from most of the medications i have ever tried . my primary care physician tried to tell me that isn ’ t possible because nsaids are good for the heart . yes , i am looking for a new pcp . i ’ m thinking maybe i can make a smoothie with a good portion of sweet cherries and other anti-inflammatory fruits or spices . i have to come up with an easy , yet tasty , way to convince him to try it . he does drink cranberry juice on occasion , which he claims to get good results from.fwiw , my wife suffered strange reactions ( mottled face , itchy nose , headache ) to a wide variety of foods but nothing made sense until we tried eliminating all high salicylate foods . bingo . it is no small undertaking because they are everywhere but well worth the trouble if you are so afflicted . just a thought . best wishes ! here ’ an interesting quote from http : / / www.food-info.net / uk / colour / anthocyanin.htm : anthocyanins occur in nearly all plant families and thus in many edible plants . in food , the main sources of anthocyanins are berries , such as blackberries , grapes , blueberries etc , and some vegetables , such as egg-plants ( aubergine ) and avocado . other sources include oranges , elderberry , olives , red onion , fig , sweet potato , mango and purple corn . the natural production of anthocyanins in nature is estimated to be 109 tonnes / year ! … anthocyanin content in some edible plants foodstuffanthocyanin in mg per 100 g foodaubergine ( egg plant ) 750 black currant 130-400 blackberry 83-326 blueberry 25-497 cherry 350-400 chokeberry 200-1000 cranberry 60-200 elderberry 450 orange ~ 200 radish 11-60 raspberry 10-60 red currant 80-420 red grape 30-750 red onions 7-21 red wine 24-35 strawberry 15-35http : / / lpi.oregonstate.edu / infocenter / phytochemicals / flavonoids / flavtab2.htmltable 2 : anthocyanin , flavanol and proanthocyanidin content of selected foods ( mg / 100g or 100 ml * ) ( 3 , 129-135 ) anthocyanin-rich foods anthocyanins flavanols proanthocyanidinsblackberry 89-21113-196-47blueberry 67-183188-261grapes , red 25-92244-76raspberries ( red ) 10-84 9 5-59strawberry 15-75 – 97-183red wine 1-351-55 24-70plum 2-251-6106-334red cabbage 250 – red onion 13- 25 – – blood orange juice 3-10 – – flavanol-rich foodsanthocyanins flavanols proanthocyanidinsgreen tea – 24-216 – black tea – 5-1584chocolate , dark – 43-6390-322apple , red delicious with peel 1-42-1289-148apricot – 10-25 8-13http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / anthocyanin # in _ food food source anthocyanin content in mg per 100 g açaí 320 blackcurrant 190 – 270 chokeberry 1,480 [ 8 ] eggplant 750 blood orange ~ 200 marion blackberry 317 [ 9 ] black raspberry 589 [ 10 ] raspberry 365 wild blueberry 558 [ 11 ] cherry 350 – 400 redcurrant 80 – 420 purple corn 1,642 [ 12 ] purple corn leaves 10x more than in kernels [ 13 ] concord grape 326 [ 14 ] norton grape 888 [ 14 ] anyone know where i can buy purple corn ? we aremother nature ’ s berries contain more anti-inflammatory polyphenols than cherries , canada blueberry : phenol-explorer.eu / contents / food / 126 nutritionfacts.org / video / best-berries / do black cherries fit into the category of “ sweet cherries ” – the cherries with the anti-inflammatory power ? please , you can see this : roofers in londonthis is interesting information but not practical . 2 cups of cherries per day every day is expensive and not necessary as there are other foods / spices that are cox-2 inhibiters such as turmeric , ginger and boswellia . much easier and less expensive to use.at least one person expressed interest in hearing back from me if i gave this a try . so , for anyone interested : i tried to see if i could get this idea of cherries = ” some migraine help ” to work for me . today marks the end of a two month trial period . what happened ? bottom line : i don ’ t think all those cherries did much for me . or if it did , the effect was not enough to make it worth my effort to continue the experiment . next stop : i ’ m going to try coacervate ’ s idea , if i can work out a few technical difficulties.before you decide my experience is in any way meaningful , you might want to read some important details : • except for two days when i ate fresh cherries , i ate frozen cherries . as the video says , frozen is not as effective as fresh . ( though it is second best ) . • i ate two cups a day – but two cups as measured when frozen . when they thawed out , it was more like a cup and half a day . • i haven ’ t read the original study . i have absolutely no idea how close i came to replicating it . maybe i fell far short ? • out of the two months , i know of only two days where i did not eat any cherries that day . on the other hand , the two days when i ate fresh cherries – i ate far more than two cups . • i went for convenience over cost . one of my local grocery stores sells convenient two cup bags of frozen cherries . every day was very easy : i just grabbed a bag from the freezer . no measuring necessary . i could take it to eat anywhere , including throughout the day at work . however , these bags cost almost $ 6 / bag . for some people like myself , that ’ s quite spendy if you are buying 7 bags a week . it would be worth it if there was a dramatic effect , but not so worth it for the effect , if any , that i got . • i bought organic , sweet cherries . • i didn ’ t take this seriously in that i did not quantify symptoms before or during experiment . in other words , in order to do a fair self-test , i should have done the following : i should have spent 3 months leading up to the test documenting every day that i experienced migraines , rating them on intensity and marking how many and which kind of pills i took . and then i should have continued that important documentation during the two month trial period . then i could have some data that i could have used to see if there really was any effect or not . without that data and with so many migraines and pills during the trial period , all i can say is : i did feel during part of the trial period that while i was still getting migraines , the pain was not quite as intense and i was able to take fewer pills . maybe . since i didn ’ t do the proper documentation and since the effect was minor enough that i couldn ’ t say for sure , i ’ m just going by gut feeling and that gut feeling could be based more on me wanting the experiment to work than it actually working . • my initial concern about finding space in my freezer for all those cherries was very much misplaced . those nice convenient two cup bags of cherries easily fit into nooks and crannies in my freezer . • another concern that was misplaced was my fear that i would not enjoy the experiment . i found that once again , dr. barnard was correct : you like what you eat . the more i ate the cherries , the more i enjoyed the experience and looked forward to eating them . even after two months of eating two cups a day , i am not sick of cherries . i found my enjoyment of the cherries increased for a while as the days passed . then it plateau-ed into a steady enjoyable level without hitting an addictive enjoyment . also on the taste topic : this was a great experiment to do in the summer . there were many a hot days when i really enjoyed sucking on partially frozen cherries . it was a nice summer treat . • on the negative side of enjoyment : it seems that most experts feel that 3 to 4 servings of fruit a day is about right or perhaps the maximum . at two cups a day , i was eating 4 servings . so , i felt that eating other fruit may not be all that healthy . and i found that i missed the variety that i am used to having each day , including , often , an apple , which is also very healthy to eat every day.note that even studies with great results don ’ t often work for everyone . so , just because this didn ’ t work for me , doesn ’ t mean that it won ’ t work for you . no way to know unless you try.i am trying to find out about silver sol product … is silver a cancer causing agent if used in a product.after watching this video i ’ ve been eating cherries daily for several days . ( the frozen ones are the only ones available now , but they make a great shake , so i use two cups . ) all the hip pain is gone . gone . that ’ s crazy . how is it working that well , that quickly ? one question — the video says cherries have less of a cox-1 inhibiting effect . as i looked at the bar graphs , it seemed they still had that effect in pretty good amounts . are cherries also dangerous at certain levels of usage ? what about dried cherries or cherry capsules ? good question . i wold say fresh first , then frozen , dried , and capsules ( if there is no other way to obtain the other sources . even then , i haven ’ t seen any research on cherry caps and sometimes antioxidant supplements can be potentially harmful . i would not suggest the capsules. abdominal pain , alternative medicine , anthocyanins , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cherries , complementary medicine , enzymes , frozen fruit , heart disease , heart health , ibuprofen , inflammation , insomnia , internal bleeding , meat , mortality , muscle health , muscle soreness , oatmeal , organ meats , pain , phytonutrients , side effects , stomach health , stomach inflammation , stomach ulcers , tart cherries , vioxx sweet red bing cherries may act as a selective cox-2 inhibitor , reducing inflammation without the damage to our stomach and gut lining caused by nsaid drugs like ibuprofen . here are the links to the videos i mentioned about tart pie cherries : tart cherries for insomnia and reducing muscle soreness with berries.other studies in which anti-inflammatory drugs were compared natural dietary remedies include : turmeric curcumin and osteoarthritis and turmeric curcumin and rheumatoid arthritis.anti-inflammatory activity in a test tube is one thing , but can cherries actually be used clinically to treat inflammatory diseases ? stay tuned for my next video , gout treatment with a cherry on top .
PLAIN-2599	alpha gal and the lone star tick in the beginning , aristotle defined two forms of life on planet earth : plants and animals . 2000 years later , the light microscope was invented and we discovered tiny , one-celled organisms like amoebas . then the electron microscope was invented and we discovered bacteria . finally , in 1969 biologists recognized fungi as a separate category and we 've had at least five kingdoms of life ever since.in my video , higher quality may mean higher risk , i talk about the potential downsides of consuming proteins from within our own kingdom , because of the impact our fellow animal proteins can have on boosting our liver 's production of a cancer-promoting hormone called igf-1.in eating outside our kingdom , i talked about other potential advantages of preferably dipping into the plant and mushroom kingdoms for dinner , not only from a food safety perspective — we 're more likely to get infected by animal pathogens than dutch elm disease , but because of the potential for cross-reactivity between animal and human proteins . our immune system is more likely to get confused between this and this , rather than this and that , and so there may be less potential to trigger an autoimmune reaction , like the degenerative brain diseases i talked about . same concept with animal proteins triggering inflammatory arthritis . in attacking some foreign animal meat protein , some of our own similarly composed tissues may get caught in the crossfire.and it 's not just proteins . if you remember the neu5gc story , there 's this sialic acid in other animals that may cause inflammation in our arteries and help breast tumors and other human cancers to grow.well now a new twist has been added to the story . the reason neugc triggers inflammation is because humans lost the ability to make it two million years ago , and so when our body is exposed to it through animal products , it 's treated as a foreign molecule . well there 's another oligosaccharide called alpha-gal that we , chimps , and apes lost the ability to make 20 million years ago , but is still made by a variety of animals , including many animals we eat.alpha-gal antibodies may be involved in a number of detrimental processes that may result in allergic , autoimmune and “ autoimmune like ” diseases , such as auto-immune thyroid disorders . you see higher levels in crohn ’ s disease victims ; they react against about half of human breast tumors and you can even find antibodies to this stuff in atherosclerotic plaques in people 's necks , but those are all mostly speculative risks . we do know alpha-gal is a major obstacle to transplanting pig organs into people , like kidneys , because our bodies reject alpha-gal as foreign . it 's considered the major target for human anti-pig antibodies.it 's interesting if you look at those that abstain from pork for whatever reason , they have fewer swine-specific white cells in their bloodstream , speculating that oral intake of pork could ferry swine molecules into the bloodstream via gut-infiltrating lymphocytes to prime the immune response.so you can certainly have an allergic reaction to eating the kidneys too , but such severe meat allergies were considered rare , until an unusual report surfaced . first described in 2009 , the report included details on 24 cases of meat allergies triggered by tick bites . within a year , it was obvious that the cases should be counted in hundreds rather than dozens . by 2012 , it was clear that there are thousands of cases across a large area of the southern and eastern u.s. , and now present in several countries around the world.the lone star tick , so-called because females have a white spot on their back . they 're famous for causing masters ' disease , a lyme-disease like syndrome , also known as stari , southern tick associated rash illness . but thanks to the lone star tick steadily expanding its range , it 's not necessarily just so southern any more.ok , but what is the relevance of tick bites to the production of anti-meat allergy antibodies to alpha-gal ? good question . what we know is you get bit by one of these ticks , and you can develop an allergy to meat . this appears to be the first example of a response to an external parasite giving rise to an important form of food allergy , either because there 's something in the tick saliva that 's cross-reacting with the alpha-gal , or because the tick is like injecting you with animal allergens from its last meal . there is a typo in the transcript : “ the reason neugc triggers inflammation is because humans lost the ability to make it two million years age ” age instead of ago.thanks adrien , i just fixed it ! if you really want to reach more people it would be good to have a second voice on here presenting data that isn ’ t so strongly anti meat. a more balanced website would have more reach.i ’ d like to see what is the best meat ? what is the best ( animal ) milk ? this website has worked well in making mine and my family ’ s lives far healthier but a balanced view for those attempting to change may be more useful than preaching to the choir.your voice is a trusted one with lots of logic. the people you want to save the most will be the most resistant to change – give them some baby steps.ive watched all your videos. from a general perception on your presentations i no longer eat meat and eggs but still enjoy an organic beef steak once in a while. is this the best idea ? i have no idea.typo. i no longer eat chicken “ not in the choir ” : i appreciate your post in that i think it is an understandable and respectfully submitted opinion even if i disagree with it.you may be interested to know that there * is * a video on this site covering the healthiest meat . and there is even a video on how to reduce cancer risk for meat eaters . so , in my opinion , it is not fair to say that dr. greger leaves meat eaters “ out to dry ” or is unbalanced. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / good-grub-the-healthiest-meat / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / reducing-cancer-risk-in-meateaters / i don ’ t consider it a bad thing that dr. greger is also honest about what meat consumption does to your risks – even low meat eating : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / low-meat-or-no-meat / balance is a false concept when it comes to health . to me , your request would be like saying on another site , “ you should really give a ballanced view of eating sugar . you are being too biased talking about the problems with sugar . you are not going to reach as many people that way . ” if i went to a site to learn about sugar , i would want to know the expert ’ s honest opinion . i would not want it sugar ( ha , ha ) coated . after absorbing the honest information about sugar , it would be up to me to decide what to do with that information . personally , i understand that sugar is bad for me . i still eat it , but i limit how much i eat . ( fyi : i think the evidence against meat , dairy and eggs show those products to be way than sugar health-wise , not mention unethical , and so i chose to simply remove them from my diet rather than try to limit them . ) the same is true on this site . dr. greger can ’ t tell you what the healthiest dairy is if he doesn ’ t believe it is healthy . period . my take is : this site is not a popularity contest . it is a place to learn the truth ( at least one person ’ s truth – shared by many ) about nutrition . then , as you have already chosen , you can decide which pieces of advice you will follow and which ones you will ignore . at least you will be educated on the topic and know what you are doing / knowingly take on the risks.i like your idea of baby steps . cold turkey ( ha , ha again ) just doesn ’ t work for everyone . sometimes ‘ baby steps ’ is exactly what people need . but , again , it is not up to dr. greger to change his health message . instead , i hope that people who are looking for baby steps will ask those kinds of questions and people like me and other ( better ) comments on this site will provide useful suggestions.it sounds like you yourself have made a series of baby steps that are likely to add to you and your family ’ s health . that ’ s very cool . you are on a path . hopefully you are not stuck . hopefully you will be able to continue down the path of good health . i ’ m glad you visit this site . i hope this site continues to help you , and i wish you all the best health in future.i guess over the last four years , i , too , have taken baby steps to being vegan . first i eliminated meat and then over time , i stopped eating eggs , and greatly reduced dairy in my diet . i am in the last phase now of eliminating foods that have traces of dairy in them , such as chocolates and coffee creamers . i now buy the so delicious coconut milk creamer as well as silk soy creamer . just like you , i limit sugar for prudence sake , but from an ethical point view , meat , dairy and eggs are a complete no no , even though i haven ’ t completely gotten there , but i have improved a lot . writing down everything i eat everyday does help in that it makes me think about everything i put in my mouth . i lost a lot of weight before i became plant based by exercise and writing down what i eat , but after becoming plant based , i lost even more weight . i still place a high priority on exercise as well- i commute to work by bicycle . it is important to be plant based , but also to do it correctly . some ex “ vegans ” say this diet created so and so deficiency , but that is their fault that they didn ’ t make sure they got these vitamins from the beginning . i have been drinking fortified soymilk from the beginning to get enough b12 and calcium . i now also eat red star nutritional yeast to add even more b12 , as well as the other b vitamins . i eat greens every single day , as well as ground flaxseeds and lots of nuts as well . i think i get enough vitamin d from being out in the sun bicycling , but i should get a test.daniel : thanks for sharing your story ! i really enjoyed reading it . i ’ m more like you than the cold-turkey-ers . i admire people who can completely change their diet in a day , but i ’ m not one of them.you sound like you are totally on the right path to me . i find that every time i feel that i have hit a plateau , i am able to make another small change to my diet that helps me be healthier . as far as i ’ ve come , i still have a long way way to go ( in my book ) . i just keep with the “ yet ” method and find it does well for me . instead of saying , “ i don ’ t like leafy greens and will never eat enough of them . ” i try to remember to say , “ i don ’ t like leafy greens yet . i don ’ t eat enough of them yet . but i will keep trying and keep an eye out for ways that will help me move in that direction . ” i find that by keeping an open mind like that , i am often able to take the next baby step — surprising myself , because i didn ’ t really think i would ever really do it.best of luck to you ! thanks , thea . one thing you might try for the sake of greens is finding the right seasoning . i am from indiana , but now live in atlanta and one thing southerners know how to do is to season greens to make them taste good . of course , the fatback is a big no no , but what i have found makes greens taste good is balsamic vinegar . i eat raw turnip greens , along with a beet slice , a carrot and one half of a small tomato . i put a little nutritional yeast , turmeric , curry powder and the balsamic vinegar and blend them all up . i find i like the taste of it . the one green i don ’ t have too much of a taste for is kale , mainly because it is so bitter . but i don ’ t think turnip greens have any less nutritional value . also , getting rid of animal products to me is more inspired by the enormous cruelty involved and does not depend on it being unhealthy , even though i do think it is unhealthy . even if they proved there was a health value to eating animal products , i am still not going to eat them , mainly because of the horrible images i have seen of animal mistreatment on factory farms . thanks again , and good luck.daniel : thanks for the tips ! i invested in some really good balsalmic vingear ( aged 18 years ) , but haven ’ t tried it with your seasoning idea . i ’ m definitely going to give it a try ! i would be curious if you found the taste to be good in this . balsamic vinegar is delicious and it seemed that once i discovered it , the price went up ! i discovered it going to salad bar restaurants . turmeric also has a nice taste , and dr greger also recommends it for the health value . i actually saw real turmeric roots at the farmer ’ s market here . i haven ’ t tried them yet , i mainly use the powdered form . you might also add a few walnuts ( or other nuts ) , in order to increase absorption of the carotenoids . mustard greens could be tried , as they are actually very spicy in taste , and not bitter . if you respond to this , i would know , because i would be emailed to know if there was a response.daniel : the good news is that i gave it a try . and also good news is that i didn ’ t hate it . but i also have to report that i didn ’ t love it either . : - ( but i really appreciate the suggestion ! i just need to keep trying . i think that every time i try something like this , my tastes change a bit more.thanks.i guess that is progress . i am working on adjusting my taste buds to the completely non dairy coffee creamers . good luck ! funny , baby steps never seems to work for me . i changed my diet overnight a few times . first to atkins . then to pesco-lacto-vegetarianism . then to veganism . these aren ’ t really baby steps . i simply decided at some point to stop eating all animal products.because i am about to begin a more intensive exercise regimen with a personal trainer , i will have to add more protein and calories . likely beans and nuts . grain is great , but with my history of metabolic syndrome , i am trying to keep my intake to more modest levels for grain.it is funny that baby steps works for some people and dramatic lifestyle change works for others . when we have people who are admitted to our hospital for a heart attack who have smoked all their lives , sometimes it is a really teachable moment for them , and they literally quit smoking on the spot , never to start again , despite decades of daily tobacco consumption . i think people need to be scared to change their diets . the three things people fear are loss of their loved ones , loss of their health , and loss of financial security ( getting hit in their pocketbook ) .here is a great video why baby steps in terms of environmental impact and diet are not the way to go . via mcdougall seminar. https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = fws0f9s4bas & feature = youtu.betoxins : i haven ’ t had a chance to watch the video , but i wanted to comment about the general topic sooner rather than later : if it is a choice between baby steps and no steps ( status quo without any change ) , as was the case with me and many others , i have a hard time believing that anyone would argue that baby steps is not the way to go in some cases . i guess i ’ ll have to watch the video … : - ) the video is great , and very compelling . i hope you find the time to watch it.toxins : i finally got a chance to watch this video . i completely agree that is is a * great * video . i have long internalized this information and completely agree with everything the speaker says . except.except that the reality is that we live in a world where the vast majority of people just don ’ t get it . when surrounded by family , friends , doctors , government agencies , media , and our own long history all telling us to do unhealthy things ( unhealthy for our current selves and the planet and the survival of humanity ) , it can be extremely difficult for some people ( like myself ) to change dramatically from one day to the next . if , in that context , it takes someone say 6 to 12 months to make a change , that ’ s pretty darn good in my opinion . ( took me about 6-7 months to wean myself off dairy and eggs . ) perhaps one of the issues here is really our understanding of “ baby steps ” . as the speaker defines them , i agree that “ baby steps ” is just not going to work . if meetout monday were the sole level of ( type of ) change people are able to make for the foreseeable future , we are doomed . but if “ baby steps ” means more what i am thinking , in terms of a concerted effort that takes someone from sad to wfpb in a few months to a year , i think that is reasonable and the best of what you can expect with some types of people.if i were the ruler of the world , i would force a massive world-wide phase out of human consumption of meat , dairy and eggs . in that context , everyone would be working to make that happen . and in that context , the idea of “ baby steps ” would not be necessary – because even people like me would find it easy to make such a change in that context . but given where the world is right now , i just don ’ t think we can expect everyone to be able to drastically change their diet from one day to the next.that ’ s just my current thinking / response to the video and this discussion . i greatly appreciate you bringing this video to my attention ! i will definitely be sharing it with other people and i think it is a great high-level summary of one of the most important issues of our time.dgh : thanks for your comments . i totally agree with you concerning , “ it is funny that … ” it really is funny . while i admire people who work the way you do , i personally just do not seem to work that way.i also appreciate your comment about “ teachable moment ” . those kinds of life events really can make a difference for people . ( for those who survive and wish to avoid future events … ) thanks again for piping in . good luck with your new exercise routine ! sounds awesome.well , he ’ s doing more than preaching to the choir for those of us who are vegan . i appreciated being scientifically educated so that i may teach others as well.you might not be in the choir , but it sounds like you are in the congregation . i sympathize with your point of view to a certain extent , but there are some difficulties with pursuing the second voice . can you think of someone who would present that view ? it is a pretty polarized discussion paleo vs vegan . the science on both sides is a bit cherry picked . one of the problems is that if you ask most people they will tell you that they have a good diet . reading comments section in nytimes on a mark bittman article one sees moderation being stressed as the most important factor in dietary judgement . clearly with all the health problems in this country i think that moderate needs to be reset much further in the direction of whole plant foods . i haven ’ t seen much science to convince me that at best animal products should play more than a tiny part of anyone ’ s diet . i continue to thank and support dr. greger and his team for their work.so you ’ re basically asking the dr. to give you a reason to eat animal products . but the truth is that you shouldn ’ t . “ baby steps ” are not what he ’ s going for . there is no better meat . no not even grass fed organic . there is no better milk . he not here to baby people , he ’ s doing this to provide facts . it ’ s science not therapy.there are no studies that show that animal products increase lifespan and reduce chronic disease risk , they do the opposite as the abundance of evidence shows . dr. greger is not creating these studies , he ’ s drawing them from journals and showing them . the whole point of nf is to show people the evidence to prevent chronic disease and increase the quality of their health . dr. greger constantly brings about counter evidence , or evidence of the old paradigm , and shows how it is flawed in a very key way . 2 of the best examples of this are the bold study and how the renal acid load of meat does not affect bone health. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / bold-indeed-beef-lowers-cholesterol / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss / fyi – broken link : your link to the video “ higher quality may mean higher risk ” in the “ doctor ’ s note ” needs to be revised from : nutritionfacts.org : video : higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risktohttp : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk / thanks jonathan ! i just fixed it.interesting fact : we have more circulating antibodies against alpha-gal and neu5gc conjugated proteins ( 20 μg / ml ) than we have against a / b blood types ( 10 μg / ml ) .do even vegans have a similar concentrations of these two compounds ? i would assume than long term vegans would have little to no alpha gal since it would have been a long time since they last ate pork.antibody concentrations in vegans are little studied . one study of gluten-free vegan diets in rheumatoid arthritis patients found ~ 35 % reduction in antibodies against β-lactoglobulin ( from dairy ) , and 30 to 65 % reduction in antibodies against gliadin ( from wheat ) . so perhaps vegans have fewer of the anti-α galactose and anti-neu5gc antibodies as well.well , that ’ s a fascinating statistic.i admit almost total ignorance of glycobiology ( and immunology , for that matter ) , but i do find it fascinating that what we are talking about here is sugar molecules , chains thereof , and their linkages to protein molecules . in particular , here ’ s alpha-gal : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose and here ’ s neu5gc : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / n-glycolylneuraminic _ acidfor a crisp , yet approachable , introduction to chemical glycobiology , here ’ s a two-part lecture by carolyn bertozzi , a leading expert in this field . in particular , she describes the notion of blood types in relation to the chains of sugar molecules ( glycans ) that are attached to our red blood cells , and of the work being done to image glycans in real-time and for what purposes . part 1 : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = wcbg-koy _ 8e part 2 : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = g17qmtzoywcjust saw the two lectures , just damn interesting ! the only catch for me was when she explain how to stop white blood cell from the bloodstream to reach tissus with anti-inflammatory drugs , to stop inflammation ( part 1 at 36 : 58 ) . but wait , that is a normal and healthy process we evolved to protect us ! the reason why this procress is going out of control is because of pro-inflamatory factors from our environnment , not the lack of anti-inflammatory drugs , am i right ? hi adrien , what i understand ms. bertozzi saying is that it is normal for leukocytes to stick to the inside of the blood vessels within lymph nodes , but when this happens inside our blood vessels , it is among the first stages of atherosclerotic plaque formation , which is abnormal . perhaps you have seen dr. caldwell esselstyn present his iconic lecture on making oneself ‘ heart attack proof , ” by eating a low-fat wfpb diet ? when he says , “ things get sticky , ” what he is talking about is endothelial cell activation ( bad ) that begins the process of athersclerosis . honestly , i thought about this simple phrase for weeks and really wanted to understand what was going on here . i studied the literature ( as a layman and student of this material ) , and i attach links to papers that dig in deep ( pardon the pun ) and have satisfied my curiosity that i now understand what ‘ sticky ’ means . also , i ’ ll post a link to dr. esselstyn ’ s lecture to which i refer . have a great day ! http : / / circ.ahajournals.org / content / 108 / 16 / 1917.full.pdf + htmlhttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3209544 / pdf / ecc16077.pdfhttp : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = j6plrdawbw0thank you lawrence ! i can only guess that this process is also involved in atherosclerosis but i ’ m not sure that was ms bertozzi point . she talk about leucocytes doing damage once they reach the tissus , in auto-imune / inflamatory disease . thanks any way for your links , i guess a good reminder can ’ t be bad.so do you have to be bitten by the tick in order to have this reaction to meat ? could some people with autoimmune diseases have this problem without the bite ? this is a stretch , i know , but could this somehow explain why my thyroid medication dose has been cut in half since going vegan ? ( autoimmune disease ) i must say that by the title of this i thought it was going to be a cartoon of a superhero ( alpha gal ) , and a cowboy ( lone star tick ) : ) .no vegetables during radiation ! ? a very close 75 yr old friend long of sad diet was told by his oncologist that while receiving 30 days of radiation for his stage 7 prostate cancer , that he should avoid vegetables so as not to have any diarrhea of which he had a bit at the beginning of treatment . apparently diarrhea is common with this treatment . dr. gregger , is this a good idea given the circumstances ? the pt is a doctor , and trusts his ucsf oncologist . since some fruit is ok , we are making pink juice and black bean brownies for him . is there not another way to ward off diarrhea ? we had planned to regale him with green smoothies , but … is it only to prevent diarrhea or is it because anti-oxydant can interfere with the treatment ? i think dr greger said that this wasn ’ t true , but i can ’ t find the video , anybody ? i think you ’ ll be more efficient if you email dr greger directly . he used to answers every question here , but that wasn ’ t long before the website grew huge ! thank you , adrien for looking and for responding . it is wonderful to be part of this community ! how do i email dr. greger directly ? i would be happy to pay him . he must be so overwhelmed . if i could find something in peer-review print , my dear friend , a psychiatrist married to a super-famous immunologist might pay more attention.track down his comment in the comment section of this video , you ’ ll find what you need : ) http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / heterocyclic-amines-in-eggs-cheese-and-creatine / i think you should share this video with your friends , it ’ s about prostate cancer , it ’ s convincing and you can find the source cited at the bottom of the video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cancer-reversal-through-diet / i hope it might help.hi gayle , your friend is fortunate to have a supportive and well-meaning friend in you . my ‘ gut ’ tells me that soothing foods like oatmeal , rice pudding , pearled barley porridge , mashed potatoes , refined pasta and so forth with a balance of soluble fiber and water would be helpful to stabilize stool consistency and make going # 2 a # 1 experience . here ’ s some more ideas : http : / / www.oncologynutrition.org / erfc / eating-well-when-unwell / tips-for-managing-diarrhea-after-radiation-therapy-for-rectal-cancer / i also think that to go from sad to green smoothies might be too disruptive to the gut microbiome and may make things worse despite your best intentions to the contrary : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 24336217my best wishes to you and yours.thank you , very much , lawrence . finding the links is very kind of you.hi , i have a question about what the best diet is when you ’ ve been diagnosed with hashimoto ’ s ? there seems to be a lot of conflicting information , particularly around iodine ? i ’ ve been prescribed thyroxin for the rest of my life and would like to see if changing my diet could help to manage it – either to reduce my dosage or get off it completely. allergies , alpha-gal , animal products , animal protein , arthritis , autoimmune diseases , brain disease , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , cancer , crohn 's disease , evolution , farm animals , hormones , igf-1 , immune function , inflammation , insects , kidney disease , kidney health , kingdom , liver disease , liver health , lyme disease , meat , mushrooms , neu5gc , parasites , plant protein , pork , protein , saliva , stari , thyroid disease , thyroid health , tick bites our immune response against a foreign molecule present in animal products may play a role in some allergic , autoimmune , and inflammatory disorders . this reaction is thought to underlie tick bite triggered meat allergies . here ’ s some videos unearthing the igf-1 story : i wonder if alpha gal is playing a role in the improvements in arthritis and crohn ’ s on plant-based diets : dietary treatment of crohn ’ s disease and diet & rheumatoid arthritis.in my next video , tick bites , meat allergies , and chronic urticaria , i explore the role these tick-bite induced allergies may play in the development of chronic hives and other allergic skin reactions in children .
PLAIN-2609	treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets twenty patients with allergic eczema were placed on a vegetarian diet for two months , and their disease scores , covering both subjective and objective signs and symptoms , were cut in half , similar to what you see using one of our most powerful drugs . the drug worked much quicker , within about two weeks , but since side effects may include kidney failure and cancer , the drug is considered a class 1 carcinogen , making the dietary option more attractive , but this was no ordinary vegetarian diet . this was an in-patient study using an extremely calorically restricted diet — they were practically half fasting , so we don 't know which component was responsible for the therapeutic effect.what about using a more conventional plant-based diet against a different allergic disease , asthma ? evidently in sweden , there was an active health movement that claimed that a vegan diet could improve or cure asthma . bold claim , so in order to test this , a group of orthopedic surgeons at the university hospital followed a series of patients who were treated with a vegan regimen for one year . participants had to be willing to go completely plant-based and they had to have physician-verified asthma of at least a year 's duration that wasn 't getting better or even getting worse despite the best medical therapies available.they found quite a sick group to follow . thirty-five patients with long-established hospital-verified bronchial asthma , for an average duration of a dozen years . of the 35 patients , 20 had been admitted to the hospital for acute asthmatic attacks during the last two years . of these , one patient had received acute infusion therapy a total of 23 times during this period ( which is like an emergency intravenous ) and another patient claimed he had been to the hospital 100 times during his disease and on every occasion had evidently required such treatments . one patient even had a cardiac arrest during an asthma attack and had been brought back to life on a ventilator , so we 're talking some pretty serious cases.they were on up to eight different asthma medicines when they started . they were each on an average of four and a half drugs and still not getting better . twenty of the 35 were constantly using cortisone , which is a powerful steroid used in serious cases . so basically fairly advanced cases of the disease , more severe than the vegan practitioners were used to . still , how 'd they do ? eleven couldn 't stick to the diet for a year , but of the 24 that did , 71 % reported improvement at four months and 92 % at one year , and these were folks that had not improved at all over the previous year . concurrently with this improvement , the patients greatly reduced their consumption of medicine . four had completely given up their medication altogether , and only two weren 't able to at least drop their dose . they went from four and a half drugs down to 1.2 , and some were able to get off cortisone.some said that their improvement was so considerable that they felt like ” they had a new life . ” one nurse had difficulty at work because most of her co-workers were smokers , but after the year she could withstand the secondhand smoke without getting an attack , as well as tolerating other asthma triggers . others reported the same thing . where previously they could only live in a clean environment and then felt more or less isolated in their homes , they could now stay out without getting asthmatic attacks.and it wasn 't just subjective improvements . there was a significant improvement in a number of clinical variables , including most importantly , measures of lung function , vital capacity , forced expiratory volume , physical working capacity , as well as a significant drop in sed rate , and ige , which are allergy associated antibodies.bottom line , they started out with 35 patients who had suffered from serious asthma for an average of 12 years , all receiving long-term medication , 20 including cortisone , were subjected to vegan food for a year , and in almost all cases , medication was withdrawn or drastically reduced , and there was a significant decrease in asthma symptoms.despite the improved lung function tests and lab values , the placebo effect obviously can 't be discounted since there was no blinded control group , but the nice thing about a healthy diet is that there are only good side effects . their cholesterol significantly improved , their blood pressures got better , they lost 18 pounds , so from a medical standpoint , i figure why not give it a try ? thanks for this interesting video . “ treating asthma and eczema with plant-based diets ” i have my doubts about this placebo effect thing though . i understand this effect in the case of a sugar pill : your doctor is giving you the pills so this gives you the positive feeling that it works , which helps to heal better.but now in this case people are put on a vegan lifestyle . were they as positive about vegetables , and cutting out there beloved meats and dairy , as they would have been on taking pills ? if they were so positive on the vegan approach then why were they not vegans in the first place ? i suppose that the mind not only effects the healing process positively in a positive state , but allso effects the proces negativly when it is in a negative state.maybe we have to conclude that the vegan experiment worked out very positive despite the placebo effect ! martin van gastel norwaynot quite sure what your point is from first paragraph to the end , martin . are we talking about their beloved meat and dairy or your beloved meat and dairy ? ; - ) since only 1 % of the the us population , for example , are vegan , what are the statistical chances that they would be vegan already before the study ? not to mention that already being vegan would be a confounder that would likely disqualify them from participating in the study to begin with.are you attributing the objective variables to placebo ? somehow you are reading the exact opposite as what i meant . maybe my bad english is the reason here , but no , i wrote this from a vegan position.in my opinion people often try to downplay this kind of research with the placebo argument ( the placebo effect is the reason of the improving health effect not the diet ) . but i think this research had a positive outcome / health improving effect in spide off the possible negative placebo effect ( healing goes slower ) of the probably skeptical participants.i presume that the participants were not vegan , if they were vegen they wouldn ’ t be on this research at all . no , they are probably were missing there usual “ standard american diet ” and with this negatively affecting the research . but still the vegan approach is working ! martinthanks for the clarification . english is a tough language to wrestle . you ’ re doing great ! thanks for commenting . : - ) good point , martin . ( i understood your english just fine . ) it would have been good to interview each participant at the start to determine their attitudes toward a vegan diet , including having to do without their beloved animal products , as well as their expectations about how the vegan diet might affect their condition . if the average attitude was negative , that would tend to make one discount the placebo effect being responsible for the average positive outcome.in any case , we know that whether the placebo effect is partly to blame for the outcome or not , the therapy worked , and others can also expect it to work . the placebo effect is not a pretend effect . it is a real effect , it just has its roots in something other than the biochemical effect of the therapy one is trying to test . either way , the therapy worked . if studies show that for most people , when they have a positive expectation that healing will occur as a result of the ingestion of a placebo , the healing takes place , then that is a much better therapy than some side-effect-laden drug , even if there is no scientific reason the placebo in and of itself could have provided the healing . “ subjected to vegan food ? ” interesting turn of phrase . i ’ m subjected to loud noise , rude people , and the dentist . i relish vegan food ! : - ) i think i could told my experience … in few words i suffer practically of zero pathologies in my young life ( only 23 years old ) and sounds great uh ? nope because since 16-17 years old i start to suffer from atopic dermatitis and i could swear about god that i will never wish this disease to anyone … it is a nightmare that never ends … anyway putting aside the sad part of the story , one day i get interested in human nutrition and step by step i start to get informed and after some reading i chose the plant based diet road … what can i say : it works great … i need some more time because i live in a “ toxic ” environment ( ignorance is the main culprit ) but victory is near ! ! . wish me good luck ! ! ps i tried both corticosteroids and cyclosporine a ( neoral ) and of course they suppress everything ( no side effects in my case , thank god ) and gave temporary relief but curing your disease with a diet it is one hundred thousand times better … and about the toxic environment , well without it probably my health would have been recovered months ago … that ’ s great news merio . glad you are seeing . you will inspire others . i agree that ignorance is the worst “ toxin ” of all : ) when you vanquish that you don ’ t need luck ! but i wish you good luck anyway.thank you very much ! ! but the real tragedy is medical ignorance about diet and health ( my dermatologist was irritate when i ask if there was some diet connection but at that time i was at my first step about human nutrition ) … i really think there is some sort of agenda to make health professionals ignorant about this issue … my dr is similar . she is very supportive of my weight loss and good chems but becomes uncomfortable when i bring up nutrition … as if she knows she has to support whole plant food eating but her heart just is not in it . she always insists on checking b12 even though i tell her repeatedly that i take a supplement. and then its iron and calcium … and always the protein thing comes up . “ we need protein don ’ t we ? ” no , i say , we need good nutrition . there is more protein in broccoli than steak and she look at me like “ you crazy ? you flip your lid ? ” . maybe on the space station you need a protein pill and a fat pill and so on . but here on the good earth every dr must know by now that people need good food to be healthy.something seems very strange . you are in italy , i am in new zealand . our north american cousins hear the same line of stuff. so much of the world is in this strangle hold . who pulls the strings ? why ? can be a bit depressing to think about , questo dolce vita ; ) as a italian oncologist ( franco berrino ) told recently : if we get sick the gdp goes up , there is ( economic ) growth [ … ] we fail to understand that the best hospital is the “ closed ” hospital … and we forget also of “ primum non nocere ” … but i ’ m not afraid , thanks to people like dr greger , one day we will win and health would be restored in all the countries … count me in as one of the asthma sufferers who , on a vegan diet , was completely symptom-free . i began the vegan diet because of my husband . he had heart disease and read that a vegan diet is capable of reversing heart problems . so i did too . we both lost about 40 pounds , and i no longer suffer from asthma . i also am no longer on pain medication for arthritis . the only bad part of all this is learning to cook all over again , which isn ’ t that bad , really.marge , i love your story ! it reminds me of the early stories that pritikin published in his pritikin diet books back in the 1970s . i ’ d read about bedridden people in their 60s and 70s who were too sick to perform heart surgery on , so diet change was their only other option . with in months they were no longer bedridden and many went on to walk miles every day ; some even even “ ran ” marathon type races , even at their senor ages . and don ’ t forget the story of dr. gregor ’ s grandmother . i love these stories because they are so hopeful for ourselves and our loved ones , and are essentially without risk . btw , can you report any test results or symptom improvements for your husband ? how long have you been vegans ? we have been on the vegan diet 2 complete years , going on 3 with no plans to change . my husband is monitored regularly and recently underwent a stress test that he aced . he walks up and down hills rapidly daily with our lab , which he wasn ’ t able to do before . i know all this is anecdotal , but the proof is in the living.thanks for the follow up . great story with a beautiful ending . -mark g.thank you for sharing your story . did you and your husband find it hard to change your diet ? how did you decide to be “ vegan ” ? i have completely recovered from a life-time battle with asthma and allergies by adopting a whole foods , plant based diet . for most of my life i went through a ventolin inhaler every two weeks and more flovent and prednisone than you can imagine . no one in health care ever suggested nutritional intervention , until i had the good fortune of having brenda davis , r.d. as my nutrition instructor at wccmt in 1996 . it wasn ’ t until several years later , when my little boy showed signs of asthma that i actually dove in fully to a plant based diet ; having already given up meat , dairy was the last to go . within 3 days my son and i were asthma free.as asthma is such a common , debilitating , and costly malady , why aren ’ t there more rigorous studies going on everywhere to definitively corroborate the findings of this cited study ? wouldn ’ t you think that science and medicine would be all over possible solutions here ? ! the problem is the same with other pathologies : there is not financial benefit to research like this … you can ’ t patent a diet , but novel compounds … and add the “ double blind ” concept to the problems because you could not study a diet like a drug … true that , especially about the impossibility of blinding food . people like gary taubes and other low carber / paleos love playing their tunes in that confounder gap to discount studies like ornish and esselstyn.all the paleo lovers got to search for plantpositive site and the primitive nutrition series … bad times for them … good call.makes you wonder why non-profit asthma-organizations don ’ t fund some studies.well , it depends about the study you want to make … for statistical reason you want a good number of patients and follow them properly so you need a lot of money and most important what do you want to find ? i think it is not so easy to design a good study that hit the health community .. remember rapamycin , the mtor inhibiting compound with effects partially mimicked by lower-leucine plant based diets ? an analogue is approved for eczema . eczema , like cancer , atherosclerosis , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , scleroderma , acne ( i could go on ) appears to be exacerbated by the excessive growth signalling from western diets.i also have my story of suffering from astma and dermatitis . when i was 11 years old i decided do not eat butter , sugar , dairy , eggs and to be vegetarian . my health started to be better , i could run and swim , because astma i almost could not breathing during summer time . after i stopped to drink medicine and slowly , slowly , step by step became vegan . now i am 30 and i am running marathons , swimming and preparing to participate in iron man . that is my story … .nobody told me about plants and to be vegetarian , i just tried and trusted my intuition and my body.svetlana : it ’ s wonderful to hear about your success . congratulations on figuring it out , and the good sense to give what so people won ’ t . thanks for sharing your story and best wishes for a lifetime of good health . -mark g.firme recrutare personalfor those dealing with eczema while totally plant-based , my recent diagnosis might help.turns out i ’ m sensitive to nickel . allergist told me to go “ nickel-free ” with my diet ; which for the most part meant doing without my daily habit of a handful ( or 2 ) of walnuts or almonds . eczema i ’ ve been dealing with since 2009 has cleared up with that change.supposedly almonds and soy have nickel also . i still have almond milk with my daily breakfast cereal , but it ’ s still clearing up . but i ’ m now using mostly corn-based cereals ( natures path organic ) as supposed to those made of wheat ( another nickel source ) .try reducing nickel in your diet , see if it helps you too.you are correct that nuts are a source of nickel . it is always rewarding to read about success stories such as yours . congratulations . it is also nice to read about a physician who informs patients about nutritional approaches to chronic diseases such as eczema.lee : thanks for the tip . i eat walnuts and almonds every day and wheat on most days . i had horrible , bloody , cracked eczema skin on the bank of my knees every day for 20 years until i gave up soy ; then within 10 days it was all gone , and 5 years later has never returned . i still have a small patch on my face . i ’ ll try going wheat and nut free for a few days . i ’ d hate to give up all nuts , given their heart healthy properties . do you know if other nuts are lower in nickel ? -mark g.here ’ s a study on pubmed about nickel sensitivity and levels in various foods. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3667300 / that ’ s a good article . thanks for posting.my fiancee and i also ran into this issue . we went plant-based and both developed nickel sensitivity : mine shows up on my right foot , her on her hand . for us , we had to reduce almonds and we had to go easy on the “ chocolate ice cream ” ( pure cocoa powder blended with frozen berries ) as cocoa contains a ton of nickel , turns out . after that , we both noticed a clearing up of our skin issues.this is all such wonderful news ! i can ’ t wait to find out what the results of the trials of vegan on ms are when they come out , as the good doctor told us he is following.dr. mcdougall ’ s foundation funded the study on ms which is being done by oregon health and science in portland . dr. bourdette who is the lead author presented at the mcdougall advanced study weekend at the beginning of the study . he felt given the time course of the disease ( long ) and the short duration of the study ( 1 year ) plus the numbers involved it would be unlikely to show a significant result . he hoped the study will lead to a larger study . another physician involved with the study shared the nonms results . they were impressive as far as weight reduction , improved fasting glucoses and cholesterols . there are no downsides to the diet even if the effect on ms is small you don ’ t want to add another chronic disease such as diabetes , obesity or arterial disease on top of it.dr. forrester : re : ” he felt given the time course of the disease ( long ) and the short duration of the study ( 1 year ) plus the numbers involved it would be unlikely to show a significant result . ” i ’ m not sure i understand this . the above sentence sounds like conjecture. ie , “ his initial thoughts before the study were that bla bla bla . ” but my understanding is that we are a month away from when the results were going to be published . so , i would think we have the results now , even if they have not yet been published . we should be past conjecture . was he actually saying that the study does not in fact show a significant result ? or he was hinting that that would the be the ( disappointing ) conclusion ? or am i not understanding something ? i do understand the last part of your paragraph and think that is a significant point . i ’ m just wondering if you can clarify what you thought you heard about the effects on ms itself from the small study . : - ) thanks.hi thea , sorry for the confusion . let see if this helps . there were i believe 40 patients in the intervention group and 40 controls . the study lasted a year only . the time course of ms is over years . as i understand from the two presentations that i have heard historically it would often take well over 4 years to make a diagnosis due to the infrequent attacks . given small numbers in the study and long time frame it would be difficult to get statistically significant results . i ’ m hoping we will see significant results but don ’ t want folks to get their hopes up too high or if there isn ’ t a significant result to conclude that diet isn ’ t a factor . hope this provides a bit of clarity.dr. forrester : that helps a lot ! ! thanks for the clarification . i appreciate it . and it will help me understand the results when they do come out . thanks ! sweden still allows smoking in hospitals ( nurse whose asthma was aggravated by smoking co-workers ) .i have been vegan for 20 years and still have asthma – refuse to take the everyday medication but have a rescue inhaler – do not use it every day , but i know my breathing is compromised . your previous post mentioned eating seven servings each day – i think i should start counting – any other suggestions ? get off all gluten-grains immediately , and don ’ t even ingest these in minute amounts . also consider corn and barley avoidance . if you like grains , eat white rice , brown rice . but please , avoid gluten grains ! give it time . be patient.also , consider avoiding all spices . they are not “ foods ” that can provide for life . in some cases maybe they are “ healing ” , but seem to aggravate a lot of humans.avoid all soy products , no matter how it is prepared . no soy milk , soy beans , tofu , avoid it all . eat fresh veggies and fruit.and of course it depends on which medical standpoint we ’ re looking from : if their standpoint is to watch their patients get better then yes a vegan diet is the best way to practice . if , however , their standpoint is to make a lot of money then the vegan option would be the worst one ; because if they don ’ t have a sick patient they will not have a patient in their office and they won ’ t be able to afford to buy their meat they so love . it ’ s the american way . nice research paper find ! thanck youyup , the sickness industry thrives ! i was sent to dermatologist who had no interest in any of my ideas of food sensitivities or parasites , just writing scripts for cort.cream. i ’ ve been doing my own research / food eliminations for 2 years and the elimination list became very long . i ’ ve been going the vegan route for quite some time and had fairly good results . but i am dangerously underweight . any ideas how i can regain weight ? maybe lots of nut butters toothin ? ? ? great nutritional density and calorie density … almond butter comes to mind .. oh my … i need to not buy it ! lol ! toothin : good for you for figure out your own health path ! i know that lots of people want to lose weight , but being dangerously underweight is also a serious problem . i hope you are able to figure it out.to expand a bit on val ’ s idea : the way to gain weight is to eat more calorie dense foods . it sounds like you have eliminated a lot of foods , but hopefully some of these will work for you : nut and seed butters , avocados , dried fruits , and olives are all quite calorie-dense . you can make some really delicious nut “ cheeses ” that would be calorie dense and a pleasure to eat.while you may not be a teen and / or an athlete , i think the following page from the vegetarian resource group ( vrg ) has some great ideas and might be of help to you : http : / / www.vrg.org / teen / veg _ athlete _ weight _ gain.phphope that helps and good luck to you ! adding to thea ’ s excellent suggestions you want to make sure you are consuming adequate calories which on a vegetable and fruit based diet is a difficult . adding in enough complex carbs and not doing too much raw will help as well . cooking our foods increases caloric absorption by aiding digestion . if you are very active and exercise alot it can be a challenge . alot of my patients who think they are too thin are actually too thin compared to standard americans . best wishes.hello dr. greger . do you have any info on gingko ? my parents want to use it , but have read that the actual leaves contain harmful components and that extracts are better in this instance . surprisingly , i could not find anything on your site . did i miss something or is this a good idea for new videos ? : - ) may i please review what the hospitals served the patients – meals that were served ? i have heard about plant based diets for asthma treating for a while but have never seen an explanation about it . thiis will probably help our family get in a healthier shape.why mention placebo effect if the patients had been on several medications in the past and could have also easily have improved through the placebo effect ( although they didn ’ t ) . results are what matters and to have 92 % of people show improvement , many getting off medication , is amazing.i have noticed that my eczema which can get out of control ( even on a 100 % plant based diet ) is controlled when i drink nettle tea . i have also noticed my seasonal allergies are also mitigated by consuming nettle tea . what can you tell me about nettle tea along these lines ? i think i may have developed some eczema since becoming vegan . what ’ s up with that ? since aug 15 , 2014 i have not knowingly eaten more than a smidgen of anything not plant-based ( a roll here , a piece of bread there – really very little ) . since march of this year i have been on a low oil ( occasional dinners out – i do not cook with oil at all ) diet as well . yet i developed a strange looking rash that got scaly like the picture above . is my body driving out all the mean toxins or something ? also , my reactions to the bad air at work is more severe now rather than less . this seems to fly in the face of the evidence provided above . not that i am going back to animal products , but i am wondering why … i got my eczema on the backs of my hands following treatment of a cat claw infection / ringworm . i am also a vegan for some years . like many others , my eczema disappears in the summer and reappears in the winter . a product recommended by my dermatologist and made by mayo clinic personnel ( ? ) seems to help : vaniply . vanicream , made by the same company , does not seem to be as helpful . they also make a soap which i do use. asthma , blood pressure , caloric restriction , cancer , carcinogens , cholesterol , eczema , kidney disease , kidney function , kidney health , ldl cholesterol , lung disease , lung health , placebo effect , plant-based diets , side effects , smoking , steroids , sweden , vegans , vegetarians , weight loss pilot studies on treating allergic eczema and severe asthma with dietary interventions have shown remarkable results . if you missed the first three videos of this 4-part series here are the links : more on eczema and diet can be found in my videos : there are a number of other conditions plant-based diets have been found to be effective in treating :
PLAIN-2619	fully consensual heart disease treatment when he was a surgeon at the cleveland clinic , dr. caldwell esselstyn published a controversial paper in the american journal of cardiology . heart bypass operations carry significant risks , including the potential to cause further heart damage , stroke , and brain dysfunction . angioplasty isn ’ t much better , also carrying significant mortality and morbidity , and often doesn ’ t work , in terms of decreasing the risk of subsequent heart attack or death . so , it seems we have an enormous paradox . the disease that is the leading killer of men and women in western civilization is largely untreated . the benefits of the invasive procedures are at best temporary , with most patients eventually succumbing to their disease . in cancer we call that palliative care , where we just kind of throw up our hands , throw in the towel and give up actually trying to treat the disease . so why does this juggernaut of invasive procedures persist ? well one reason is that performing surgical interventions has the potential for enormous financial reward.that ’ s considered one of the barriers to the practice of preventive cardiology , adequate return : diet and lifestyle interventions lose money for the physician . although the practice of preventive cardiology is not as lucrative , this article was hoping to nudge cardiologists in that direction by appealing to less tangible benefits.another barrier is doctors don ’ t think patients want it . physician surveys show that doctors often don ’ t even bring up diet and lifestyle options , assuming that patients would prefer to be on cholesterol-lowering drugs every day for the rest of their lives . that may be true for some , but it ’ s up to the patient to decide.according to the official ama code of medical ethics , physicians are supposed to disclose all relevant medical information to patients . the patient ’ s right of self-decision can be effectively exercised only if the patient possesses enough information to enable an informed choice . the physician 's obligation is to present the medical facts accurately to the patient . for example , before starting someone at moderate risk on a cholesterol-lowering statin drug , a physician might ideally say something like “ you should know that for folks in your situation , the number of individuals who must be treated with a statin to prevent one death from a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke — is generally between 60 and 100 , which means that if i treated 60 people in your situation , 1 would benefit and 59 would not . as these numbers show , it is important for you to know that most of the people who take a statin will not benefit from doing so and , moreover , that statins can have side effects , such as muscle pain , liver damage , and upset stomach , even in people who do not benefit from the medication . i am giving you this information so that you can weigh the risks and benefits of drugs versus diet and then make an informed decision . ” yet how many physicians have these kinds of frank and open discussions with their patients ? non-disclosure of medical information by doctors , that kind of paternalism is supposed to be a thing of the past , but now physicians are supposed to honor informed consent , unless the patient is in a coma or something and its an emergency . but too many physicians continue to treat their patients as if they were unconscious.at the end of this long roundtable discussion on angioplasty and stents , the editor-in-chief of the american journal of cardiology reminded the participants of an important fact to place it all in context . atherosclerosis is due to high cholesterol , which is due to poor dietary choices , and so if we all existed on a plant-based diet , we would not have even needed this discussion . none of them ever mentioned a plant-based diet . not a peep . within two weeks of the treadmill test i was sliced and diced and wondering why i still had the angina . then they told me . because some of it was too deep to splice out . they knew that going in . the angiogram showed it . not a peep . pure greed.ever hear of a pump head ? the pump makes a fine foam in the blood . plugs up here and there all over . little clots . now i can ’ t remember phone numbers , appointments or the length of my shnozze.but a within a few weeks of wf / pb the angina was gone . so are the headaches , the joint pain , the ibs … so many gripes . i got a measure of life back . i could have skipped all the medical “ help ” . i didn ’ t know . oh darn.i like to watch people closely when i tell them that . its in their eyes … that little flicker . i can always pick it . wondering if they have the courage to believe . they know the odds already . they say “ i ’ m eating a lot less beef ” . poor sods . they just don ’ t know … we got the funk ! coacervate : i ’ m sorry you went through that . thank goodness you have something that works for you now . thank you so much for taking the time to write your story on this page . i think you may have shared some of this information in the past , but having it again on this page i think really helps make the point of the video . and hopefully will help others . thanks.if we all keep telling our stories we will help others avoid needless surgery , needless drugging . needless diabetes . helps me too to “ discharge ” .i saw this lack of informed consent first hand when my husband had a heart attack . he was herded into the cardiac protocol treatments and told he would be on drugs for the rest of his life at 53 . a couple of months later , he was talked into a second angiogram because something “ looked suspicious . ” i suspected that the doctor was allowed two angiograms per patient and nothing was really wrong . that was confirmed after the procedure . my husband has followed dr. mcdougall and dr. esselstyn ’ s programs since the heart attack , takes no drugs and has been healthy for the last ten years since the episode . i don ’ t know if he would even be here if he had followed his cardiologists recommendations … .. sad ! bb : so sad ! that kind of thing breaks my heart . i ’ m sorry your husband when through that . i ’ m glad he is on a good path now . best of luck to you both.odds are that he wouldn ’ t be here if he followed the cardiologist ’ s recommendation ! glad you found the best way to treat heart disease ! so my sister was talking to the cardiologist ( who had just put a stint in her husband ’ s heart ) about a vegan diet as her preferred treatment for heart disease . my sister can be rather passionate about this after her own diagnosis and recommendation for a stink the prior year . the cardiologist had the nerve to tell my sister to relax and have a steak for dinner . i guess he thought that was a funny thing to say in front of my bother in law as he recovered from his surgery . who does that ? i think these cardiologists , like your sister ’ s have convinced themselves that surgical procedures and advanced drugs are the way to go . it keeps the money pouring in and keeps their waiting rooms full of follow-up patients . his joke about eating a steak says it all . this treatment protocol is not only ineffective , it is insensitive.hey veganrunner.do remember to advice her it not only going vegan but also what you eat as a vegan . – greens in bulk ( magnesium & fiber to help flush cholesterol ) – whole grains – fiber – arucola – no – beets – no + better mitochondrial function with equal oxygen . not hard to conclude this effect will offer some added prevention of ( heart ) cells dying from lack of oxygen . – mushrooms – less sticky arterial walls – natto – moving out plaques – nuts – arginine and whatever else makes them protect your heart vs sudden death . – exercise.roll in , walk out after weeks wasn ’ t that the case ? anyway i ’ m sure you know but many probably won ’ t . did i forget one ? gl : ) “ they are there to provide the best possible care at the lowest possible cost . ” what country do you live in ? clearly , not in the usa inc . : -dno fruits ? damn lol most perfect food for our primate frugivore digestive system ~ https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = _ _ tb0ty0dtcwe produce more amylase than most primates . this gives us the ability to digest complex carbohydrates and starches as well . there are also two species of primates living in or near the arabian peninsula who also produce quite a bit of amylase . their diet consists of mostly seeds and grains . see http : / / huntgatherlove.com / content / grazing-primates # disqus _ threadinteresting primates species ~ cooked starch is second best after fruits and vegetables indeed since we need to cook starch because it is not really well digested raw or just in small quantity … veganrunner : wow . my jaw dropped reading your post . it ’ s the kind of story where you shake your head in bewilderment.hopefully things will get better in the future with the medical establishment . the participation of the great doctors and other health care professionals on this site gives me some encouragement.i ’ m with you thea . when my sister went through the treadmill stress test and called me with the recommendation that she have a stint i said , “ well i guess you need to give up all the animal products . ” but to do that she was really bucking her doctors recommendation . her general said it won ’ t help . the cardiologist he referred her to said , ” well it ’ s possible but it takes a few years . ” luckily i invited her to see dr greger when he came to town and he gave her the confidence she needed . most doctors feel so strongly that patients will be unable to stick to the low fat pbwf diet and exercise that is required to work . they should at least be given the choice.veganrunner : that ’ s a great story . good for you on inviting your sister to hear dr. greger . i totally relate to the need to have confidence that one is on the right track before one can make a diet change . i had needed a similar confidence boost before i was able to make the change from vegetarian to vegan . ( interestingly enough , i had no problems going from carnist to vegetarian . ) unfortunately , i don ’ t see medicine changing . it ’ s full steam ahead for genomics and individualized drug treatment . the money will keep rolling , while the bodies roll out ! this video strikes so many chords with me . so instead of ranting i will allow one to make their own conclusions . drawing conclusions as to how we treat our fellow human beings should start first with the hippocratic oath about the 4th century bc 2400 years ago . ( author ( s ) unknown ) . ( the whole interpretations “ classical ” and “ modern ” are in the link below ) http : / / www.pbs.org / wgbh / nova / body / hippocratic-oath-today.htmlhippocratic oath classical version ( excerpt ) : “ i will just relay the i will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment ; i will keep them from harm and injustice . ” “ whatever houses i may visit , i will come for the benefit of the sick , remaining free of all intentional injustice , of all mischief . . . ” hippocratic oath modern version ( excerpt ) : “ i will apply , for the benefit of the sick , all measures [ that ] are required , avoiding those twin traps of over-treatment and therapeutic nihilism . “ i will prevent disease whenever i can , for prevention is preferable to cure . ” “ i will remember that i do not treat a fever chart , a cancerous growth , but a sick human being , whose illness may affect the person ’ s family and economic stability . my responsibility includes these related problems , if i am to care adequately for the sick . ” “ i will remember that i remain a member of society , with special obligations to all my fellow human beings , those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm . ” dr. hemodynamic : thanks for this post ! i wasn ’ t aware that the hippogratic oath had a modern interpretation . duh . i just hadn ’ t thought of it before.the classic one , while explicit and enlightened on diet ( thanks ! ) , also appears however to be tilted toward the theists , anti-abortionists , and anti-assisted suicide proponents – not sure i can use it so much.yes times have surely changed but it is incredible to me how much was understood about treating the sick 2400 years ago with diet and the critical role the physician played as a patient confidant.unfortunately , those who need the guiding back don ’ t bother to read websites like dr. greger ’ s . they ’ re too busy proclaiming “ statins should be in everybody ’ s drinking water . ” and unfortunately how true that statement is because the new statin guidelines suggest millions more people ( soon to be patients ) should now be placed on statin ’ s that weren ’ t on them before . sad ! http : / / www.cbsnews.com / news / 13-million-more-americans-would-take-statins-if-new-guidelines-followed-study / i don ’ t get it . some reports say more will be on statins , other reports say some people on statins will be able to quit them . meanwhile , i haven ’ t actually been able to find the guidelines or the risk calculator with my iphone.hi macs , here you go this will cover it i think.http : / / www.cardiosource.org / news-media / publications / cardiology-magazine / 2013 / 11 / new-accaha-prevention-guidelines-address-blood-cholesterol-obesity.aspxhttps : / / circ.ahajournals.org / content / early / 2013 / 11 / 11 / 01.cir.0000437738.63853.7a.full.pdfhttp : / / healthaffairs.org / blog / 2013 / 12 / 24 / the-unintended-consequences-of-the-new-statin-guidelines / thanks , jacquie , information overload . i was thinking of a calculator where you input the pertinent variables , hit enter , and get an evaluation of options.is this what you ’ re looking for ? web version : http : / / tools.cardiosource.org / ascvd-risk-estimator / link for app version : https : / / itunes.apple.com / us / app / ascvd-risk-estimator / id808875968 ? mt = 8 & ign-mpt = uo % 3d2keep in mind if you ’ re a white male 65 years or older , a black male 64 years or older , or a black or white female 70 years or older , you will automatically be on statins regardless of how perfect your data looks . ( i.e. dr. esselstyn and his wife would be on statins ! ) and here ’ s a funny cartoon if you haven ’ t seen it : ) http : / / www.dailykos.com / story / 2013 / 11 / 20 / 1256784 / -cholesterol-overhaul # yup . that ’ s it.but it won ’ t let me tell the truth ! i don ’ t understand the de-emphasis on ldl goals . or the lack of a question about bmi or fat % body weight ? ( still working on those last stubborn pounds . ) . no question about family history , either ? but it looks like i ’ m in the clear according to this . but the tape measure and my family history and the fact that i had to add a little meat back into my diet tell me to keep working on myself.of course , with the ubiquitousness of cardiovascular disease and studies like the latest “ saturated fat is ok ” studies , what ’ s an overworked , confused physician to do ? hi macsmiley , just out of curiosity , why did you have to add a little meat back into your diet ? thanks , galefood sensitivities severely curtailed both the amount and variety of plants i can eat . try to get enough protein when you can ’ t eat enough plants . doesn ’ t work . i truly wish it were not a necessity . but it is . i eat as little as i can get away with . i poach a small portion 3 times a week to keep the carcinogens down.at least , dr. fuhrman ’ s books “ allow ” a little animal food . my lipids seem to confirm his position . at any rate , you gotta do what you gotta do to survive.have you tried some of the plant-based protein supplements ? there are soy , pea , hemp , etc.-based supplements out there . maybe one would work well for you so you don ’ t have to resort to meat.thanks for asking . the more concentrated the plant source , the more problematic.http : / / jacknorrisrd.com / oxalate-kind-of-a-big-deal / just posting the original article in case you or anyone wanted to read.1. the cardiosource link does have a nice summaries – if you scroll down. like 10 point summary , the link to calculator and infographic : http : / / bit.ly / 1mj5shy2 . the new guidelines are not sitting well with many – thus the calculator is being questioned as well for instance : “ dr. nissen entered the figures for a 60-year-old african-american man with no risk factors — total cholesterol of 150 , hdl ( the good cholesterol ) of 45 , systolic blood pressure of 125 — who was not a diabetic or a smoker . he ended up with a 10-year risk of 7.5 percent , meaning he should be taking cholesterol-lowering statins despite being in a seemingly low-risk group . ” http : / / nyti.ms / 1efcs5xhttp : / / b.globe.com / 1gw5yw3i plugged in gary taubes ’ s cholesterol numbers . that was fun . : -dps . all the cardiac risk calculators put too much stock in hdl.lol re : taubes ’ numbers . : ) the emphasis on hdl these days bugs me too.gotta love the last few paragraphs in that boston globe article ! ! : - ) wow , i have to say this is so maddening . my story is one of finding the whole food plant based diet after i had two drug eluding stents put in my circumflex . i asked the discharging cardiologist about diet and reversal and he did agree that the vegan diet could do it . after rehabbing for 4 weeks and starting to run again i noticed more pain when i ran and asked the cardiologist if something else could be wrong … he said no just take the drugs i have prescribed for the rest of you life and you will be fine . so i changed to the cardiologist that did my discharge and he ordered another angio. and this time the interventionist said i needed cabg . i asked my gp and the new cardiologist about diet again and they said it would take so long and i was at risk of dropping dead in the woods on a run … so i spoke to the heart surg. and he told me that i needed the bypasses because my blockages were in the forks of the arteries and could not be stented . so i had quintuple bypass 70 , 50 , 70 , 70 , and a 50 percent blocked arteries .. the wfpbd was not given any discussion time … although the cardiologist i had did say it would work but the surgery was what was best . i am not bitter about what i had done but it infuriates me to think that the medical community ignors such valuable info .. it is supposed to be health care not disease care . i did well bouncing back thanks in large part to the wfpbd and have given up all meds except a 10 mg simvastatin . i run 25 to 30 miles a week and just completed a 12k trail run this last saturday in the hills of the western nc mountains at a 8 : 57 pace . thanks to the nutrition facts staff and dr. greger for letting the truth be known … i know i preach it early and often to all around me .. btw my cardiologist did take the certification in plant based nutrition from e-cornell and colin campbell . the practice he is in also has started cooking classes that show a better way of treating the real reason for heart disease.thanks for sharing that ! this is exactly my story sans cabg . thanks to * real * dietary changes , i ’ m more likely to die from my stents ( restenosis ) than cad.recently told that i should add some fat every time i eat fruit , as it will help with my blood sugar and insulin resistance issues . if i eat fruit sugar ( i eat a lot of fruit ) without fat i am told that i could end up getting a limb amputated later in life . i thought fat was bad for people with insulin resistance issues ? really confusing stuff for me . i ’ d like to remain vegan and low-fat , but this is a concern . and i favor the fruit that is higher in fructose , such as apples and watermelons and dates . but does adding almonds or pecans every time i eat a couple apples really help one with these issues ? how ? it seems to me that the added fat to the sugar would make the issue worse in the long run .i always eat my fruit as part of a meal , all of which also include nuts / seeds and avocado apportioned between those 3 meals . therefore , i always end up eating some fat with my fruit.search dr. greger ’ s site for videos about nuts and seeds . there are a number of informative clips addressing various aspects of nut / seed / avocado consumption.do you know how the fat helps in anyway , as far as the fruit sugar issue ? fat helps slow down the digestion of sugar so it doesn ’ t hit all at once . can ’ t find the source of this info quickly.it averages out glycemic load , although fruit is not as high on the glycemic index as most people think.a little fat enhances absorption of micronutrients as well.the fiber in fruit slows the absorption of sugar- as long as you don ’ t chop up the fiber in a high speed blender.i would recommend eating fruits & fats separately . is it true that birds eat berries one day and bugs on another ? i ’ ve never heard that before.satch : usually when i hear of “ blood sugar and insulin resistance issues ” , i think “ diabetes ” or “ pre-diabetes ” . if you are talking about type 2 diabetes , then i think the book dr. neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes would be relevant to your question.it ’ s been a while since i read the book , but i don ’ t remember it mentioning a need to eat fat with fruit . i even did a quick skim of the recipes and found a fruit smoothie recipe recommended , with no added fat / nuts / etc . ( though it does have some protein powder . don ’ t know if that would be a key ingredient for the recipe in terms of what dr. barnard would recommend to a diabetic . ) in the meal plans , i saw breakfasts such as oatmeal cooked with apples . and wheatberry pancakes and fresh fruit . fresh fruit was also recommended as a dessert for one of the dinners.i would recommend checking out the above book to see if it can give you some general confidence in what a good diet would be for you . here ’ s a link if you are interested : http : / / www.amazon.com / neal-barnards-program-reversing-diabetes / dp / 1594868107 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ title _ 0 _ main ? s = books & ie = utf8 & qid = 1396382127 & sr = 1-1 & keywords = reverse + diabetesas for your questions about fat and how it might make diabetes worse , dr. barnard would certainly agree with you . that ’ s one more reason for you to read the book . it does a great job of addressing your questions.good luck.thea , i ’ m going to get the book . thank you . it seems to me that some vegans think they can ( i was one of them ) eat a lot of nuts and seeds and avocados each day , and not have it turn into a problem . i do think that this somehow caused my issues with sugar , sweets , and breads . i used to be able to eat these sweets and breads , now i struggle . i did read that large amounts of vegan omega 6 fats eaten each day , and consistently , can really screw up the liver and pancreas , and their ability to handle carbs . thanks again for the book suggestion.great. good luck . if the book ends up changing your eating habits , let us know how it goes . i ’ ll think good thoughts for you.over the years , as i slowly crept up to a bmi of nearly 45 , not a single one of my doctors ever even mentioned the “ o ” word . my endocrinologist did ask me at each appointment if i was still following a vegetarian diet , but he never inquired further . i was really a vegjunktarian , as dr. fuhrman would phrase it . if i hadn ’ t needed to move out of the tri-state ny area , and had thus been able to keep dr. fuhrman as my primary care physician , i never would have reached such a sad state of affairs unchallenged and uninformed.let ’ s hope the healthier plant-based changes i ’ ve made in the last 4 years , including dropping 100 + pounds , undoes any undiagnosed atherosclerosis , even if it doesn ’ t resolve all my health issues.what is the “ o ” word ? or you intended “ p ” word ? plants . plantae.o = obese , obesitythat is incredible that they wouldn ’ t mention it to you ! i wonder if doctors are now required or at least encouraged to discuss obesity with patients since the ama officially classified it as a disease last year.macsmiley : good for you for making those changes . sounds like it has been extremely beneficial for you . i really appreciate you sharing . your story is an inspiration.re : “ let ’ s hope … ” i ’ ll keep my fingers crossed for you . $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ and greed.some ( all ? ) hospitals serve unhealthy foods … ( there was a mcdonald ’ s to 1 i went to + sugar drinks , freely refillable ) .you , dr. greger , are free and give us free info on this free site . freeness is goodness . true thanks to you . “ all what is needed is a few dr. greger types but lawyers . : ) ” if dr. greger can be cloned , that will be epic . ‘ dr. greger ’ judge ‘ dr. greger ’ lawyer ‘ dr. greger ’ president.husband just got out of hospital . said he wanted vegan diet . he got a burnt toasted cheese sandwich ( the aid picked it up and said , “ even i wouldn ’ t eat this . ” ) , white flour thick mushroom soup , jello , brownie , fake whipped cream , etc . dumped it all and i had to bring food in.pathetic.excellent ! keep fighting the good fight , get the word out ! wfpb nutrition.i too have had a similar experience to many of the other commentators . i had some shortness of breath and shoulder pain so my doctor sent me to the cardiologist . the cardiologist did a treadmill test and found some mild irregularities . he then wanted to schedule me for an angiogram . he said the results of that would probably result in my need for statins . my brother and father ( both steak eaters ) are both on statins . i refuse . i am a vegetarian but have not been faithful to my vegan food choices . i am also in the obese category ( although only by a couple of pounds ) . when i discussed using diet and lifestyle as my preferred treatment my cardiologist became upset and doubtful that i could effectively treat my issues with this method . he too told me that i shouldn ’ t worry about the procedure nor the drugs , both were safe but that “ lifestyle changes are very hard ” . i agree they are hard in this society . but i consider the lifestyle choices of an invasive procedure and then lifetime of drugs to be much harder . give me greens and exercise any day . i no longer see that cardiologist but do see the inside of my gym daily . btw , the doctor never did a blood test until he was preparing to do the angiogram and at that point he did tell me that i was severely anemic . when i looked it up , it turns out that severe anemia can cause all of the symptoms that i had experienced . a simple blood test could have solved the problem rather than the very expensive set of tests he ran . a frank conversation would have been helpful as well . he never mentioned that i was obese as being a problem.spoday have you lost the weight ? if not i highly recommend dr fuhrmans ’ book eat for health . since you are already a vegetarian the transition should be easy.do you know of books dealing with plant foods for the brain ? ex : trained to much on wednesday and i still trouble in my sleep rhythm because it got so heavily disrupted the few days after . actually writing here on the site is already to stimulating for me . its really weird i know.arjan , give this a try : http : / / www.nealbarnard.org / books / brain / thank you lawrence , that ’ s very nice of you . downloaded ! i would also recommend the fabulous “ how to lose weight without losing your mind ” lecture by dr. lisle ! sometimes i wonder how many heart attacks are precipitated , i.e. unstable plaques are ruptured , by the extremes in blood pressure caused by stress tests and the poking around arteries by angiogram probes.although i must say intravenous ultrasound is absolutely fascinating.i ’ d be interested to hear your comments on this npr piece : http : / / www.npr.org / blogs / thesalt / 2014 / 03 / 31 / 295719579 / rethinking-fat-the-case-for-adding-some-into-your-diethttp : / / www.plantpositive.com / blog / 2014 / 3 / 23 / recent-articles-by-drs-chowdhury-and-dinicolantonio.htmlfact-checking isn ’ t what it used to be.remember that journalists are laypeople and can be just as easily confused as the general public , especially in this internet hit-centric environment we now get our information from.decades ago , doctors used to endorse cigarette brands and even prescribe smoking to patients . today , the dealers of death and disease promoting foods benefit from public confusion about the causes of heart disease . they are using obfuscating junk science and paid-off doctors to push their wares , just as the tobacco industry did in the past.keep in mind , the american public never actually followed a low fat diet . going back to saturated fats , which are proven to raise ldl but are not proven to save lives with increased hdl , will just lead us back to the peak heart attack years of the 50s and 60s.here ’ s what willett ’ s 1996 paper actually says : key messages • diets high in saturated fat and cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary disease , but these adverse effects are at least in part explained by their low fibre content and associations with other risk factors • diets high in linolenic acid ( n-3 fatty acid from plants ) are associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease , independently of other dietary and non-dietary risk factors • uncertainty remains on the optimal amount of polyunsaturated fat in the diet for prevention of coronary heart disease • benefits of reducing intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol are likely to be modest unless accompanied by an increased consumption of foods rich in fibrein other words , to get the most cardiac benefit from reducing saturated fat , one needs to increase foods rich in fiber , i.e. plants.unfortunately , the public will not get that part of the message , as long as even the great walter willett keeps dropping the word “ refined ” from in front of the word “ carbohydrate ” . they will just be easier prey for the low-carb vultures , slather on the butter and fry up the steak and eggs , pour on some olive oil and call it a mediterranean diet.yes macsmiley , if you listen closely the “ most of our carbohydrates are highly refined … ” ( mozaffarian ) “ americans took this as a green light to eat more refined grains such as breads , processed snack foods and white pasta . ” “ some fats , particularly plant-based fats , like olive oil and nuts , seem to have a beneficial effect … ” so listen closely , not new news . the damage comes when most people don ’ t listen carefully or closely.you do me a disservice . i listened correctly . the word refined was not used consistently to modify the word carbohydrate . in the printed article , the word carbohydrate is appears 8 times , carbs 7 times , grains 2 times . the word refined is used only 4 times and the word processed only once . that ’ s a ratio 17 to 5 . carbohydrate in one form or another is unmodified 12 times.might the uninformed get the idea that all carbs are bad ? absolutely , especially in the audio presentation . the point was not clearly made that unrefined carbohydrates are beneficial.oh macsmiley , i am agreeing with you . i was a response to the line of conversation . sorry for any confusion ! k , thanks . : - ) i think one of the biggest problems is that people do not recognize signs of disease . most , even if they could , would not understand the implications for their years to come.it requires a slight to moderate understanding of how things work . plus being able to seperate between aging and illness , is hard . it creeps up on a person , vascular disfunction , that is one of the biggest problems i think . people will only notice they are sick after they make changes , before they are just not aware and thus not prepared to invest time or effort.i ’ ve personally been very lucky in a way by being very sensitive to stress . the moment i stopped smoking apart from whatever else happend , stress went through the roof for 10 days and all of a sudden multiple symptoms of bad circulation presented itself those days . understood immediately that i had to act on it instantly . my limited understanding also makes quitting the new road impossible and thus processed foods have very little pull.i understand however this is not a common series of events amongst patients . wouldn ’ t it be prudent to device a test where a person undergoes a similar kind of process ? to show the patient the difference.a cold room with thermal imaging or something . or even a sight dose of vasoconstrictive medicine that can be immediately reversed after symptoms appear ? m.d ’ s ? seeing that heart disease is the number one killer we should all be aware that chances are we are heading down that road unless we make a conscious effort to do things differently . my father died at 52 from a massive heart attack . it would be beyond stupid for me to get fat , be a couch potato , and let time pass in a meat / fat induced coma.i thought i suspended that message above , dunno how a message i wrote can appear as guest.i live in austria / europe. the country with the highest amount of in-patient days in the world. none of my patients would ever quit drinking ( daily . 80 % of adults in austria do ) or change their diet. even mentioning the risks makes them highly upset and angry. i can totally relate to the practice of treating people as unconscious zombies and go straight for surgery – just as most doctors here do.you can ’ t be serious.nextposter : thanks for sharing.your comment sparked the following thought for me : as much as i ( generally ) personally see doctors having a responsibility of sharing all the relevant information regardless of expected recipient reaction , society in general also has to step up . if , for example , the media and government did a better job of educating people , then when doctors bring up these issues , the doctors would be talking to a more receptive audience . your job wouldn ’ t be as hard and the patients might have a better chance of actually being helped . just thinking here.good luck . i hope your future holds lots of enlightened patients.if elderly people do not listen out of principle they could be considered incompetent to pass short term judgement on what is best for their own health . and all decisions posponed for a few weeks.people could just be forced to do a 3 week diet before any planned surgery . no doubt this would help boost survival rates and lessen complications immediately anyhow . and after 3 weeks the knife might not even be needed anymore.in any case the whole of the western worlds economies are buckleling under the strain of health care . the more expensive healthcare gets the less can be invested in education and other social issues that do produce long term returns . its a vicious circle / vortex sucking up the worlds labour and monetairy resources . its a huge macro economical problem and can easily paralise entire countries.refusal to eat your greens when sick = act of economic terrorism towards ones own nation ! keep blasting that over the tv- sets in short but frequent bursts and let that nasty demon patriotism do your educational foot work for you ! another unique tool the u.s. still has next to claim culture ! flag waving went somewhat out of fashion over here 60 years ago , so we might need to think of a different way : ) we practice reactive medicine driven by big pharma and now big hospital corporations . 99 % of physicians have no knowledge of nutrition except for icu nutrition which has nothing to do with every-day nutrition . i offer dietary changes to all my patients . most accept it . others ( minority ) rather die than never eat bbq again. the best solution is for people to get educated … best response of the day ! and yet look at the “ news ” from npr : http : / / www.npr.org / blogs / thesalt / 2014 / 03 / 31 / 295719579 / rethinking-fat-the-case-for-adding-some-into-your-dieti was so confused about diet because of this sort of “ spin ” . it seems like the majority of people have a vague notion about nutrition but they don ’ t believe managing blood chems really matters . my gp still thinks 5 mm total cholesterol is good . this site is a rare “ candle in the darkness ” to quote carl sagen.i don ’ t get the mohl measurement . what is 5 mm converted to mg / dl ? about 200 mg / dlis there an equation ? the mm unit stands for “ millimolar ” , which is the number of millimoles of something per liter of solution . the unit m , without the milli , stands for “ molar ” , which would be the number of moles of something per unit of solution . a mole is a unit , similar to “ a dozen ” , except where a dozen equals 12 , a mole equals 6.022 * 10 ^ 23 . it allows chemists to take astronomically high numbers of things ( atoms , molecules , etc ) and reduce it down to manageable and calculable numbers . so rather than saying i ’ m making a solution of 6.022 * 10 ^ 23 molecules per liter , i can simply say i ’ m making a 1 “ molar ” , or 1 m , solution of that substance.so , you can take 6.022 * 10 ^ 23 of anything ( atoms , molecules , rubber duckies , marshmallows , etc ) , and measure the mass of that many of them . this mass value is referred to as the “ molar mass ” of _ _ _ _ . the units of molar mass are in grams per mol.if we were to measure the mass of 6.022 * 10 ^ 23 cholesterol molecules , the mass would be 386.65 g . so its molar mass is 386.65 g / mol.on to the conversion , this is your basic dimensional analysis . as an example , converting 5 mmol per liter ( 5 mm ) of cholesterol to its value in mg per deciliter ( mg / dl ) would go as follows below . multiply all the numerators by each other , divide by all of the denominator values , and cancel out any units that appear as both a numerator and a denominator ( since e.g. mol / mol or anything / anything = 1 ) : ( 1000 mg / 1 g ) * ( 386.65 g / 1 mol ) * ( 1 mol / 1000 mmol ) * ( 5 mmol / 1 l ) * ( 1 l / 10 dl ) * ( 1 dl ) the numerical value you should get is 193.33 , and after crossing out identical units , the only units remaining are mg in the numerator , and dl in the denominator , so the answer is 193.33 mg / dl.short answer : _ _ _ _ mm * 38.665 = your value in mg / dli hope this wasn ’ t patronizing . students ( i.e. college level chem students ) have a very hard time with the concept of moles . they try to make it into some mythical beast that is much harder to understand than it really is . i can ’ t help but have a fervent passion for spreading the good word about moles . for more fun with moles , please google “ a mole is a unit youtube ” . great song : ) glad i ’ m not the only one whose head is spinning . perhaps in the future you could do the conversion in advance like they do on food labels , just for us american laypeople ? looks like my ldl is 1.27 from your pov . tc is 2.82 . ( thank you , siri , for doing the math . energy conservation is really hard-wired , isn ’ t it ? ) cute video . i ’ ll share it here.http : / / youtu.be / pvt51m0ek5cfun video . thanks for the link.and thanks b00mer for the education and info about the video ! i ’ m feeling awfully ignorant right now as i don ’ t remember learning anything about moles before.while it surely seems like a really good idea , i think what you will find is that most people are looking for doctors to give them a pill . many have had years , if not decades , to read a health book , a few diet books , and watch some free online video ’ s about this . they can get blood work done . if they have high blood pressure , that is a warning sign , that something is wrong . again , they will look to the doctor for a fix.read the responses . they will act shocked now , when they had 30 to 50 years to look at a plant based diet . most of them will have trashed plant based diets till they end up in the hospital.people will usually only consider a plant based diet till after they get end up in the hospital.the medical profession has a diet that that is not working . so they are on the same diet as you . the medical diet has a 60 % population fat rate . most doctors i know are fat. think it is funny , when i got a nutritionist , who has to be 350 lbs , to tell me how to be healthy . “ dr. garrison added , “ you should also know that , for the average person with your medical history and state of health , the number needed to treat — that is , the number of individuals who must be treated with a statin to prevent one death from a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack or stroke — is generally between 60 and 100 , which means that if i treated 60 people in your situation , 1 would benefit and 59 would not . ” – this is a quote from the amajoe . so the 1 out of 60 benefit is taken from this article . do we have evidence that 1 out of 60 benefit is a science based number ? dr. esselstyn has always quoted a figure that statins help prevent mortality in 30 % of cases , leaving 70 % on meds still at risk of dying from their disease . that ’ s 3 out of 10 or 1 out of 3.33 persons . so i ’ m not understanding the 1 out of 60 number either.cleveland clinic demonstrated atherosclerotic plaque lesion regression with a particular statin at an 80 mg dose . perhaps raising statin dosages in general cardiac practice would up the percentage benefited . however , that would also increase the risk of adverse side effects.not encouraging whole food plant-based nutrition as the cure for this disease instead is a tragedy.i have been on a low fat vegan diet for a year , but my cholesterol numbers will not come down . any suggestions ? are you eating whole plants as grown or commercially processed vegan foods ? how is your weight ? do you eat nuts ? beans ? oats ( rolled or steel cut , not cheerios ) ? greens ? increase your fibers . eat more bulk.s noor : i ’ m not a doctor or expert , but i have some ideas for you.i remember a talk once where the speaker ( i think it was esselstyn , but can ’ t even swear to that at this point ) said that he suspected that some people ’ s bodies were so messed up from years and years of too much cholesterol that their bodies make too much even after they stop consuming cholesterol . i don ’ t think this was an established scientific fact ( just a true expert ’ s conjecture ) , and i may not even be remembering correctly , but it is something to think about . there may be a small percentage of people who have to take some cholesterol lowering drugs along with a plant based diet in order to get into the desired levels . maybe you are just an individual ? this would be something ot determine with your doctor . just a thought.another thought i had was : if you are overweight and as part of the last year , you are loosing weight , i wonder if that can keep ones cholesterol levels higher than desired . maybe things will get better when you are at your healthy weight . ( again , not an established scientific principle as far as i am aware – but it is worth thinking about . ) finally , while i don ’ t have easy links for you at the moment , dr. greger has highlighted special foods and classes of foods that have been shown to be especially helpful in lowering cholesterol . so , perhaps you could find those videos and then tweak your diet to include a great amount of those foods . this is really the best suggestion . being low fat vegan for a year is great ! ( really , it really and truly is ! ! ! ) but maybe you need special help , tweaking your diet for your special condition ? good luck.some great points , especially re weight loss lowering ldl levels . i recently found out from plant positive that is how low-carb diet studies get rigged , have the low-carbers eat fewer calories and make sure the low-fat group is not so low fat.macsmiley : thanks . i think plant positive is amazing . i appreciate you bringing him into the conversation.thanks for adding your two cents . i have been appreciating your recent comments in general on this site . thanks for the participation ! it is a little odd to me that dr. gregor did this video when he doesn ’ t agree with dr. esselstyn in his treatment of people . it would be great if dr. gregor would get on the same page with dr. esselstyn . i am someone who had been vegan for years , but still developed heart disease , it wasn ’ t until i read dr. esselstyn ’ s book that i understood that i needed to be on a diet that excluded things like nuts , avoccado , and other plant-based fats , and things like juces and smoothies. when i eliminated those my health changed drastically . even when i bring up my further restrictions people get very angry at me , when the way i eat is the way that doctors like dr. esselstyn , dr. campbell and dr. mcdougall are all agreeing on , and they are the doctors who have paved the way and have the results.hillarious ! ! watched mcdougall sell carbs and sugars like you wouldn ’ t believe and at the end 1 : 02 gets pestered about stevia and video ends.that is awesome editting with a solid joke at the end . had a good laugh ! http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / videos / free-electures / dr-mcdougall-criticizes-low-carb-diets / i ’ ve been thinking about your post over the week . i ’ d be interested in knowing more about your condition pre-heart attack : lipid panel , homocysteine levels , bmi or body fat percentage.i was a vegjunktarian for many years and imagine i laid my share of plaque during that time.as a md it is difficult not to be impressed by the work of esselstyn , ornish and others . everything else is scientific ignorance.i want to give a shout out to dr. stedman in marble falls tx . i am uninsured and went in to be treated for a broken foot . dr. stedman shared plant based diet info with me . talk about preventative care . i have only been eating plant base for two weeks but feel great ! just need my foot to heal . dr. stedman is the man ! thank you ! https : / / www.facebook.com / pages / the-family-wellness-center-pa / 162265320473475at 37 , i received 6 stents over three surgeries . some of my blockages were only around 50 % . not one cardiologist mentioned real dietary changes , just “ follow the aha diets ” – which i was already eating given my family history . my total cholesterol was only 183 on the day of the stents.now , i ’ m on a whole foods plant based diet , i feel much better & my numbers are better . i follow esselstyn ’ s diet recommendation.the kicker of this , i ’ m more likely to die from restenosis that actual cholesterol build up . drug eluting stents have a life time of around 20 years before the scar tissue closes them , and i have at least one of them in every major coronary artery . awesome – thanks doc.based on what i know now , i just needed a single stent , and that is what makes me angry.if you haven ’ t , check out dr. ornish ’ s web forum on plant-based nutrition and healthful eating ! share a post in the community that outlines your 2014 health journey and use the tag # isupport [ ben @ delabeaux ] meanwhile , the first study the first study to link fruit and vegetable consumption with all-cause , cancer and heart disease deaths in a nationally-representative population was just released.fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause , cancer and cvd mortality : analysis of health survey for england data7 + servings daily reduced all-cause mortality by 42 % compared to < 1 serving , vegetables had a stronger effect than fruit , and canned fruit were associated with more mortality.they lump frozen fruit with cooked ? ? ! ! = omust be to hide the true effects of bp ’ s natural gas on fruit while heating ! : ) i just read the abstract , don ’ t have access to the whole piece . i hope they weren ’ t conflating syrupy canned fruit cocktail with frozen unsweetened fruit.i suspect the issue is that ( if the uk is anything like the us ) the overwhelmingly most popular frozen vegetable is french fries , and canned fruit are mostly pie fillings.the article says “ … frozen / canned fruit consumption was apparently associated with increased mortality ( 1.17 ( 1.07 to 1.28 ) per portion ) . ” there is nothing about frozen vegetables.corrected. iwhy am i so stupid , sometimes ! i am a recent subscriber and have been watching your videos on youtube for some time . you push the plant-based diet very hard . that is fine but i have some questions . what would this plant-based diet look like ? what percentages of protein , carbs , and fat from calories would i be attempting to achieve ? what about entomophagy ? would entomophagy fall in the same category with animal proteins or maybe fall somewhere in between animal and plant protein because it is clean of hormones and pesticides ? my main concern is where all the protein is coming from and if it can be achieved without a very heavy carb load.carl : your questions / concerns are quite understandable . i ’ ll take a crack at trying to answer this for you.the easiest issue is to address is your protein concerns . here are my favorite sources which address the protein issue . after reading these articles , your mind will be much at ease concerning protein : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.html http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / newsletter / archives / ( check out december 2003 for mcdougall ’ s site , “ a brief history of protein : passion , social bigotry , rats , and enlightenment ” . also april 2007 , “ when friends ask : where do you get your protein ? ” ) you also asked , “ what would this plant-based diet look like ? what percentages of protein , carbs , and fat from calories would i be attempting to achieve ? ” in terms of percentages , especially of fat , you may find some differing of opinions . but what i think many people agree on is that if you generally eat a whole plant food based diet , full of veggies , fruit , intact grains , and legumes , plus a side of nuts and seeds , then you will automatically get the percentages that you need . but when people are first starting to eat healthy , this generalization is not so helpful , plus there is some fine-tuning that is needed.so , i first refer you to dr. greger ’ s recommendations for eating : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / that ’ s a great start , but is often not enough guidance for some people . so , i would encourage you to also think about the power plate from pcrm . this gives a very simple , easy to understand graphic of what a healthy diet might look like . roughly fill your plate with the 4 food groups as shown in the graphic . the only thing that i think dr. greger might add is a 1 to 2 ounce serving of nuts and seeds on the side. http : / / pcrm.org / health / diets / pplate / power-plateand also consider checking out the free 21 day kickstart program . they hold your hand for 21 days , giving you everything from grocery lists to meal plans to recipes to forums for discussion and support . by the time you got through 21 days , you would have a very good idea of “ what the diet looks like . ” http : / / support.pcrm.org / site / pageserver ? pagename = 21day _ vegan _ kickstart & jservsessionida003 = upegog3qg1.app234cfinally , to address your question about eating bugs , dr. greger does have a video about this some where . i * think * it was called something like , “ the healthiest _ _ ” animal ? meat ? i hope that when you finish reading the links i gave you about protein , you won ’ t see the need to eat insects . but if that seems important to you , dr. greger did address it.hope that helps.come on thea you are a nice girl but linking to a guy who claims vegetables hold more protein than meat or fish does ? really ? @ op : cronometer.com start filling out what you eat and start trimming to get decent values.arjan : i think the numbers speak for themselves . i ’ m glad you found the cronometer . i know a lot of people get a lot of value out of it.you cannot say protein content and then cite numbers of protein content percentage of total calories ! those are 2 totallly different things ! this bluejay guy is out to confuse and misinform ! hi arjan , most people calculate things by weight , because the food industry benefits from this . that ’ s how food with nearly all the calories coming from fat can be marketed as “ 99 % fat free ” , and beef which contains 33 % of its calories from fat can be marketed as “ 95 % lean ” . in the nutrition world , in terms of research and recommendations , percentage in terms of calories is nearly always used and is generally considered to be a more accurate representation.so broccoli is 27 % protein by calorie . i regularly have a big serving ( about 2 cups steamed ) , which provides 7.4 g of protein , which is 16 % of my rda . that ’ s 16 % of my rda from one side dish from one meal . not too shabby.i personally find percentages by calorie to be much more user-friendly . since all i have to know is 1 ) am i eating enough calories , and 2 ) is my overall percentage of calories from protein in my diet at least 10 percent . since i ’ m not a fruitarian , the answer to number 2 is always yes.thinking about serving sizes and adding up numbers of grams for each for each food i eat sounds like a lot more work imo.that is why grams and kilograms are so usefull instead of serving sizes and cups . all of a sudden 1 + 1 = 2 instead of 1 / 12 + 1 / 12 * 0.2854 = ? ? ? here in my country it just says how much fat is in it per 100gr and that will be it . anything else is just strange.and you are talking rda while you use a protein percentage guideline . this gets weirder and weirder . and who ’ s arbitrary rda guideline do you follow ? rda ’ s are no percentages right ? so percentages also limited by weight ? and how does that affect everything else you eat or can eat or all of a sudden can ’ t eat anymore because rda max has been reached ? this sounds like the single best way to start a wfpbd eating disorder to me . sorry m8 it really does.hi arjan , i ’ m having trouble understanding most of what you are saying , but i think i can respond to a couple points.regarding rda : most major nutritional and medical organizations agree on the same general protein requirements ; these are based on body weight . for a non-athlete , 0.7-0.8 g / kg body weight . so that is what i ’ m going by.i don ’ t stop eating when i get to the rda . most days i get about 150 % of my rda , and this is without making any effort to do so . i guess that was my point , that it is very difficult to not get enough protein . it seemed like that was the main aspect of this thread – how to get enough protein – not getting too much , which is an entirely different topic.i disagree about your eating disorder comment . my whole point is that i just eat whole foods , all day long , as much as i want , and i get plenty of protein . i don ’ t add up any grams and i don ’ t do any percentage calculations either.however it is precisely because of the percentage of calories from protein of various food groups that i know that * * it is impossible to not get enough * * that was my whole point . i don ’ t track protein . however , i can , retroactively perform the calculations to demonstrate that i get enough.here is how i track my protein to make sure i ’ m getting enough : make sure i eat enough food each day . if i ’ m still hungry , eat more . done.so where does that protein percentage of calories to live by come in ? so first , i have a general rda that i want to make sure i meet : ( 57 kg ) * ( 0.8 g / kg ) = 45 g protein needed per day.i eat about 1800-2000 calories per day . i don ’ t count them in order to limit them , but if i eat whole-foods plant-based , eat to satisfaction , and plug my food into cronometer , that ’ s just about what it ends up being.to know what percentage of those 1800-2000 calories need to come from protein ( in order to achieve 45 g ) , i take into account that there are 4 calories for every gram of protein : ( 45 g protein ) * ( 4 cal / g ) = 180 calthus i need 45 g of protein , or in other words , 180 calories of protein per day.180 cal / 1800 cal = 10 % so as long as at least 10 % of my calories come from protein in the diet , i will automatically get my 45g . the nice thing about this , is that since i know that vegetables , legumes , whole grains all average > 10 % , i know my overall average will be greater that 10 % . so i don ’ t even have to think about it . i just make sure i eat enough food.thank you for the well sourced response . i was up late last night going over everything you sent. along with getting sidetracked with other video on nutrition facts.carl : my pleasure. re : “ i was up late last night … ” oh dear , i hate to think i caused anyone to lose sleep . ; - ) thanks for the feedback ! i ’ m so glad i was helpful.the problem , i believe , is that physicians will never broadly recommend a plant-based diet because they themselves do not eat one . therefore , recommending one when they don ’ t themselves believe in it would cause too much cognitive dissonance . it ’ s like getting smoking cessation counseling from a two-pack-per-day surgeon with lung cancer . the vast majority of doctors are not vegans or even vegetarians , just like the vast majority of patients are not vegans or vegetarians . to believe otherwise is to live in a rarefied bubble . i don ’ t know what it ’ s going to take to get the message out there more . we are still inundated with incorrect nutritional health policy recommendations . people are talking about lean meat all the time ( chicken , fish ) . drs. macdougall , greger , esselstyn and ornish are standout professionals but they are relatively lone voices in the medical community . the recent lifestyle modification guidelines promulgated by the american heart association and the american college of cardiology , which directly deal with diets , don ’ t even mention vegetarianism . this is despite the fact that they include vegan search terms in their literature search strategies . they recommend the dash diet and the mediterranean diet . the mainstream medical community refuses to adopt vegetarianism.well said dgh . thanks.can ’ t do vegan … maybe because our palates are wired by the ( mostly new ) food culture ( i.e. fast , processed , western diets ) that habituate bad choices ( i.e. sugar , fat , salt ) . for starters , maybe too , it ’ s time to ban [ damn ] ‘ charlie and the chocolate factory ’ ( the sugar , not the chocolate ) , the candy holidays , and prohibit children from ‘ added sugar ’ use [ like a drug ] .are do ’ s better at nutrition than md ’ s ? osteopathic physicians stress holistic approach but do they use nutrition in treatment ? same thing happens with a cancer diagnosis . a 15 minute appointment , the shock of your life ( suicide rates skyrocket by 7x in the week after a cancer diagnosis ! ) , a quick referral ( weeks away ) to the surgeon , the chemo guy and the radiation guy . no mention whatsoever of the part vitamin d plays , low levels of selenium , sugar feeding the tumor , vitamin c , certainly not the biggest issue of all , b17 or laetrile which is still considered a joke even though its used in many countries now and should be offered at the patient ’ s discretion . not telling your patient about all their options for treatment should be grounds for a class action lawsuit , especially if in reality , the ama will label a quack any doctor who actually discusses these issues honestly . and the recommendations for chemo and radiation , both of which are carcinogenic in themselves , didn ’ t include any cost-benefit approach to cure rates , toxic side effects , none of that . i ’ m convinced more people are killed by cancer treatments themselves , than by the cancer which could most definitely respond to a dietary approach for the individual patient as well as society.something i ’ d like dr. greger to look into if he has time ; i read somewhere that the plant geneticist mendel spent a large amount of his time breeding the b17 out of fruits and vegetables , because it was bitter and people liked sweet . i wonder if this is true and if we have food bred now for much less of this important nutrient.this could be a big legal problem for cardiologists.i note that in abstract the authors state , “ we considered participants adherent if they eliminated dairy , fish , and meat , and added oil . ” but in the methods section , they say , “ initially the intervention avoided all added oils and processed foods that contain oils … ” do you know which oils were added and which were prohibited and why ? dr , esselstyn has a video on youtube – no , no no oil of any kind . the way he describes it – for six hours after consumption you assault your endothelial lining making it vulnerable . oil is a processed food , there is no good one.i started following dr. esselstyne ’ s diet one year ago , i lost 25 pounds , and noticed this thin layer of fat that was just under my skin all over my body has diminished , it is great actually , i always felt i had this extra padding like babies have , now it is gone , not to mention the cholesterol tests are getting much better as well . the only downside i had to fix all of my clothes to fit me , luckily i have a sewing machine to do that ! alternative medicine , ama , brain disease , cancer , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cholesterol , cleveland clinic , coma , complementary medicine , dr. caldwell esselstyn , heart disease , heart health , informed consent , ldl cholesterol , lifestyle medicine , liver disease , liver health , medical ethics , medical profession , medications , morbidity , mortality , muscle health , plant-based diets , side effects , statins , stroke , surgery , vegans , vegetarians when doctors withhold dietary treatment options from cardiac patients , they are violating the cornerstone of medical ethics , informed consent . the lack of nutrition training in medical school is another barrier . see , for example , my videos doctors ’ nutritional ignorance and doctors know less than they think about nutrition.for more on why doctors don ’ t make more dietary prescriptions , see my video the tomato effect , lifestyle medicine : treating the cause of disease , and convincing doctors to embrace lifestyle medicine.heart disease may be a choice . see cavities and coronaries : our choice and one in a thousand : ending the heart disease epidemic .
PLAIN-2629	dietary sources of alkylphenol endocrine disruptors there are many classes of endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants . concern about the alkylphenols first surfaced decades ago when a group at tufts observed an excessive proliferation of human breast cancer cells in certain types of plastic containers , something you 'd normally only see if the cells were exposed to some type of estrogen . they identified an alkylphenol as the culprit leaching from the plastic causing the estrogen-like properties when tested in the human breast tumor cells.that 's not good , so countries in europe started banning and restricting uses of these chemicals , but the u.s. epa has been slow to respond . a half million tons of these chemicals continue to be spewed out into the environment every year , so much so that now , they come down in the rain , and then accumulate up the food chain . so where in the japanese food supply can you find these potentially allergy-exacerbating endocrine disrupters ? predominantly chicken , and especially fish . water animals and birds concentrate these compounds to levels several thousands of times greater than those in the environment , because these are fat-soluble chemicals . therefore , they can easily contaminate foods of animal origin , which are thought to represent the most important source of human exposure to many organic pollutants , not just the alkylphenols . this group also found that fish was the worst.which kind of fish ? anchovies and mackerel in this study , and salmon and cod in this study . in fact salmon was the only food found contaminated with nonylphenol diethoxylate , which is even more potent than regular nonylphenol.and levels of contamination in fish were just the kind of concentrations that start to make breast cancer cells go crazy in vitro.these findings are consistent with the fact that seafood consumption has been associated with severe asthma , current and severe rhinoconjunctivitis , which is like seasonal pollen allergies , and current and severe eczema , an allergic-type disease of the skin , in adolescent populations around the globe.if these synthetic xenoestrogens are playing a role , what about natural phytoestrogens , like in soy foods ? turns out that in patients with asthma , consumption of a diet with moderate to high amounts of soy phytoestrogens is associated with better lung function and better asthma control , so if anything it 's more these chemical pollutants , which come down in the rain , contaminate the soil , the plants , but then concentrate up the food chain in the fat of animals . and we 're now like the ecosystem 's peak predator , like the polar bear or bald eagle.thankfully there aren 't many cannibals around anymore , though there is one group that continues to feed off human tissues . alkylphenols have been found to concentrate in human breast milk , particularly in women who eat fish . the highest levels of these endocrine-disrupting pollutants were recorded in milk samples from mothers who said they ate fish at least twice a week , consistent with the fact that seafood consumption represents an important source of alkylphenol intake . and even these slightly elevated levels of endocrine disrupters in the milk of mothers with a seafood-rich diet may be associated with adverse effects on neurological development , fetal and postnatal growth , and memory functions on breastfed infants , because these contaminants may interfere with the endocrine , or hormonal , system.or even worse , straight animal fat , such as chicken fat , lard , and tallow , which were considered cooking oils here , or fish oil . consumption of fish oil capsules and processed fish products was associated with alkylphenol concentration mother 's milk , again , thanks to bioaccumulation up the food chain . and then of course we recycle the leftover remains of farm animals into farm animal feed , and so the levels can get higher and higher in animal food products.as one commentator responded , yes , these pollutants contaminate human milk , but they contaminate cow ’ s milk as well — we live in the same polluted world . in fact infant formula was found over 5 times more contaminated , so breast is still best — absolutely , but these kinds of studies are important in order to provide good suggestions for food choices to nursing mothers to prevent excess exposure to these pollutants in their infants.we can kind of cut out the middlefish and move lower down the food chain in hopes of decreasing our exposure to industrial toxins . i ’ m so glad that i no longer eat fish … my kids were born in the eighties and back then i did eat as much fish and meat that i could afford … i thought it would make them smarter … hopefully things were safer then … and they are fine but now i worry about my grandchildren … . every body seems to want to attack any body that is a vegan … are we so programmed to think that we need to eat animals to be healthy ? thank you so much for all that you do .. you are to be admiredwhere do non meat eaters get their b12 ? beer , miso , or supplements.beer is not a source of b12 , nor is miso , sauerkraut or any other fermented plant food . yeast and lacotbacilli produce some compounds very similar to b12 , so in mass spectrometry it appears as if such foods contain significant amounts of b12 , but this pseudo “ b12 ″ has no vitamin function whatsoever . be wary of any suggestion that such foods would consitute be a reliable source of b12 for vegans . supplementation is the only way to go ! b12 ( a.k.a. cobalamin ) is actually not a vitamin like the other vitamins . it is a microbe ( bacteria ) that is produced by microorganisms internally ( synthesised in the gut ) and elsewhere ( e.g. in soil by microbes that live in a symbiotic relationship with plant roots ) . what something like sauerkraut is doing is aiding in creating an environment where these gut bacteria can thrive . alcohol can actually cause a b12 deficiency along with antibiotics ( taken directly or indirectly through consumption of milk or meat from animals that are fed antibiotics ) as they kill off these microorganisms.vitamin b12 is a microbe ? are you kidding me ! ? the b12 produced by bacteria in the large intestine is hardly absorbed at all ( b12 is absorbed in the small intestine ) . in the past the b12 from the feces contributed to dietary intake because of lacking hygiene ( e.g. wiping the a * * with the hand and then eating ) . i don ’ t think that is a desirable source of b12 , though . moreover , alcoholism does not lead to b12 deficiency , but to folate deficiency which may cause similar symptoms . last but not least , there are many good reasons to avoid factory farmed animal products , but residues of antibiotics in the meat or milk are generally not an issue.you should not spread such nonesense when you don ’ t really know what you are taking about.as i recall whzt dr. greger said was that b12 supplements and b12 fortified foods ( such as many cereals -check nutrition labels ) are the only reliable food sources of b12 for vegans . b12 is essential for good health.where do non meat eaters get their b12 other than supplements ? bk : fortified foods such as non-dairy milk and nutritional yeast can be a source of b12 for people who do not eat animals . dirty vegetables , dirty water and poor dental hygiene can also work , but modern humans have safer ways of getting their b12.it is also helpful to remember that people over 50 ( ? i think it was 50 ) are supposed to take a b12 supplement even if their diet includes copious amounts of meat.for more information : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 08 / 25 / vegan-b12-deficiency-putting-it-into-perspective / dirty streams don ’ t sound very appetizing do they thea ?

i doesn ’ t . then look at the graph at the end of the second video . formula milk , which is usually plant-based , shows higher level of alkyphenols than human breast milk . how does that fit with that cute graphic showing rising levels through the food chain ? it doesn ’ t . at finally a note about bisphenol a vs. soy isoflavones : they are not as different as suggested in this video . in fact , they show very similar selective estrogen receptor binding und consequentially very similar gene expression profiles . just look at this study : http : / / genome.cshlp.org / content / 22 / 11 / 2153.fulldoes that mean that soy isoflavones are dangerous , as some paleo preachers suggest ? no , it doesn ’ t , as we have plenty of epidemiological evidence for their safety . does it mean that bisphenol a is harmless or even healthy ? not necessarily so . it does mean that we need more evidence to come to sound conclusions . until then , indulging in ideologically motivated fearmongering is just as inappropriate as in dwelling in consumerist ingnorance.re : fish consumption : from the data in the previous video , during the years 1958-99 , rice consumption decreased 2.5x , meat consumption increased 7x , milk consumption increased 7x , and fish / shellfish consumption increased 1.25xit is only during the last interval ( 1989-99 ) that fish consumption decreased from its all time high at 105 g / day to 71 g / day , which is still higher than 56 g / day , the initial level reported in 1958.so it stands that consumption of all categories of animal products , including fish , has increased since 1958 , which is in line with the surge in allergies seen since the first case in 1964 to the present day rate of “ millions of cases / year ” ( quotation per dr. greger in previous video ) .even if fish consumption had actually decreased within the relevant time period , the magnitude of the increase in other animal products could still have possibly offset the decrease in fish consumption and still resulted in higher levels of phenol consumption . some sort of weighted analysis would need to be done to take into account amounts consumed and phenol concentrations of each food.re : formula : which formulas are you talking about when you state “ formula milk , which is usually plant-based [ … ] ” ? with a quick google search for infant formula , the seemingly major brands ( enfamil , similac , gerber ) all show dairy milk as their first or second ingredient in the majority of their formulations . the only exceptions i saw were for the specifically labelled “ soy-based ” option that each brand offers . other than that , they all seem to be milk-based.so , to conclude , you make three points regardling “ widely inconsistent fearmongering ” : point # 1 : dr. greger ’ s interpretation of the data you use in this point seems more relevantpoint # 2 : seems outright false , unless my quick and crude research into the infant formula world is in fact giving me skewed resultspoint # 3 : you present one source which makes you question the benefits / safety of isoflavones and the danger of bpa , then appear to answer your own question given the overall balance of evidence in both topics which you seem to be aware of , then seem flummoxed by the idea of making any conclusions about anything . i was unable to extract a cogent argument from this section to respond to.over 90 % of soy in the us is gmo . the only long-term study on gmo corn ( 2yrs ) by scientist seralini of france shows increased prevalence of cancerous tumors and shortened lifespan in rats . if you see mention of the editor ’ s retraction of that study online , look deeper and you will see that it is supposedly based on “ weak ” evidence . check out photos of the results and see if you think they are “ weak . ” further , note that a former monsanto scientist is now an associate editor on that journal . something rotten in the state of denmark here ? seralini is now fighting the retraction . “ over 90 % of soy in the us is gmo . ” the majority of this is fed to animals or found in processed food . the vast majority of soy-based products available are either labelled as organic or non-gmo certified . between all of the grocery stores i have access to , i literally could not buy gm tofu if i wanted to . even the processed soy based foods that are marketed to vegetarians / vegans e.g. faux meats , milks , etc are more often than not labelled as non-gmo . the fear of gmo soy may be a reason to avoid animal products or some processed foods , but would not factor into the decision to eat most soy-based foods.i ’ m a bit confused by this statement : “ water animals and birds concentrate these compounds to levels several thousands of times greater than those in the environment , because these are fat-soluble chemicals . ” if they ’ re fat soluble , then other foods high in fat – including land animals , their mammary secretions – would also concentrate them , as you point out . could you clarify why water animals and birds might be more problematic ? also , what source are you citing for this statement ? “ this group also found that fish was the worst . ” the fine print in the video is too tiny for my aging eyeslook at the “ sources cited ” under the video … for that graph you got to look the 5th study ( analysis of alkylphenol and bisphenol a in meat by accelerated solvent extraction and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry ) from the top … and what about nuts and seeds ? avocados ? surely they might be accumulated too ? glad i didn ’ t eat fish – or any other meats – during my pregnancies ! jonathan safran foer talks about our war on the oceans – overfishing . it is irresponsible for me to eat fish with knowledge of the environmental and ecological catastrophe on marine organisms that have been inflicted for the past 200 + years . others can do as they please ; i do not wish to promote the suffering of sentient beings ( “ hook , line and catch … ” ) very very interesting . i have had asthma my whole life . i have had excema my whole life . i am also allergic to shellfish ! ! ! ! i can eat fish , but not shell fish . also , my excema is quite controlled and i thought it was since i take krill oil ( good quality fish oil ) capsules … .they help a lot ! ! i do not use any topical steriods creams . thoughts on this from anyone ? this brings up so many questions for me ! ! i must know more ! it ’ s the chemical pollutants that are the concern . perhaps the krill oil you are using is less polluted . another issue is that it is not clear to me when the exposure to the chemical pollutants causes the problem . is it only when you are a fetus , infant , and / or child ? does the exposure matter as much as an adult if you are not breast feeding , pregnant , or planning to be pregnant ? i don ’ t know if these studies exist yet.avoid tomatoes and all nightshade plants . ( goji berries and possibly some of the other super-food berries marketed to us are also nightshades . ) consider going without citrus fruits . avoid all oils.also , endocrine disruptors appear to be widespread in all plastics including plastic food packaging such as pet , tritan , bps etc. and even more potent in some “ bpa-free ” plastics than in bpa plastic http : / / www.motherjones.com / environment / 2014 / 03 / tritan-certichem-eastman-bpa-free-plastic-safe – no more plastics in my kitchen ! it is interesting that japan has highest life expectancy in world and their main diet consist of fish … and also have a lower cancer rate then a large majority in the world , actually it is strange that many of the countries with lower rates cancer tend to eat lighter meats ie fish and poultry . not saying that this video doesn ’ t make interesting points , but , i don ’ t think it conclusive enough to say hey don ’ t eat fish cause it will give you cancer and other diseases.1. just because they eat fish , doesn ’ t mean they eat copious amounts of it . data from nutritional surveys show that the diet consumed in the 1970s , which is considered to show a traditional or pre-westernization diet , contained about 12-15 % protein . considering fish ( e.g. tuna ) is about 65 % protein , this indicates they fish wasn ’ t the basis of their diet , but rather something eaten sparingly . furthermore , that 12-15 % of their diet which is coming from protein , isn ’ t only coming from fish ; you have to reserve some of that percentage for all of the other foods in the diet which all contribute protein . for example , rice is 7-10 % protein , green leafy vegetables average 50 % protein , and tofu is 43 % protein . so the fact that they ate some fish does not translate to the concept that they ate lots of fish.2. it ’ s not just that they ate fish and had lower cancer rates , therefor fish doesn ’ t cause cancer . the fish they consume is within the context of a diet with broad spectrum chemotherapeutic activity : green tea , green vegetables , sea vegetables , soy , mushrooms , etc . you can think of it as another layer on the “ asian paradox ” , in which smoking is relatively common across asia , yet they see lower lung cancer rates than western countries.3. given how much in vitro data we have on the nasties in poultry and fish ( oncogenic viruses , industrial pollutants , heavy metals , endogenous carcinogens like polyaromatic hydrocarbons and herterocyclic amines , growth hormone promoting amino acid composition , saturated fat , etc ) , it isn ’ t logical to hypothesize that “ lighter meats ” are the reasons some cultures see some protection against certain cancers . what would be appropriate is the hypothesis that cultures eating lighter * amounts * of any meat see lower rates of cancer . and indeed that is what has been observed.b00mer : that ’ s such a quality reply . thanks for the great read and backing up your thoughts with data . this is one post that i ’ m going to keep . ( i was going to try to reply , but your response is way better than what i would have done . so , thanks again . ) well you are right in saying the japanese diet isn ’ t copious amount of fish although it is more then just sparingly and i say that from first hand experience as i visited japan for a couple months and fish ( well perhaps it better said seafood ) was quite regular . furthermore , i wasn ’ t making hypothesis on whether eating fish decreases cancer , or that industrial pollutants can ’ t cause harm . all i said that it was interesting that populations that eat lighter meats such as fish and poultry have a lower cancer rate . however , lets make things short and sweat the point i was making is quite simple eating fish and poultry on a regular basis will not give all these diseases this video suggests you will get . in other words i criticizing the fear mongering that this video contains.hi monopoly970 , did you visit japan in the 1970 ’ s or more recently ? the diet i ’ m describing is the “ traditional ” japanese diet , eaten prior to 1980 . as they have increased their consumption of animal products ( including fish ) , their rates of disease ( allergies as mentioned in this series , as well as heart disease and certain cancers ) have gone up.also , going by your logic that : “ eating fish and poultry on a regular basis will not give all these diseases ” , one could also say that smoking on a regular basis will not give all these diseases , since the japanese have lower rates of cancer despite their smoking habits . but , given the known carcinogen content in cigarettes , we know that this conclusion does not make sense . instead we form hypotheses about why they have lower lung cancer rates * despite * their tobacco consumption.education is not fear-mongering . critique is healthy , but the basis for your critique and subsequent conclusion ( i.e. that fish does not cause cancer ) is not logical , since you are not acknowledging two important factors : 1 ) amount of meat eaten in addition to type of meat eaten2 ) the majority of the diet being plant-based foods that provide well documented chemotherapeutic effectswell anyways as much i would like to continue trolling you with cooperate based research i am too lazy . i am gonna be honest i ’ ve read dr.vandenberg papers who is really one of the leads on this debates and it pretty obvious that endocrines disruptors can cause harm . however , you saying this is education is beyond me and shows that perhaps you need to review what education is … education is a presentation of both sides of the argument without making any personal judgments ( and there is another side of this debate argument it not very well established anymore , but a few legit criticism are there ) , not a single sided argument that consistently suggests that if continue to eat fish and poultry you ’ ll get diseases . you get the difference ? this video is a opinion that tries to fear monger not education.do you have any information as it relates to skin care products . we have developed an impressive skin and body care line that is certified free of estrogenic-activity chemicals and additional harsh ingredients . gmo-free , soy-free , corn-free . soy-free , packaging is bpa free . even the manufacturing facility is certified ea-free . its important that the consumers understand about endocrine disruptors , but i feel it is still a mental overload topic.first time i ’ m hearing this info . i have eczema and allergies and i ’ m always interested in the causes , how to overcome the condition and how to prevent it . i once wondered that it might be okay to take fish oil even if you ’ re plant based but seeing as how so much accumulates in animal fat in today ’ s polluted world , it ’ s not safe , especially if you susceptibilities for things , in this case , allergic conditions . i wish all mother ’ s would know info like this so they could prevent it in their children , when it ’ s severe it can be the worst thing to deal with for a kid.i see this discussion is about a year old , but i just had a comment to make that might be relevant to future related topics . i was reflecting on agricultural recycling of animal wastes , and your comments about feeding off humans — lactation.traditional practices in many cultures had the cooking and eating of the placenta ( human tissue ) after childbirth . it was often fed to the new mother — eating one ’ s own bodily tissues . assuming lactation prevented fertility until weaning , and the stair-step pattern of offspring , that mom may have eaten several of her own placentas in her reproductive lifetime . with the contaminants in our food supplies and environment , what risks / benefits might such a practice pose for the mother and her offspring as placental tissues recycle nutrients and modern environmental toxins back to the mother ? hello , dr. greger . i just read this statement from the natural health site , posted on msn.com : “ researchers at the university of southern california and the national university of singapore found that postmenopausal women who ate an average of 1.5 to 3 ounces of fish or shellfish daily were 26 % less likely to develop breast cancer during the 5 years of the study than those who ate less seafood . ” so does the consumption of fish prevent cancer , as is implied here , or contribute to it , as your videos suggest ? alkylphenols , allergies , anchovies , animal fat , asthma , biomagnification , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , breast milk , breastfeeding , cancer , chicken , cod liver oil , eczema , endocrine disruptors , epa , estrogen , europe , fat , fish , fish oil , hormones , industrial toxins , infants , japan , lard , lung disease , lung health , mackerel , memory , milk , persistent organic pollutants , phytoestrogens , plastic , poultry , pregnancy , salmon , seafood , soy , turkey , xenoestrogens foods of animal origin ( especially fish ) appear to be the most important source of human exposure to industrial pollutants such as alkylphenol xenoestrogens . see my last video alkylphenol endocrine disruptors and allergies for background on this class of xenoestrogens.endocrine disruptors have also been linked to conditions such as male infertility ( male fertility and diet and xenoestrogens and sperm counts ) and early onset of puberty ( protein , puberty , and pollutants and xenoestrogens and early puberty ) .what other industrial pollutants build up in the aquatic fish chain ? see , for example : farmed fish vs. wild caught . which is worse ? breast feeding is one way to offload toxins , but it is the wrong way to detox.how long to detox from fish before pregnancy ? if it ’ s too late , how fast can children detoxify from pcbs ?
PLAIN-2639	who determines if food additives are safe ? november 2013 , the u.s. food and drug administration announced their plans to all but eliminate trans fats from processed foods , citing a cdc statistic that the elimination of partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply could prevent more than 10,000 heart attacks and thousands of deaths every year . currently , trans fats enjoy so-called gras status : “ generally recognized as safe . ” how did these killer fats get labeled as safe ? who gets to determine it ? currently , a generally-recognized-as-safe determination is made when the manufacturer of a food substance evaluates the safety of the substance themselves and concludes that the use of the substance is safe . did i just read that right ? the company that manufactures the substance gets to determine if it is safe or not . this approach is commonly referred to as ‘ ‘ gras self- determination . ’ ’ to make matters worse , not only do they not have to inform the public , they don ’ t even have to inform the fda . in a footnote they explain that a company may voluntarily tell the fda they just came up with a new food additive that they ’ ve decided is safe , but are not required to do so.the cumulative result is that there are an estimated 6,000 current affirmative safety decisions which allow for more than an estimated 10,000 substances to be used in food . in addition , an estimated thousand manufacturer safety decisions are never reported to fda or the public . manufacturers and a trade association made the remaining decisions without fda review by concluding on their own that the substances that they themselves were selling were safe.while manufacturers are not required to notify the fda of a “ safe determination , ” sometimes they do notify the agency with a little fyi . the individuals that companies select to make these determinations may have financial conflicts of interest . at least in those cases , where they ’ re going public with their decision as to what they ’ re putting into our food , presumably they ’ re being above board and finding some independent third party panel . the objective of this study was to find out.what did they find ? of the 451 gras notifications voluntarily submitted to the fda , 22 % were made by someone directly employed by the company . 13 % were made by someone directly employed by a firm hand-picked by the company , and 64 % by a panel hand-picked by the corporation or the firm the corporation hired . are you doing the math ? yes , that means zero percent of safety decisions were made independently.an astonishing 100 % of the members of expert panels worked directly or indirectly for the companies that manufactured the food additive in question . 100 % . and those are just the ones the food companies let fda know about . and they used the same in-the-pocket rent-a-scentist “ experts ” over and over , leading food industry watchdog marion nestle to ask “ how is it possible that the fda permits manufacturers to decide for themselves whether their food additives are safe ? ” maybe it ’ s because many of the companies providing our daily food are corporate giants with political muscles national governments would envy . pepsico alone spent more than $ 9 million in a single year to lobby congress . the fact that food additives like trans fats have been allowed to kill thousands of americans year after year comes as less of a surprise to those who realize three of washington ’ s largest lobbying firms reportedly now work for the food industry . welcome to government of , for , and by the corporations . they even have personhood status now , thanks to the supreme court . in lincoln ’ s day it was government of , for , and by the people . progress , or not so much ? wondering if you have any thoughts on what specific foods can break down the blood brain barrier / weaken it , and which , if any , can build it back up . what effect does a high-fat diet have , and how about a high-glycemic diet ’ s effect ? i don ’ t have any “ industry made ” food items in my diet , but i do have mother nature made items and even some of these , in wrong quantities , combinations , maybe , … .. as well as spices … .cause the bb barrier to weaken ?

i have a similar problem with arthritis only it was gluten sensitivity . the pain was sufficient and the recommended treatment ( methotrexate ) so hideous that i have no inclination to eat gluten containing products . however i was also vitamin d deficient and when i corrected that i reduced the sensitivity . still had some residual symptoms so i went with a whole foods plant based diet thinking that animal have just too many pro inflammatory factors . indeed the arthritis is 100 % history . now my gluten sensitivity seems to be greatly lessened.stewart : that ’ s fascinating that going plant-based had an effect on your gluten sensitivity . good for you for making a ( difficult for some people ) change that improved your health.thanks for taking the time to share your story.i am wondering if the vitamin d was just a “ steroid like ” band aid for you . i have had experiences where vitamin d took away my issues , but if i stopped taking the d the issues came back . vitamin d is a steroid hormone , not a vitamin . can ’ t help but think that in peeps with autoimmune issues , the vitamin d does not get to the root of the problem , just puts a band aid on it.leslie , you are right that in your suspicion that vitamin d is not really a true vitamin . “ vitamin d is not technically a vitamin , ie , it is not an essential dietary factor ; rather , it is a prohormone produced photochemically in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol . the molecular structure of vitamin d is closely allied to that of classic steroid hormones ( eg , estradiol , cortisol , and aldosterone ) in that they have the same root cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene ring structure . ” ( anthony w norman in am j clin nutr august 2008 vol.88 no . 2 491s-499s ) . however , regardless of structure as a steroid or secosteroid , it is essential in human ( and indeed vertebrate ) health.there is a growing awareness of the ramifications of vitamin d deficiency . depending on geography and culture . at least half the world seems to be mildly to severely vitamin d deficient . in severe cases this can cause rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults . chronic insufficiency shows evidence of promoting immune system disorders , osteoporosis , dental problems , cancer et al.other than at far north latitudes in the winter , we can get adequate vitamin d with 10 to 20 minutes of sun a day . this much sun will give us 10 to 20,000 units of vitamin d . with today ’ s culture this is difficult for most of us ( except lifeguards ) . ( many years ago i might have gotten applause from neighbors for lying in the back yard nude . today i would probably get arrested . ) in any case with indoor jobs daily sunning is not done by most . so my levels of 25 ( oh ) d were extremely low when i developed arthritis . i was taking a supplement of 2,000 units per day but it was not enough . when taking 5,000 units per day ( according to the label ) my levels returned to normal and my gluten sensitivity was greatly reduced but not eliminated.while vitamin d is important , my point is that such things as arthritis are generally caused by a multiplicity of factors , all of which can have a major impact . i reduced the factors in my symptoms to three , but that enumeration is itself overly simplistic . a whole foods plant based diet is not a thing . it is a monumental system with an incredible range of phyto nutrients working in tandem with and sometimes against other things . gluten was provoking my immune system to be misdirected while others have enhanced and refined my system to work much more effectively . vitamin d is an important factor in this in itself but it should not be considered as an isolated factor . my point is that by addressing a wide range of things the food allergy might be mitigated or even eliminated.auto immune diseases are numerous and becoming more and more prevalent . this is extremely important to me as i have type 1 diabetes . type 1 diabetes is the type where your beta cells croak because of an auto immune response provoked by something and stop producing insulin altogether . this was called juvenile onset but now more and more adults are developing it . had i had adequate vitamin d levels and a plant based diet , i am convinced that i probably would not have developed this condition even eating wheat . all this just goes back to dr campbell ’ s point about “ reductionist reasoning and studies ” .addressing a single factor might help but will not solve the issues in most disease . but , we do not want to leave out single factors either . just put them in context and we might be able to work around them and enjoy an occasional tomato . .stewart , thank you for sharing your knowledge and understanding of this dynamic . what you say makes sense . vitamin d obviously helps many people , and their “ overall health status ” would greatly suffer without vitamin d being added to the diet via food or supplements . through my experience , and , apparently , some others , vitamin d can be counter-productive . when i get my vitamin d from the sun , my body reacts fine , no problems . when through supplements , i get tired , sick , rundown . i am convinced that in some people with autoimmune issues , vitamin d helps , and in some it hurts . for me it seems to suppress my immune system , leading to me getting sick . so it helps me in one area , hurts me in another . and , prior to supplementation , is was not deficient in d.best of luck to you with your health , and i ’ m jealous of your ability to now eat gluten . i wish my body allowed it.wow.i ’ ve seen enough of this type of information now to not really be surprised . but sometimes the audacity of humans who run these corporations makes it really hard for me to be compassionate.i imagine that there are still lots of people who remain ( purposefully ? ) ignorant of the food situation in america . it ’ s really helpful to have videos like this that we can point people to . thanks for doing it.i agree with you . it ’ s very difficult to practice compassion with people who are harming public health in the service of the almighty dollar . but the alternative – closing one ’ s heart – is even worse . keep one ’ s eyes open , don ’ t be a sucker , but still practice compassion when you can . actually , i find it ’ s the smaller circumstances that make it hard for me to practice compassion – what i call “ difficult encounters ” . a big corporation is a pretty abstract thing in my mind . : - ) dgh : re : the alternative being worse . ( sigh ) . of course , you are right.you have a very good outlook . given your job , you have lots of up close and personal encounters with a wide variety of people . i admire that you keep up the good fight without giving up – and while trying to stay compassionate . very impressive . thank goodness for doctors like you.i think it is helpful to understand the environment . most people who work for these companies do not make the leap between their decisions and the harm that they cause.our economic system has evolved so that these companies must do right by the share holders . that means more profit . if profit is the first concern , then health will naturally be the second . that means that the majority of decisions made will favour profit instead of health , so it is no surprise that the end products are extremely profitable and extremely unhealthy.so we have a situation where the consequences of these profit-centric decisions are so far away from reality ( sometimes different decades and continents ) – that any sort of human compassion has been removed . for me , that is the real threat of globalization – not the people who actually make those decisions.hypothetical question : if you were making decisions at a food manufacturer , would you have any motivation , other than benevolence , to avoid additives that made your customers sick ? there is no motivation other than profit , because the decisions made have no immediate effect . so yes , benevolence is the only factor – and even then , the share holders probably wouldn ’ t allow it ! the only reason we are seeing changes is as the public becomes more aware , the manufacturers have to turn to new practices to remain profitable . we see the same pattern across all marketing . the idea of low-fat and heart healthy foods has nothing to do with the companies apparent respect for the customers health ! here in italy , we are seeing a wave of ‘ no hydrogenated fats ’ labeling right now . a good thing yes – but not aimed at making anyone healthier ! best idea must be to avoid any food which has been subject to this human decision-making process – eg anything with a label ! “ as the public [ i.e. , the customer ] becomes more aware … ” exactly . a company that sells a product that makes its customers sick — where the customer knows the connection — will not be profitable , due to loss of sales.very true . the problem is the time lag between the product going out and the customers finding out exactly what these things do . makes resources like this website all the more important . thanks dr greger ! ! of course – this is really where regulatory agencies and governments should step in and evaluate the risk their citizens are being placed under . but with government and industry looking pretty similar , its up to us to make these judgments now . why didn ’ t i listen more to my chemistry and biology teachers ! ! ! off topic request – shingles , can you do a segment on prevention and treatment ? i am currently suffering tom a full blown case and have no idea of what i could be doing nutritionally . thank you.meditation is a useful tool . i believe many diseases are brought on by stress . stress has many forms – nutritionally , physically , mentally , emotionally . just 10 minutes at morning and night , be with your breath . make it a practice and see how life changes.hello nf team , this was an interesting video , i did share it with my friends , would it be possible to do a video or qa on nootropics or smart drugs / herbs ? i am going to university and these are increasingly beocming popular among students wishing to get an edge . the nootropics include natural herbs such as bacopa monnieri , rhodiola rosea , ashwagandha , but also synthesized drugs in the rectam family like pramiracetam and noopept.thanks for another great video ! sven : while dr. greger can ’ t reply to many posts , i do believe that he reads them all . when he sees requests like this , he keeps them in the back of his mind . that way , if relevant research comes up on the topic , dr. greger knows that there is interest in it.thanks for your comments.that explains a lot.dr. greger , thank you so much for doing this important work and bringing this information to the people . after reading slaughterhouse by gail eisnitz i concluded that the usda was a joke . after watching your videos i concluded that the fda , the animal products industry and doctor ’ s treatment of symptoms rather than causes was a joke too . thank you so much for making people aware.and it doesn ’ t stop at food additives ! – uk environment secretary owen paterson voted yes on the new pioneer gm maize , based purely on industry safety studies.he said ‘ science ’ has proved it safe – and gets this straight from the efsa , who examine industry studies to determine the safety . many efsa experts also have ties to the companies they ’ re supposed to be reviewing.what does this mean ? it means this new gm crop could be approved for cultivation in europe based on the opinion of one man who made his mind up based on industry studies . the uk vote is crucial in terms of weighting – they were one of 5 countries who said they ’ d vote for it , while 19 said they ’ d oppose it.and then theres the issue of publication bias . google ben goldacre – he does a great video on this . some studies have shown industry research to be 4 times as likely to favour the thing they ’ re testing – because industry can and does withhold negative results.it makes a mockery of our democracy ! is it true that orientals make their own b12 in their gut , and whites due to food availability and their love of meat and dairy , no longer can . if this is true what of other races ? all humans create b12 in the gut , but it is far too low to be absorbed . “ in one of the less appetizing but more brilliant experiments in the field of vitamin b12 metabolism in the 50 ’ s , sheila callender ( 7 ) in england delineated that human colon bacteria makes large amounts of vitamin b-12 . although the bacterial vitamin b-12 is not absorbed through the colon , it is active for humans . callendar studied vegan volunteers who had b-12 deficiency disease characterized by classes megaloblastic anemia . she collected 24-h stools , made water extracts of them , and fed the extracts to the patients , thereby curing their vitamin b-12 deficiency . ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 48 / 3 / 852.full.pdfwhat about the use of “ wax ” on apples to prolong their shelf life ?

PLAIN-2649	boosting the bioavailability of curcumin historians from all around the world have produced evidence to show that apparently all primitive peoples used herbs--often in a sophisticated way . quinine from cinchona bark was used to treat the symptoms of malaria long before the disease was identified and the raw ingredients of a common aspirin tablet have been a popular painkiller for far longer than we have had access to tablet-making machinery . indeed today many pharmacological classes of drugs include a natural product prototype , which we originally discovered through the study of traditional cures and folk knowledge of indigenous people.there 's a plant in south asia called adhatoda . adu meaning goat and thoda meaning not touch because it 's so bitter even the goats won 't eat it . but it has compounds that help open one 's airways , and as such adhatoda tea has been used traditionally to treat asthma where the leaves are steeped with black peppercorns . that sounds so gross to me , why would they do that ? because they 're smart . back in 1928 , scientists discovered what the people evidently already knew , which was that adding pepper increased the anti-asthmatic properties of the leaves . black pepper alone didn 't work , it was the combination . and now we know why.just like approximately 5 % of the spice turmeric is composed of an active compound called curcumin , about 5 % of black pepper by weight is this compound called piperine . curcumin is responsible for the yellow color of turmeric and piperine for the pungent flavor of pepper , and it 's a potent inhibitor of drug metabolism . one of the ways our liver gets rid of foreign substances is making them water soluble so they can be more easily excreted , but this black pepper molecule inhibits that process.and it doesn 't take much . if you give people a bunch of turmeric curcumin , within an hour you can see a little bump in the level in their blood stream . the reason we don 't see more is that our liver is actively trying to get rid of it , but what if you suppress that process by taking just a quarter teaspoon 's worth of black pepper ? then you see curcumin levels like this . same amount of curcumin consumed , but the bioavailability shoots up 2000 % . even just a little pinch of pepper — 1 / 20th of a teaspoon — can significantly boost levels . and guess what a common ingredient in curry powder is besides turmeric ? black pepper.another way to boost the absorption of curcumin is to consume it in the whole food , turmeric root ( fresh or dried ) , and powdered as turmeric because natural oils found in turmeric root and turmeric powder can enhance the bioavailability of curcumin 7 to 8 fold . when eaten with fat , curcumin can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream through the lymphatic system thereby in part bypassing the liver.and how is it prepared in india ? with fat and black pepper . amazing how they could figure that out without double blind trials , though maybe it just tasted good and was a coincidence ? their traditional knowledge certainly failed them with ghee , though , which is practically pure butter fat and may explain their relatively high rates of heart disease despite all their turmeric . great video ! but now i ’ m worrying about black pepper , hahaha . if it inhibits drug metabolism , what happens to toxic substances consumed along with black pepper ? ? i mean , we always have our liver trying to get rid of such compounds , right ? that ’ s an excellent question ! wish i had an excellent answer . possibly it might only be good to increase curcuim using the turmeric or with-fat methods . or have periods for a couple days where you do pepper and then let you body expel everything normally.i eat pepper every single day , in large doses ( i love it ) , and have for years . pepper is very good for you and excellent for your heart.cayenne pepper does not contain the piperine that is in black pepper . therefore it will not have the bioeffect that black pepper has . by the way , you need not take the curcumin and black pepper together . if you make tumeric tea , for example , the pepper you use in your cooking will suffice to have the pepper and tumeric act together . to learn more about this phenomenon see turmericforhealth ( . ) com . you will find some amazing information from an indian in india who has made it his life ’ s work to study ayurvedic medicine.take the curcumin with coconut oil instead of pepperine.shortest , but best answer here . coconut oil is brilliantdoes the cur cumin need to be combined with the black pepper or oil before consuming it ? yes you need the black pepper which contains piperine.yes to curcumin and coco ut oil . reducing the size ofmy breast lump.suz54 , have you continued to have success in reducing the size of your breast lump ? i am trying to do the same . what else are you doing ? thanks.i ’ ve heard that you should take curcumin with fat , but always with piperine . although coconut oil is great , you still need piperine.yeah sure , it ’ s probably the pepper on the steak and not the steak itself that ’ s harmful to your health … or at least that raises some interesting questions.great video on the bioavailability of curcumin , except for the very last part , which is biased by dr. gregers veganism . their traditional wisdom did not fail them on the ghee because there is evidence that saturated fats actually further increase the bioavailablity of curcumin , compared to unsaturated fats ( see http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23228631 this paper is about carotenoids but the same mechanism probably applies for curcumin as well ) . of course you can dissolve your turmeric in red palm oil instead of ghee , which provides the same benefits in bioavailability , plus plenty of carotenoids and tocotrionols ( a particularly beneficial form of vitamin e ) .see this recipe for a home-made vegan “ supplement ” based on turmeric and red palm oil : http : / / www.longecity.org / forum / topic / 67982-timars-polypulp / are you denying they have relatively high rates of heart disease , as the doctor stated at the end of this video ? it ’ s not as simple as that . the rate of heart disease , which once has been on a very low level in india , is on the rise since people have begun to adapt a more and more westernized diet with increasing amouts of meat and processed foods . ghee , on the other hand , has been an essential part of the traditional indian diet for thousands of years.are there areas of india that are not exposed to western foods ? i imagine so.yea i agree the last part of the article is off base. only recently in the last century have the indians switched from thousands of yrs of using ghee to using the industrial seed oils full of pufas and that ’ s probably more contributing factor to the rise in chdheart disease is not caused by saturated fat . if you still believe that you are living in the past , and even then it was known to be false by many.hi ben , unfortunately saturated fat is indeed still a strong marker for heart disease . please see here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail / its easier to consume 20-30 % more bioactive spice compounds to achieve a bioequivalent dose , than to get rid of the saturated fat and its effects on ldl transport and its inflammatory effects like intestinal endotoxin absorption , tlr4 activation , and metabolism to ceramides.saturated fats , of course , are not the only concern , as high linoleic acid in many vegetable oils gives rise to proinflammatory eicosanoids.in this study , ghee appeared non-significantly less harmful than sunflower oil ( 66 % la 0 % ala ) , but the clear winner was for cardioprotection was mustard oil ( 15 % la 6 % ala ) , the preferred cooking fat in bengali and nepalese cuisine . assuming the upregulation of the β-oxidation by the 42 % erucic acid in mustard oil isn ’ t the cardioprotective factor , perhaps canola oil ( 19 % la 9 % ala ) would be similarly cardioprotective , as it was in the lyon heart health study.also , hi timar.if red palm oil would only contain saturated fat and nothing else , i would agree with you . however , as i pointed out in the longecity topic , red palm oil is a really extraordinary source of carotenoids and tocotrienols , providing 5 mg and 8 mg respectively , per 10 g unrefined oil . given that carotenoids come in the most bioavailable form ( about ten times more biavailable than those from cooked vegetables ) , it is actually more than sufficient to consume about 5 g of red palm oil a day , an amount from which you still get a fair share of tocotrienols and which contains as little saturated fat as half an avocado . moreover , if you consume the palm oil the way suggested by my recipe , you even take additional advantage of that tiny amount of saturated fat to further increase the bioavailability of the turmeric contained in it.unless you eat no green and yellow vegetables or fruits , getting carotenoids is a no-brainer . better to get them in veggies than in a processed and potentially rancid tropical oil.no use in arguing with dogmatics … palm oil production and harvesting is devastating on the environment . surely there are better ways to get carotenoids.i doubt whether the production of the organic , fair-trade palm oil i buy is devastating the environment . moreover , by the very same reasoning you should avoid soy products , as industrial soy production is at least equally devastating to the environment . bottom point : you can ’ t just make sweeping conclusions about the environmental impacts of a certain food without differentiating by production quantity and quality . “ probably ” ? that ’ s some mighty fine sciencing there.if you ’ re interested in vitamin e , you could use wheat germ oil , the highest natural source of vitamin e. it ’ s the active ingredient in lipo-wheat ceramide capsules that they sell for younger looking skin even if there is a loss of absorbability , the article you reference , indicates the loss is only 20-30 % . because i ’ m a little crazy and i believe the stuff i read in life extension ’ s forum , i add a pinch of bht to my oil to act as preservative and antioxidant at the same time , while protecting from herpes and similar viruses.no , i ’ m not interested in vitamin e.however , i would strongly advice you not to you use bht at all . it is a synthetic antioxidant , which has been replaced even as an industrial food additive because of concerns regarding its toxicity . you are more than just “ a little crazy ” to put your trust in the obession of some crackpots populating the forum of a supplement company ( the same member there who is relentlessly writing about the purported benefits bht is also speading all sorts of paranoid right-wing conspiracy theories , from denying global warming to obama being a muslim who wants to destroy the usa … ) i pay no attention to ad hominen attacks . as for the toxicity of bht , see http : / / www.efsa.europa.eu / en / efsajournal / doc / 2588.pdfit ’ s a little troubling to me that by using this tactic we are deliberately bypassing the role of the liver . does anyone else find this troubling ? the liver is not a one trick pony . it has a whole range of strategies to eliminate stuff . if pepper stuffed up liver ’ s function so that it made people sicker instead of better then traditional medicine would probably detected that . instead this particular enzyme inhibition helps . this is one little phrase within the “ symphony ” that helps you hold onto curcumin a bit longer.what ? actually , the pepper dose does bypass all the “ liver tricks ” because the curcumin is getting through when it would otherwise be filtered , and the “ symphony ” is unbalanced to make this happen . that was the point of the video . my concern is that pepper may also allow other stuff to get through ? coacervate , you are putting a lot of trust in “ traditional medicine , ” whatever that is , to detect sub-clinical problems with pepper ingestion . most of them are still trying to find the magic bullet for every ailment , and they still discount food altogether for degenerative disease . and whoever edited my original comment did not preserve it ’ s message and did not do a service to your readers . it ’ s actually slander to edit my comment and post it as if from me . please stop.doctordave : re : ” and whoever edited my original comment … ” i ’ m not aware of any policy that allows people to edit other people ’ s comments . so , this should not have happened to you . i ’ m sorry this happened . i ’ m forwarding your post to nutritionfacts staff to investigate . but i don ’ t know if disqus keeps track of that level of information for us to be able to do anything about it . if you think that someone is modifying your posts again in the future , please let us know.so much good biochemstry here . you are a rare gem dr. g. but i am conflicted because i am in the “ no oil ” category , i.e. i ’ ve had a heart attack . but i want to break the rule enough to use oil to carry curcumin and other fat-soluble goodies across.question : does a little oil help our bodies absorb curcumin ? timars recipe , based on the dreaded palm oil for vegans sounds logical but all i can hear is essy ’ s voice “ no oil or there ’ s the door ! ” if you use a very modest amount ( 5.6 g as in the case of my recipe ) of a perfectly natural , unrefined oil , like red palm oil to greatly increase the bioavailability of turmeric you actually create or enhance a “ whole food ” synergy not unlike that present in whole food sources of fat , like nuts or avocados ( one suggested 15 g serving of my recipe contains about as much saturated fat as an ounce of almonds or one avocado ) but in this case providing an even more concentrated and powerful package of phytonutrients.there ’ s no doubt that one should avoid consuming large amounts of saturated fat , refined oils or fried foods , but there is simply no rational basis for drawing a line between healthy whole foods rich in fats , such as nuts and avocado , and dishes composed out of whole foods , like a salad with some extra virgin olive oil sprinkled over it in order to enhance the absorption of phytonutrients ( and to provide some valueable antioxidants on its own ) . dr. esselstyn ’ s “ no oil ” dogma is an exaggeration that is not based in science.there is fat in grains , veggies , fruits and legumes . just not a whole lot . but patients of ornish and esselstyn actually reversed heart disease on a regimen which kept fat to less than 10 % of daily caloric intake . that ’ s 22 grams of fat on a 2000 calorie diet . dr. mcdougall has been eating this way for decades and he looks healthy and well nourished . a little fat goes a long way.have you even read what i wrote ? yes i did . i think a few nuts or avocado is way healthier than oil , which is processed and stripped of almost all micronutrients . and i ’ ll admit i ’ m pulling your chain a little with the following , but jeff novick explains the bioavailability issue way better than i do : ” extracted oils are not “ necessary ” in salad dressings , nor are they a necessary component in a diet . oils are highly refined , highly concentrated , high calorie dense , low ( overall ) nutrient dense foods.it ’ s no surprise that when oil was added to some foods , the absorption rate of the lipid soluble component of the food ( i.e. , carotanoids ) increased . but , this doesn ’ t automatically mean that the oil is necessary or the increased absorption rate is better.however , if you had just added more of the original food , in the same calorie value as the added oil / fats , you would have ended up with even more total caratonoids . what i mean is that in one of the studies they used tomatoes and oil . they compared the absorbed amount from tomatoes without oil and from tomatoes with oil . but it wasnt a fair comparison . what they needed to do was to equal out the calories in both examples . if you compare a tomato ( lets say 22 calories ) to a tomato ( 22 calories ) with a tb of oil ( 120 calories ) , it ’ s not fair , because you added 120 calories to the second one . so , to even it out , they should compare what happens if you add 120 calories of more tomatoes to the first tomatoes vs. adding 120 calories of oil to the second tomato.1 tomato ( 22 calories , 3165 mcg lycopene , 552 mcg beta carotene ) i tb olive oil ( 120 calories , 0 mcg lycopene , 0 mcg beta carotene ) now , they say , add the oil to the tomato and the relative absorption of the lycopene and beta-carotene go up , maybe so.but , what if you just added 120 calories of more tomatoes ? eat about 5 more tomatoes . not only would you get about 17406 mcg of lycopene , and 3037 more mcg of beta carotene , you would also get 8 more grams of fiber , 6 more grams of protein , 68 mgs of calcium , 1,8 mgs of iron , 74 mgs of magnesium , 162 mg of phosphorus , 1603 mgs of potassium , 86 mg of vit c , etc etc even though the “ relative ” absorption may be slightly less , you still win on total absorption of the carotenoids and of everything else . plus you get more food , higher satiety and you dont get hungry . which fills you up more , 1 tb oil or 5 more tomatoes ? : ) besides , all plants including vegetables contain fat . maybe not as much as some high fat foods , but they range from around 5-15 % of calorie.a natural unrefined unprocessed whole foods plant based diet , provides enough fat.the notion that all oils are “ processed and stripped of almost all micronutrients ” is complete nonesense . extra virgine olive oil , just like red palm oil , is simply mechanically pressed from the whole fruit , essentially the same way today as in ancient times . it contains all the oil soluble micronutrients.it ’ s absolutely ridiculous to judge olive oil by its content of carotenoids . no one ever claimed that olive oil contains carotenoids ( however , one tablespoon of red palm oil contains 13,000 mcg of carotenoids … ) no , oil isn ’ t necessary to survive or even to thrive . however , a moderate amount of the right oils will not only enhance absorption of fat soluble micronutrients and provide health benefits its own but also make eating healthy so much more pleasurable.the problem here is that palm oil is not the right type of oil . palmitic acid , which is nearly 50 % of palm oil , cannot be seen as beneficial to one ’ s health.from the world health organization : saturated fatty acids raise total and low-density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , but individual fatty acids within this group , have different effects ( 3-5 ) . myristic and palmitic acids have the greatest effect and are abundant in diets rich in dairy products and meat . … the most effective replacement for saturated fatty acids in terms of coronary heart disease outcome are polyunsaturated fatty acids , especially linoleic acid . this finding is supported by the results of several large randomized clinical trials , in which replacement of saturated and trans fatty acids by polyunsaturated vegetable oils lowered coronary heart disease risk ( 6 ) .eat a cup a kale if you want beta lycopene , lutein or zeaxanthin ! i never suggested to make palm oil your main dietary staple . is is really so hard to comprehend that with nutrients we always deal with something called a “ dose response relationship ” and that nutrients which are dentrimental if consumed in excess are harmless or even beneficial if consumed in low enough amounts ? would you suggest not to eat nuts or avocados because they contain some palmitic acid ? i try to do everything i can to limit by total sfa ( saturated fatty acids ) intake . i realize that from what i already get in my diet — canola oil , nuts and seeds , etc , etc , etc — i am already getting enough sfa and do not wish to add further direct oils like red palm oil . i am already at a moderately high level for a vegan . i think that is the point that other commentators are trying to make here.saturated fats are not trans fats . from my review of the scientific literature ( paying close attention dose response relationships ) it is not necessary to “ do everything ” you can to limit your intake of them . anyone who consumes a vegan whole food diet using predominantly monounsaturated oils ( olive and canola ) should have plenty of room to add small amounts of saturated fat without any adverse health effects . moreover , whole foods ( red palm oil or olive oil are as close to a whole food as an oil can possibly get ) always come as packages . from the studies on tocotrienols and palmitic acid and their respective effects on cholesterol levels , red palm oil would provide a beneficial net effect on cholesterol levels ( the 8 mg of tocotrienols contained in one teaspoon of rpo are expected to lower ldl cholesterol to a greater extend than the 5 g of palmitic acid are expected to raise it , at least for non apoe4 carriers ) . given the non-linear dose reponse relationships for both nutrients , i would expect beneficial effects from small amounts of rpo ( < 10 g / day ) , less beneficial effects from moderate amounts and perhaps negative effects from very high amounts in the daily diet.my other concern is that consuming specific so-called “ health foods ” every day to achieve some long-term health goal on the basis of biomarker results is suspect . if that was the case , there would be no end of health foods that one would have to consume every 24 hours to be maximally healthy . that is why i dislike the term ‘ health foods ’ .if rpo has specific hard event data , please cite ; i would be very interested to see it . most likely what there is in the literature on the level of human hard event data is on the order of ecological studies – e.g. whole cultures that consume palm oil ( same as red palm oil ? ) have low rates of cardiovascular events , but there are myriad other influences as well.i said i try to reduce my sfa to as low as possible because the types of foods i prefer in my diet provide me with at least moderate amounts of sfa ( and other fats ) – for example , i consume tahini ( crushed sesame paste ) , hummus ( which is enriched with canola oil ) , nuts , pumpkin seeds , grains and very small amounts of olive oil . already i am getting far more sfa than i need , because of my preference for these foods . the kinds of diets that have been shown to produce extremely low rates of cardiovascular events were very low fat vegan diets.i ’ m tired of arguing with poeple who are unwilling or unable to comprehend what i actually wrote . i mentioned , very specifically , “ plenty of animal studies , showing protective effects and several human rcts ” and referened one such trial . i won ’ t compensate for your laziness . go to pubmed.org yourself and search for red palm oil . “ using predominantly unsaturated oils ( i.e. olive and canola ) ” i am not sold on olive oil . moderate amounts of olive oil are probably healthy , but in large quantities canola would probably be far healthier than olive.i would take anything the who says with a grain of salt if you are using fats to fuel your body as opposed to glucose , palm is a great choice . lots of mct oil for fuel and it does not cause denser ldl , excessive carbs ( glucose ) does i follow my patients lipid subfractions and when they swich off of polyunsats to sats and monos , they do better . polyunsats are not so great.polyunsaturated fats seem to me to be a bad category , lumping healthy canola oil together with unhealthy corn oil . what does “ they do better ” mean ? sorry , patients do better off all the unhealthy polysagain , what does “ they do better ” mean ? i stay the same healthy weight on 2000-2200 calories give or take . the majority of what i eat is starch – potatoes , sweet potatoes , corn , brown rice , whole grains . also a lot of green and yellow veggies and fruit , but you are right , calories need to be sufficient for energy use.oils have no fiber that whole foods do . fiber protects from absorption of these oils , just like fiber protects from absorption of sugar in fruit ( vs. fruit juice ) fiber does not slow down let alone diminish the absorption of oils . it only does slow down the absorption of carbohydrates.considering the endothelial impairment caused by olive oil , it does not seem to be beneficial for those consuming a low fat plant based diet. http : / / content.onlinejacc.org / cgi / content / full / 36 / 5 / 1455 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9409274 http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0735109706019127 a diet high in unsaturated fat is more beneficial then a diet high in saturated fat , but there is no necessity to consume extra fat if you are already consuming a very low fat diet comprised of plants . calories can come from whole food sources rather then an empty calorie food . yes there are some phytonutrients in olive oil , but miniscule when compared to other whole food sources . its like claiming eggs to be healthy because there is a presence of lutein . its the definition of reductionism.absorbing more of a nutrient does not automatically equate to better health , as is the case with b-carotene . “ these data , although in varying populations , suggest that 3 to 6 mg / day of β-carotene from food sources is prudent to maintain plasma β-carotene concentrations in the range associated with a lower risk of various chronic disease outcomes ” in addition , “ as just detailed , plasma and tissue concentrations of carotenoids have been associated with a variety of health outcomes ; that is , higher concentrations are associated with a lower risk of cancer , coronary heart disease , and all-cause mortality . this could be used as a possible indicator for establishing requirements for carotenoids . however , the limitation of this approach is that it is not clear whether observed health benefits are due to carotenoids per se or to other substances found in carotenoid-rich foods . thus , these data are suggestive of prudent intake levels , not required levels of intake . ” http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 9810 & page = 341thus , focusing on consuming a healthful dietary pattern rather then focusing on consuming a specific food , like oil , is more appropriate and applicable.moreover , populations that consume very low fat diets comprised primarily of plants have some of the best health outcomes and most desirable biomarkers.we ain ’ t riding that dead horse again , ain ’ t we ? ; ) its only because you refuse to acknowledge my points is it really dead . your bias is towards supporting an unhealthy habit in an unsubstantiated way . in one of the studies i presented , salad reduced fmd by 70 % so clearly olive oil alone is not a health promoting substance . i have never seen a study showing a diet high in olive oil supporting a diet very low in cholesterol , low enough to be considered “ heart attack proof ” . the fda has acknowledged the limitations of the benefits of olive oil , “ limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about 2 tablespoons ( 23 grams ) of olive oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the monounsaturated fat in olive oil . to achieve this possible benefit , olive oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day . ” so in other words , its not the olive oil , but the reduction of saturated fat. http : / / www.fda.gov / food / ingredientspackaginglabeling / labelingnutrition / ucm073992.htmdr. esselstyn is dealing with a population of patients whose arterial disease has become clinically significant . he is publishing the result of his long term follow up in an upcoming issue of jfp . it shows a terrific improvement over the courage study which had an annual recurrence of about 20 % . adding oil to a salad is one way to increase the absorption of phytonutrients the other would be to add some nuts / seeds / avocado . given the complexity of our metabolic and digestive systems i would be careful about advocating isolated nutrients . it is also very easy to pick out isolated metabolic pathways to justify the belief that a particular food is particularly good for us . the best diet should be tailored to an individuals goals . as the human population continues to grow it is also important to look at factors beyond the individual . dr. esselstyn ’ s approach is based on his experience and the very real and beneficial clinical outcomes of his patients.dr. esselstyn studies , while showing impressive results , do not allow for any conclusion regarding which factors in his comprehensive but uncontrolled lifestyle intervention program contribute to the outcome . dr. esselstyn has clearly left the territory of science with his assertion that any kind of oil is to be categorically avoided . it is no use arguing with a cult leader , to which dr. esselstyn has set himself up , or with his disciples in that respect.are they really uncontrolled ? i believe he quotes one cohort where the patients had 49 events in the 20 years preceding entry and only 1 event in the 20 years post-entry ( these numbers may be slightly off , but the message is clear , and when patients act as their own controls , this is a very powerful way to reduce selection bias and hidden confounding ) .sorry , but this is utter nonesense.coacervate , we too are “ no added fats ” vegans , but as with everything else , i see no reason why we can ’ t get plenty of the fats we need for increasing the bio-availability of curcumin ( and all the other things for which we require a tiny bit of daily fat ) from whole plant foods like avocados , olives , nuts , seeds … i plan to just enjoy a bit of those along with my turmeric-seasoned foods and / or beverages . ( i also have my own concerns about palm oil , namely the destruction of rainforests and orangutans ) .by the same logic you should have to be concerned about soy consumption . of course , those enormous amounts of soy for which the brazilian rain forests are destroyed , are not produced for the vegans eating their organic tofu , but for the meat industry . similarly , the enormous amounts of palm oil , which in its refined form is a cheap source of solid fat for the processed food industry as well as for many non-food applications are certainly not produced for the few health nuts eating small amounts of organic , red palm oil.thanks , i looked a bit deeper and find that you and dr forester are right … my diet has plenty of lipids , all i do now is have tumeric at the right time.regarding palm oil , i agree . my country is helping to drive this horror by feeding the waste products from this industry to livestock . we own about 20 percent ( or more ) of international trade in dairy and so facilitate this process and the knock on effects on wildlife and our own health.10 % oil is surely a lot healthier than 1 % oil even if you have excellent reasons to avoid 30 % oil.the indigenous people have the wisdom of the natural world . but how about the livers ability and wisdom to get rid of stuff that is not welcome in the body . maybe it is a sign that we should not to take turmeric in any form.please try to get at least a basic clue about metabolism and what the liver does before writing such a nonsensical comment … i don ’ t like to see insults . please try to be more understanding of other people and their quest for information . perhaps you could give a link on how the liver works . i am sure it would benefit us all.i second cckb ’ s comment . much of what you say is thought provoking , but change your tone ! how about telling us why , in a sentence , the liver is getting rid of a beneficial nutrient.more likely there are compounds that are “ like ” tumoric but less helpful and the liver is helping to get rid of those.another possibility would be that in the 24 hours after major injury , turmeric is bad for you and this had much larger survival indications 100,000 years ago than it does today . inflammation is probably far more aggressive in our bodies than it needs to be because of the .01 % of the time that inflammation can be a short term life or death matter.dear dr. g : enhanced bioavailability , curcumin ( or was it turmeric ?

while cayenne and paprika increase gut permeability , black pepper appears to reduce it . piperine ( the active component in black pepper ) also reduced transport in the study that cemented its role as cytochrome p450 inhibitor.are you saying that cayenne and paprika increase gut permeability of curcumin – or of other compounds as well ? is increasing gut permeability always a good thing ? couldn ’ t it lead to toxins flowing from the gut into the blood or being reabsorbed from the blood by the gut , too ? no , cayenne and paprika increased permeability of a intestinal celll monolayer to marked large dextrans ( starch like molecules ) in vitro , by interfering with the gap junctions between the cells.two different reactivity patterns were observed : paprika and cayenne pepper significantly decreased the ter and increased permeability for 10- , 20- and 40-kda dextrans but not for -70 kda dextrans . simultaneously , tight junctions exhibited a discontinuous pattern . applying extracts from black or green pepper , bay leaf or nutmeg increased the ter and macromolecular permeability remained low . immunofluorescence zo-1 staining was preserved.sorry , but i ’ m still confused . is the increased ability of certain starch-like molecules to permeate the intestinal cell a potentially harmful consequence ? “ leaky gut ” usually refers to the gaps between cells in the intestinal lining . these large dextrans are very bulky molecules , comparable in size to the 10-20 kda intact bacterial lipopolysaccharides ( endotoxins ) involved in post-prandial inflammation and sepsis , and pass into circulation mostly by infiltrating between cells of the intestinal lining . fluorescently marked dextrans of different known sizes were used in the experiment to determine how much the plant extracts influenced the tight junctions that glue cells together , preventing ingress through the gaps.i linked the article in response to rodica ’ s question . black pepper ’ s active component ( piperine ) appears to have no effect on gut permeability , but instead inactivates a liver p450 that metabolizes many beneficial phytochemicals like curcumin before they can reach systemic circulation.i don ’ t understand the consequences of these distinctions . help ! think of those numbers as the size of the holes in a colander . the larger the hole , the more likely a given type of pasta will slip through.the distinctions in that quote apply to the molecular weight of the starch-like dextrans , and as the the density of most starches and proteins are comparable , this provides a rough measure of how large a molecule might sneak past the gut ’ s enterocyte monolayer , as the density of most starches and protein are comparable . a dalton is the same as atomic weight , and as the average amino acid is about 100 daltons , and median mammalian protein around 375 amino acids long , the median mammalian protein is about 37 kda in weight . increasing permeability to 10-40 kda proteins lets down the city gate for a lot of unwanted material . endotoxin particles range from 10 kda up to 1000 kda for aggregates.the enterocytes that line the gut have some means of expelling unwanted compounds they absorb . also , compounds passing through enterocytes commonly wind up in the portal vein to the liver , where the hepatocytes can detoxify and expel unwanted compounds . however , if the cell adhesion proteins ( eg tight junctions ) that hold enterocytes together are disrupted , as may be the case when some foods are ingested according to the aforementioned paper , then any of the disolved detritus normally in the gut may bypass enterocytes . if they wind up in the portal vein , the liver will still conjugate and expel them , though with some potent inflammatory compounds ( like endotoxins ) this may result in chronic liver inflammation . if compounds from the gut pass into the intestinal lymphatics ( as most ingested fats do ) , then they ’ re likely to be distributed throughout the body.so , to summarize based on the article : “ the observation that solanaceae spices ( paprika , cayenne pepper ) increase permeability for ions and macromolecules might be of pathophysiological importance , particularly with respect to food allergy and intolerance . ” in other words , cayenne and paprika increase permiability of other compounds as well and this is possibly a problem if you are concerned about leaky gut . if i am reading it correctly.so we don ’ t want our guts to be permeable because leakage could trigger allergic or other adverse reactions , correct ? off-topic , i know , and i hope this is okay with dr. greger , but everyone should read this post from john and ocean robbins . and please submit a comment with your opinion to the government before it is too late.http : / / www.foodrevolution.org / blog / agent-orange-corn / wild ! so does this molecule in black-pepper inhibit liver metabolism of all fat soluble things ? like … if someone eats a steak with black pepper and fat-soluble “ bad things ” , does the black-pepper make the “ bad things ” more bio-available ? aside from animal products and conventional ( sprayed ) produce , what should we not eat with black-pepper ? good video , but bioperine is pretty old news . while it does provide an impressive spike in peak blood levels , those levels are pretty short-lived as shown in the graphs . science really has improved upon this : http : / / www.lef.org / magazine / mag2007 / oct2007 _ report _ curcumin _ 01.htmi ’ m a member of lef but we must always consider that lef stays alive by selling supplements . i prefer , whenever possible , to take nutrients the natural way if i can . for a good daily dose of curcumin , i mix 1 / 2 tsp tumeric powder with 1 / 2 tsp cayenne pepper , with juice of 1 / 2 fresh lemon and 1 / 2 glass of room temperature purified water every morning before breakfast . it ’ s a fiery concoction , so i chug-a-lug it down . after doing this for several years , my cardiologist commented that i had “ a very strong heart ! ” so , gentlemen and ladies , i give you an alternative method of consuming bio-available curcumin regularly , “ if you ’ re “ man ” enough . ” ( grin ) i went to your link on the life extension site . it read an awful like an advertisement for a patented product . not a source i take seriously . anyone have comment on this ? a most interesting discussion and appreciate all aspects . i very much appreciate for laloofah to raise the issue of destruction of jungles , loss of habitat of orangutans and other animals . we have alternatives and hope that others too will seek out less harmful options . i believe , overall , it comes down to the amount we consume ; in small doses , our body can digest everything.i believe you would be interested in the ted.com talk , willie smits restores a rainforest . it is an example of improving the environment , the lives of local people , social justice and saving alot of orangutans as well . we focus on health but there are environmental , social justice and the issue of suffering of other sentient animals that are important considerations.i dissolve a capsule of curcumin in 2 teaspoons of coconut oil to increase it bioavailability . i started taking curcumin this way and have continued taking curcumin this way instead of taking curcumin with pepperine because high doses of the concentrated pepperine can be toxic.what about heat treating the curcumin ? didn ’ t we learn from an earlier video that unheated turmeric doesn ’ t work ? or at least not nearly as effectively.dr g , you need to ask weather bioavailability of curcumin is important at all . the historical use of turmeric ( not curcumin ) in the diet is known to provide long term good health . turmeric as the whole spice is not used in mega doses by indians in their cooking . very little is needed and too much will spoil the taste of your dish . for therapeutic use , the whole herb is “ cooked ” in hot milk and taken as a tonic at bedtime . it is possible that the casein in the milk reacts with the polyphenols in the turmeric and forms a complex which arrives in the small and large intestines “ intact ” . i believe it is in the colon that the active ingredients in turmeric are “ active ” ! here ’ s my take : the microflora in the colon convert the polyphenols into smaller molecules which have a physiological action on the body . i think these molecules work similar to the short chain fatty acids such as butyric acid . perhaps as agonists for the gpr109a receptor ? this would explain why the turmeric works at very low doses . maybe you will dig up some articles for your next video on the niacin receptor and the benefits of polyphenols at low doses ? that was just raw curcumin by itself . by itself is loses its bioavailability . curcumin as part of the turmeric root is bioavailable because of the oils in the root . when curcumin is extracted from turmeric is loses the oils and its bioavailability . when turmeric is mixed with an oil it becomes totally bioavailable and bypasses the liver and goes into the bloodstream . i use coconut oil because oil its medium chain fatty acids are quickly burned and for because of its antiviral properties.what works synergistically with b12 to boost it ’ s effectiveness ? it doesn ’ t need anything . just make sure you take the right kind methylcobalamin.vitamin b-12 ( as methylcobalamin ) is available in patch form for greater absorbability . i apply a patch behind my ear every day.great video truly , dr. greger you are an inspiration to me.but why pick on ghee ? i do not have access to the 1987 article cited but the first two articles on ghee i found on pubmed conclude that ghee does not increase risk factors for heart disease : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15539276http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22131700also why is it so difficult to answer how curcumin is absorbed from consuming whole turmeric ? everyone seems to be researching bioavailability of curcumin after consuming only curcumin . guess i ’ ll have to dig a bit more.the study that mentioned curcumin + turmeric oil did provide some insight , but it ’ s still not whole turmeric , in powder or fresh root form.excellent debate — all of it . while some of you are trying to find the right combination to stay healthy , we radical cancer survivors look for “ chemo doses ” to keep aggressive cancers at bay : i have been using tumeric various ways mentioned to keep late stage ovarian cancer from a brca1 deletion from growing / metastasizing further in the lymph nodes for over 5 years . most recently , using the liquid supplement form from nc vitamins 2x / day with green tea , pomegranate concentrate and some form of cruciferous with my meals which contain a little coconut or olive oil fat , according to the recent uk double blind prostate cancer study — my ca125 inflammatory marker dropped ~ 20 % , from 10 to 7 , in a month , surprising my oncologist , who expected it to start climbing . i think cranberries in my smoothies may be preventing kidney stones . also , the tumeric-piperine combinations don ’ t feel as good in supplement form , but adding up tumeric to a soup or ayurvedic curry feels much better . so , while i am loving the ideas you all are giving me , try not to be too hard on yourselves , and with each other – there is truth in all you recommend — and physiology , biology and genetics is a dynamic process with our environment .it would be enormously helpful to have some guidance about dosing . mention is made of a quarter teaspoon of black pepper . no mention of the quantity of turmeric is made . it leaves me wondering if a tablespoon of turmeric with a quarter teaspoon of black pepper , daily on food , would get the job done ? i would guess that those levels would be near the upper limit . a teaspoon a day with pepper would likely be better than a tablespoon with pepper all around . it would be nice if people with joint pain could post effective doses for them , though . also look for the “ cooked vs uncooked ” discussion . a combination is “ better ” if you are willing to assume that more bio-availability is better.i make a lot of indian food , and now when i use individual spices i ’ ll be sure to add pepper . your bit about ghee at the end and high rates of heart disease in india surprised me . i believe that only the wealthy would use very much ghee at all and the vast percentage of the indian population is not wealthy . in fact , although it might have changed since i lived there , most food preparation used an equivalent of crisco rather than butterfat . ghee , spread on flat breads , or used to fry onions and spices that would be added to a lentil dish , was used in very small amounts . indians consume a lot of deep-fried snacks , and the sweets are very heavy in sugar and milk products . i should think there are reasons other than the use of ghee for the rate of heart disease in india.curcumin ’ s bioavaiability is impacted by both absorption into teh blood stream and then removal by the liver. as i understand piperine delays removal by the liver.fat helps with absorption.lipid encapsulation / nano formulations appear to provide greater bioavaiabilityi love your video but … aspirin , c9h8o4 , as the “ in ” indicates , is an alkaloid coming from an extraction and , do i not remember correctly to state that it was first created by reaction with coal tar ? it is not equal to salicylic acid c7h6o3 , which is found in nature.i was wrong of course , it was the acetyle group who did it to the coal tar , never the less- it is synthetic and has totally different properties than anything found in nature.so if someone was on cancer drugs would adding black pepper to a meal with curry be a good idea or bad idea ? could we please have a straight answer on the safe daily dosage of turmeric powder ? i add a little pepper with my daily turmeric , but how can i eat it with a healthy fat to boost bioavailability ? it seems that processed / extracted oils are bad , and coconut oil should only be eaten sparingly ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-coconut-oil-good-for-you / ) according to dr. g. i can only eat so many avocadoes . what is the best way to improve curcumin absorption on top of black pepper , i.e. what is the best type of fat to eat with it ? i was doing coconut milk yogurt for fat and probiotics , but that also doesn ’ t seem ideal ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-coconut-milk-good-for-you / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / what-is-a-good-source-of-probiotics / ) . please help ! ! cheryl : how about eating it with some whole nuts ? it ’ s probably a good idea for most people to eat an ounce or two of nuts a day anyway . maybe find a way to combine your nut eating with your turmeric eating ? i wonder how turmeric and peanut butter mixed together would taste ? ? ? : -0or maybe you could eat the turmeric ( with some black pepper ) in some capsules like some people are doing , and then eat a few walnuts right after . so , it would all mix in your tummy at the same time . i would think.just some ideas for you.great idea ! for some reason i was thinking that it must be mixed with a liquid , eating nuts totally makes sense.ok , i ’ m a bit confused … if you take curcumin as turmeric ( either the root or the powder ) you don ’ t need to add black pepper or a fat to increase bioavailability ? is this correct ? as i understand it , curcumin alone would need black pepper or fat to increase the bioavailability but turmeric does not ( as it already has natural fats ) ? am i right in my thoughts here ? not sure how on earth you ’ d just ingest curcumin alone ( ie not as turmeric ) – unless in supplement form … hello – i ’ m a tad confused . i ’ m sure there ’ s a simple answer , but i just can ’ t come to the conclusion myself -please help ! you say that black pepper helps the absorption of “ turmeric curcumin ” but then you say that if you eat the curcumin in the whole food form , ie as powdered turmeric root , you don ’ t need the black pepper to boost absorption because the natural fats do that for you . so am i to assume you only ever need to consume black pepper or fat with curcumin alone and if you use powdered turmeric you don ’ t need either of these additives ? thanks ! yes , i think your assumptions are correct based on my understanding of the video and some of the subsequent comments.if one adds up the average carb content of they indian populations with high rates of heart disease and diabetes , one sees very clearly why , in spite of eating tumeric and black pepper , they have these diseases . there is often , at one meal , chapaati , rice , potatoes and mangoes for desert. more carbs in one meal than needed for the day.could someone discuss what they know about this : http : / / bioperine.com / bioperine-vs-black-pepper.html bioperine ® vs. black pepperit is a general impression that the more you consume nutrients , the more will be made use of by the body . but biologically speaking , this is not always true . some nutrients taken at a higher dose will actually negate the benefit and will not be absorbed by the body . ideally speaking , the less , the best.similarly if one believes that since bioperine ® is sourced out of black pepper , all one need to do is increase the consumption of black pepper . again you have gone wrong , for the direct intake of black pepper will not help achieve enhanced nutrient absorption.according to clinical reports , having bioperine ® “ in the right place at the right time ” in the digestive tract with supplemented nutrient results in enhanced absorption . so bioperine ® when taken during illness will have the best nutrient absorption . besides if piperine were to remain captive in the form of raw black pepper , it will take time for its bioavailability enhancing property to be released . therefore , a purified extract of piperine is necessary to get the increased absorption.hi dr. greger.does this mean that it ’ s okay to sautee my garlic onion ginger and curry powder in a little bit of canola oil to release the flavor ? if no , what fat source should i add if any ? flax seeds ? great info once again dr g.certainly some lively discussions in this thread.here ’ s how i use turmeric : – add turmeric powder to my food when cooking it . i add it to the leek / onion & garlic base when they are first being lightly cooked in water before adding subsequent ingredients . – take turmeric powder off the spoon when drinking my morning or evening green smoothie or freshly made green juice . – add fresh turmeric root , crushed with a garlic press / crusher , to my bowl alongside other ingredients that are not going to be cooked / heated , such as avocado and lemon juice and fresh ginger root.i ’ m lucky that i live 15mins drive from an asian supermarket that sells fresh turmeric root for £ 1 per 100g ( i live in belfast , northern ireland , uk ) .does this mean you should avoid putting pepper on fish to avoid vitamin a issues ? excellent video as always . thanks for highlighting the article at the end on ghee . my roommates this year are indian . while i love having access to all those spices , they still do not understand why i refuse to eat their ghee-based curries , because “ everyone knows that it is good for you . ” ( 130 calories , all fat , most of it cholesterol and saturated ? not sure this is healthy . . . ) i think i ’ ll show them the article next time they try to tell me to eat ghee.sir , you are confusing me . if our liver is “ actively trying to get rid of curcumin ” , why , for health ’ s sake , to try to “ boost ” the effect of such a thing ? are we cleverer than our liver ? is something wrong with our liver so it is trying to get rid of toxins ? please , explain your philosophy on this . what is your viewpoint ? as always this is great , dr. greger . many thanks ! dr. rob ostfeld ( cardiac wellness center ) shared this study of turmeric and dha production with me , and that i thought you might find interesting. http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0925443914003779i am amazed that so many people making comments seem to think that canola oil is healthy and that no one has mentioned this thus far . approximately 90 percent of canola oil is gmo . need i explain that the rape seed crop is heavily sprayed with glyphosate all through the life cycle of the crop , including just before harvest to ripen the seed . i have also read that canola oil is heavily refined to get rid of the nasty smell and taste of rancidity , additionally it has an unhealthy ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 . the healthy choice is to avoid all canola oil.peoplehouse : here ’ s the perspective that i find helpful when it comes to talking about oils : * no * oil is healthy . all oils are highly refined , essentially pure-fat products . canola is not special in that respect . that said , if you are going to have some oil at all , then canola is a * relatively * good choice . you can get an organic product to avoid gmo and the sprays . and while the omega 3 to 6 ratio is bad , that ratio is better in canola oil than most other commonly used oils , including olive oil.so , for me , while i personally try to avoid all oils as much as possible , if i ’ m going to say spray some oil on my popcorn because i feel i just must do so , i ’ m not going to kid myself that i ’ m making a healthy choice , but i am probably going to choose the canola as a marginally better choice over the other options in my fridge.excellent info except for the last little blurb on butterfat and heart health . the latest studies show that the old connection between saturated fats and atherosclerosis as dreamed up by ancel keyes and his blind followers is totally false . all the biased studies trying vilify saturated fats failed if properly analyzed instead if being written up in circuitous language attempting to minimize the results , inevitably show the truth . fortunately after nearly 50 years of bias and misinformation in public health policy that has undoubtedly contribited to our current sad state of chronic metabolic desease in this country , the truth is coming out little by little.if taken in supplement form , what would be the effective dose for curcumin and piperine ? i ’ d prefer it in whole good form but one can only eat so much curry.dr. greger , are you advocating boosting curcumin with piperine ? it ’ s unclear in your reporting . thanks.i take a turmeric supplement every day . if i use it in cooking , i try to incorporate coconut oil as well to help with the absorption . i ’ ve noticed a marked improvement in the pain and swelling i get from my arthritis . i decided to take turmeric for my chronic inflammation when a relative told me about the anti-inflammatory benefits he was seeing from it . he suffers from a severe chronic inflammatory disease . after i began to use it , i noticed a small changes really quickly and a even more significant changes within about 3 weeks . i ’ ve been taking it faithfully ever since and feel so much better . in my opinion , turmeric is one of the best natural anti-inflammatories out there and i appreciate all the thoughtful information in the video . it will help me to make sure that i am getting the most anti-inflammatory benefits from the turmeric i cook with. alternative medicine , aspirin , asthma , butter , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , complementary medicine , curcumin , curry powder , fat , heart disease , heart health , herbs , india , liver health , malaria , medications , pepper , piperine , quinine , spices , tea , turmeric dietary strategies , including the use of black pepper ( piperine ) , can boost blood levels of curcumin from the spice turmeric by up to 2,000 % . why would we care about boosting curcumin levels ? i started talking about this golden spice pigment in which spices fight inflammation ? and spicing up dna protection and then moved on to treating actual clinical conditions in turmeric curcumin and rheumatoid arthritis and turmeric curcumin and osteoarthritis . next i ’ ll end this video series with some cautionary notes in who shouldn ’ t consume curcumin or turmeric.i ’ ve previously covered this topic of food synergy in videos such as apples and oranges : dietary diversity and garden variety anti-inflammation that emphasize the importance of eating a variety of plant foods to take advantage of some of these interactions.the black pepper mechanism reminds me of the grapefruit ( tell your doctor if you eat grapefruit ) and broccoli ( the best detox ) stories . a testament to the power of plants.the painkilling properties of aspirin mentioned in the video are actually found throughout the plant kingdom : aspirin levels in plant foods.in some circumstances , traditional medicine wisdom seems incredible ( tomato effect ) ; in others , dangerous ( get the lead out ) . but that ’ s what we now have science for !
PLAIN-2659	greens vs. glaucoma glaucoma is the second leading cause of legal blindness in white women , but the # 1 cause of blindness in african-american women . that 's one reason researchers chose a population of african-american women to study the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on glaucoma risk , but the other reason is because they were specifically interested in foods with the highest concentration of those eye-protecting phytonutrients like zeaxanthin--kale and collard greens — but you 'd be lucky if you could find 1 in 10 white people eating even a single serving a month , whereas that was a no-brainer for african americans.what 'd they find ? well as i 've stressed over the years , all fruits and vegetables are not the same . whether you hardly ever ate bananas or had one or more every day didn 't seem to matter much , but eating a couple oranges every week was associated with dramatically lower risk . not orange juice , though , you can drink orange juice every day and it didn 't seem to matter . a similar finding with peaches . fresh peaches seemed to work but canned peaches didn 't.similarly vegetables in general as a catch-all term didn 't seem to matter . for example , whether you ate a green salad twice a week , once a week or zero times a week didn 't seem to matter when it came to reducing glaucoma risk--you know how pitiful most people 's salads are . but here 's the kale and collard greens . check it out : just two or three servings a month was associated with half the risk of glaucoma compared to once a month or less . white people , take note , as you may need it even more . the lighter your eye color , the more greens you need to eat . blue eyes let 100 times more light through , so people with blue or gray eyes appear significantly more vulnerable to damage compared to brown or black , with green and hazel somewhere in the middle.it 's interesting - carrots appeared to be less protective in black women compared to white women . they suggest it could be a difference in food preparation methods . perhaps the african-american subjects tended to eat carrots raw , limiting the absorption of certain nutrients , while they chopped and prepared their collard greens with oil making the nutrients more bioavailable , ( because the absorption of carotenoid phytonutrients depends on the presence of fat , which is why i encourage people to eat nuts or seeds with the greens or a little tahini sauce ) .why not just take a zeaxanthin pill ? well we don 't know what exactly it is in these wonderful foods that ’ s working their wonders so it may be better to just recommend folks eat them , rather than take supplements . and , in fact , people that take calcium or iron supplements may be doubling , quadrupling or septupling their odds of glaucoma . better to get most of our nutrients from produce not pills thanks so much for continuing to look at glaucoma . i look forward to your upcoming video on treatment . i live in japan and have access to kale in all forms , but i especially find individual dry packets both convenient and palatable . i use a frother to whisk it into 6-8 oz fresh water at least once daily . both wheatgrass and kale are very popular health drinks here . i am being treated for glaucoma by nightly drops and hope to hear how my plant-based diet might help me further.two other items : i notice that i do not see that much about wheatgrass on your website and wonder if it is worth continuing to drink wheatgrass juice or to stick with kale . also , i use a mushroom extract ( “ soluable agaricus granul -contains beta glucan ” ) obtained locally in individual powder envelopes that i periodically mix into my miso soup . i have not noticed much on this topic and wondered if you would comment on the utility of agaricus blazie mushroom granules as it is sold ‘ for healthy living ’ and is promoted for those with cancer due to increased nk activity . it is sold in 3 gram packets ( 60 per box ) . another company has it at 1.5 gram packets ( 90 ) per box and i ’ ve used both and cannot tell the difference . after 6 years , i ’ m wondering if this has been a good investment now that i see you discussing nk activity recently on your website.dr greger had replied on the topic of wheat grass you can find it in the section ask the doctor : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / is-wheatgrass-superior-to-any-other-green / i ’ m a big fan of β-glucans , but believe you should be aware that there have been reports of a. blazei extracts causing liver failure ( 1 , 2 ) . it might be high levels of agaritine , or cadmium accumulation from growth medium , but the second report suggests that one can ingest enough β-glucans to stimulate autoimmune attack against healthy cells.modus omnibus in rebusthank you for your knowledge and citations on a. blazei and cancer patients with liver failure . i surmised potential autoimmune problems and , as i say , am a periodic user . i have good health and do not use alcohol but happen to have periodic liver panels ( use prescribed niacin ) . my liver function tests are always good . your citation led me to the local japanese name of this mushroom , which seems to be ‘ himematsutake . ’ i hope to find the whole food , which i prefer . as this mushroom was cultivated in brazil , i did not expect to find it here , although we have a vast array of varieties of mushrooms . as an american with limited kanji proficiency , a thoughtful daily life here entails considerable research . i appreciate your help and how your contributions on this web site are always well done.darryl , another great post , thanks ! do you have references for more mushroom nutrient levels like this ? i have a field of shaggy manes that grow in my yard in the summer , can ’ t find anything on them.coprinus comatus extracts aren ’ t as effective as button mushrooms in stimulating immune activity , but they are one of three mushrooms ( of 38 tested ) that kills breast cancer cells directly in vitro . they ’ re middle of the pack in ergothioneine levels , higher than buttons , and about a third as high as the various oyster mushrooms.thanks ! very interesting.how about barley grass powder ? i hear great things about this stuff but i don ’ t seem to be able to find any peer-reviewed research as to its merits alone , or compared to other “ greens ” . thanks for this topic . glaucoma is serious issue for lots , and many seem to be depending on things like barley grass supplements and wheat grass , and this might not be a good idea if the research does not support it when compared to the greens you have highlighted today.look at the link above in my answer to suzanne.over that past six months ( since discovering this site ) i have begun a regimen that is heavy in spinach and other whole foods . i have blue eyes and since my mother struggled with her eyes , ( macular degeneration ) , i am greatly concerned . should i be watch the amount of iron rich , green leafies i eat ? i already try to stay away from other sources iron.hi chris , nice going . to me , the message seems eat the whole food and avoid the super-concentrated , isolated extract / supplements . play the symphony , not the solo : ) the chemical mechanism via which carotenoids protect against uv damage is cool.uv light can excite the electrons of ordinary oxygen molecules into a higher energy and highly reactive state , called singlet molecular oxygen . our cells have few means of inactivating singlet oxygen before it does damage , but carotenoids like zeaxanthin can . see the long polyene chain of alterating single and double bonds in zeaxanthin : http : / / upload.wikimedia.org / wikipedia / commons / thumb / a / a3 / zeaxanthin.png / 640px-zeaxanthin.pngwhen singlet oxygen bumps into a carotenoid , it transfers its excited electronic energy to the polyene chain , where its passed back and forth along the narrowly spaced electron orbital energies of those double bonds , propelling the carotenoid a bit each time , until the excitement energy is dissippated as harmless heat . this process , called physical quenching , doesn ’ t consume the carotenoid as chemical quenching would . its ready to physically quench another singlet oxygen immediately.physical quenching by carotenoids is estimated to be 2000 times greater than their chemical quenching , but most antioxidant assays , including orac , don ’ t measure physical quenching of singlet oxygen . hence orac markedly underestimates the in vivo antioxidant potential of high carotenoid foods , like kale , tomatoes , spinach , mustard greens , swiss chard , collards and ( then ) carrots . lycopene from tomatoes is the most potent physical quencher , and eating tomato paste prevents sunburn , but lutein & xeazanthin ( high in kale , spinach , swiss chard , mustard greens , radicchio & collards ) are the only carotenoids found in the retina of the eye.that truly is fascinating . i thought i knew a decent bit about nutritional chemistry , and even i had never heard of the level to which this effect ( physical , non deconstructing , quenching ) can achieve ! there is so much wonderful science out that that if only every new paper could be put into action in terms of preparing some kind of monthly check list of the things we should eat and their amounts and preparation methods , that would be incredible . alas , places like this are about the closest we will ever get to such a collection . this site is a god bless , but consolidating everything into a universal daily , weekly , monthly diet regimen that would be easy for even the layman to understand would be wonderful . of course , everyone being different , ‘ universal ’ might be too word . maybe just guidelines . also , i wanted you to know that i appreciate the time you take in helping us poor souls out with the nuances of this field . i look forward to your tips each video almost as much as the video itself . i know often the science isn ’ t exact so its hard to steer people with 100 % certainty toward the best option , but even taking that into account , you are saving lives by walking us through it.awesome post darryl , thanks ! i was hoping the good doctor might be willing to write a column or produce a video on orthorexia nervosa , which appears to be a common phenomenon among users of nutritional websites . many vegans have the best intentions but more than a few are just feeding orthorectic eating habits.was a medical term coined for the population that eats crap or only for the people who care enough about their health to be proactive ? may i suggest : pararexia nervosaas with orthorexia , it won ’ t find its way into the dsm , but its fun to diagnose strangers from our armchairs.that will work . some of that stuff definitely isn ’ t food.dr , is it ok to have the kale and greens as green juices or does one need to have them cooked , to prevent glaucoma ? it doesn ’ t seem to matter . in this study , the bioavailability of lutein from whole leaf , minced , and liquified spinach was about the same . there is evidence that adding oil ( from avocados or avocado oil in this study ) increases lutein bioavailability from salad 4.3-to-6.7 fold . i suspect the situation would be similar with juices.dr. greger forgot to tell us why he used zeaxanthin in the description of this video . there are more than 100 beneficial phytochemicals in each of the plants that he mentions in this video.green cruciferous vegetables ( kale greens , collard greens , turnip greens , mustard greens , broccoli , watercress , brussel ’ s sprouts , and cabbage ) contain the carotenoids , lutein , neoxanthin , violaxanthin , beta-carotene , and only a moderate amount of zeaxanthin . crucifers also contain various glucosinolates and myrosinase , which will convert into various isothiocyanates when chewed.whole raw oranges , which did well in this study against glaucoma , are moderately rich in the carotenoids , beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene , but they contain very little zeaxanthin . the only citrus fruits that are high in zeaxanthin are red grapefruits ( but not white grapefruits ) .the fact that 100 % fruit juices did poorly compared to whole raw fruits indicates fiber , not carotenoids or polyphenols , delivered the glaucoma-preventing benefits.the fact that canned and dried peaches did poorly compared to whole raw peaches indicates that the good bacteria that thrive on raw plants may have delivered the glaucoma-preventing benefits and not the fiber , which feeds the good bacteria , or the carotenoids and polyphenols . in any event , peaches aren ’ t that high in zeaxanthin.the fact that iron supplements caused severe eye damage is not surprising because , like copper , manganese , and aluminum , iron is a pro-oxidant which , if consumed in excess , will damage every cell in our bodies and increase our risk of developing numerous killer diseases.the fact that calcium supplements caused severe eye damage is a bit of a surprise . i ’ ve heard that calcium supplements can cause calcified arteries , cardiovascular problems , and various cancers but i was not aware that swallowing calcium supplements can increase our risk of developing glaucoma.correction : red grapefruits are high in the carotenoid , lycopene , but contain zero zeaxanthin . therefore , all citrus fruits are low in both lutein and zeaxanthin.whole raw carrots performed moderately well against glaucoma in this study . carrots are extremely rich in beta-carotene but not that high in lutein or zeaxanthin.actually , the video says that cooked carrots are better for the eyes . min 2 : 21 “ perhaps the african american subjects tended to eat the carrots raw limiting the absorption of certain nutrients … ” too much calcium can be a risk factor for glaucoma just like too much iron , because calcium , like iron , is an oxidant . the studies show that 800 mg or more of supplemental calcium increase one ’ s risk just as 18 mg or more of supplemental iron do.i alternate my breakfasts between steel-cut oats ( with walnuts , blackberries and unsweetened soy milk ) and quinoa ( with blueberries , almonds , ground flax seed and unsweetened soy milk ) . then , time permitting , i make a green smoothie consisting of kale and / or collard greens . i got someone at work drinking the kale concoction , and she loves the clean feeling it gives you.this is a little bit off-topic , but here is a very well put together website on some amazing vegan athletes . be sure to vote for the vegan athlete of 2013 while you ’ re there : http : / / www.greatveganathletes.com / i ’ m confused … the initial premise was that black women suffer * more * from glaucoma than white women . then it proceeds with how black women eat tons more greens and have dark-pigment eyes , while white women eat no such greens and have pale eyes . so … . huh ? fooblahgrl : it ’ s a valid question . i haven ’ t looked at the studies , so i can ’ t answer with any authority . but here ’ s my guess : as a population , black people probably eat more kale and collards , but there would still be a lot of variability within the population . so , you could take that population and compare those who eat more to those who eat less . where as , it is presumably hard to find a “ eat more ” group of significant size of the white women . what do you think ? i was confused too about that and rewatched the video . the scientists wanted to see if kale and collards were protective but they couldn ’ t find enough white people eating them so they studied a group of african americans . amongst that group there were people who ate them and people who didn ’ t and the ones who ate them had far less incidence of glaucoma.doctor greger , there ’ s an article floating around on facebook called “ the dark side of kale ( and how to eat around it ) ” that i found troubling. as a huge fan of kale ( i put lots of kale in my breakfast smoothie each day ) , i am having trouble believing that this is a credible article.can you please address this article ? the article that i am referring to is here : http : / / commonhealth.wbur.org / 2014 / 01 / the-dark-side-of-kale-and-how-to-eat-around-itplease see this video regarding overdosing on kale. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / overdosing-on-greens / the issues presented in the article are present when one consumes massive amounts that normally wouldn ’ t be consumed through a normal diet.hi doctor , i suffer from a bad thyroid that eventually stabilized with levothyroxine treatment ( 129mcg / daily ) . i ’ ve heard so much about the health benefits of greens such as kale that i ’ ve included it in my juicing diet i ’ ve started recently . however , i ’ ve been hearing that cruciferous vegetable contain goitrogens which can cause more harm with those suffering from thyroid disorders . could you consider a video or article regarding this issue and any possible alternatives for those who want to add greens to their diet with this problem ? african-american , antioxidants , bananas , blindness , calcium , carrots , collard greens , cooking methods , eye disease , eye health , fat , fruit , fruit juice , glaucoma , greens , iron , juice , kale , nuts , oils , orange juice , oranges , peaches , phytonutrients , seeds , supplements , tahini , vegetables , vision , women 's health , zeaxanthin kale and collard greens contain vision-protecting plant nutrients such as zeaxanthin that may significantly lower the risk of glaucoma , a leading cause of blindness . i demonstrated the not-all-fruits-and-veggies-are-the-same motif recently in my video how to reach the antioxidant rda.i explored the fat-enhanced absorption of carotenoid phytonutrients in forgo fat-free dressings ? don ’ t eggs also have zeaxanthin ? find out how much in egg industry blind spot.i wish there were more studies on under-represented minorities . i ’ ve covered a few , such as preventing breast cancer by any greens necessary , but am constantly on the lookout for more.the only other video i ’ ve done on glaucoma is prevent glaucoma and see 27 miles farther , though i have a video coming up soon on treating the disease , dietary treatment of glaucoma . next , however , is macular degeneration : dietary prevention of age-related macular degeneration .
PLAIN-2669	autopsy of chicken nuggets in a scathing expose of the usda ’ s new meat inspection program , the washington post quoted a representative from the inspector ’ s union , who said pig processing lines may be moving too quickly to catch tainted meat . “ tremendous amounts of fecal matter remain on the carcasses , ” he said . “ not small bits , but chunks . ” what about the other white meat ? the physician ’ s committee for responsible medicine created this infographic to highlight what they consider to be the five worst contaminants in chicken products . in their investigation of retail chicken products in 10 u.s. cities they found fecal contamination in about half the chicken they bought at the store . but with all the focus on what ’ s in chicken products , we may have lost sight on what may be missing , like actual chicken.researchers recently published an “ autopsy ” of chicken nuggets in the american journal of medicine . the purpose was to determine the contents of chicken nuggets from two national food chains . because chicken nuggets are a favorite of children , and the obesity epidemic now extends to them as well , they thought knowing a bit more about the content of the contemporary chicken nugget could be important . the nugget from the first restaurant was composed of approximately 50 % skeletal muscle , with the remainder composed primarily of fat , with some blood vessels and nerve present , along with generous quantities of skin or gut lining and associated supportive tissue . the nugget from the second restaurant was composed of approximately 40 % skeletal muscle with lots of other tissues including bone . “ i was floored , ” said the lead investigator , ” i had read what other reports have said is in them and i didn ’ t believe it . i was astonished actually seeing it under the microscope . ” they conclude that actual chicken meat was not the predominant component of either nugget — it was mostly other tissues , concluding the term chicken nugget is really a misnomer . clearly no nutritional expert in their right mind would advocate eating commercially bought “ chicken nuggets ” . but while a diet rich in plant foods can be quite healthy , taken to excess , it can lead to certain harms . for example , a total absence of animal foods deprives one of vitamin b12 , riboflavin , essential fatty acids like dha , iodine , vitamin d , etc ; it also extremely low on other important micronutrients like bioavailable iron , calcium , riboflavin , tryptophan , choline , carnitine and taurine . conversely , many members of the population ( at least a third ) have , for good reason , evolved a “ supertaster ” gene preference to avoid bitter green leafy vegetables for the very reason that many plants and their products ( seeds , etc ) contain natural pesticides and other relatively toxic compounds , including phytates , oxalate , lectins , and goitrogens ; not to mention large quantities of omega-6 fatty acids in many seeds and nuts . eaten to excess , these moieties could cause severe problems including mineral deficiency , hypothyroidism , and uncontrolled inflammation.it is probably the case that the best of both worlds combines a diet rich in plants with a diet containing adequate amounts of oily species of fish , preferably those tested to be low in contaminants such as mercury , pcbs and furans like dioxin . this explains why pesco-vegetarians had the most optimal pattern of disease-free outcomes in the recent adventist health study ii , published this past spring in jama internal medicine . finally , any diet that requires taking a fistful of supplements is probably not a very healthy or nutritionally intact diet.pretty much everything you said is incorrect . greger already talked about all of this in his other videos , backed by hundreds of scientific study.dha should be supplemented in a vegetarian diet . that part is accurate but otherwise it ’ s completely off course . riboflavin and b12 not in any vegetarian diet ? try looking into that again.humans do not need dietary dha , it is not an essential fatty acid . humans only requires ala , found in plants . this is the position of the food and nutrition board of the national academies of science. http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 10490 & page = 423sorry , this is still in debate as the conversion rate is very different , depending on age , sex , fat intake , fat types and genetic.a diet including 2-3 portions of fatty fish per week , which corresponds to the intake of 1.25 g epa ( 20 : 5n-3 ) + dha ( 22 : 6n-3 ) per day has been officially recommended on the basis of epidemiological findings showing a beneficial role of these n-3 long-chain pufa in the prevention of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases . the parent fatty acid ala ( 18 : 3n-3 ) , found in vegetable oils such as flaxseed or rapeseed oil , is used by the human organism partly as a source of energy , partly as a precursor of the metabolites , but the degree of conversion appears to be unreliable and restricted . more specifically , most studies in humans have shown that whereas a certain , though restricted , conversion of high doses of ala to epa occurs , conversion to dha is severely restricted.the use of ala labelled with radioisotopes suggested that with a background diet high in saturated fat conversion to long-chain metabolites is ∼ 6 % for epa and 3.8 % for dha.with a diet rich in n-6 pufa , conversion is reduced by 40 to 50 % . it is thus reasonable to observe an n-6 / n-3 pufa ratio not exceeding 4-6 . restricted conversion to dha may be critical since evidence has been increasing that this long-chain metabolite has an autonomous function , e. g. in the brain , retina and spermatozoa where it is the most prominent fatty acid . in neonates deficiency is associated with visual impairment. abnormalities in the electroretinogram and delayed cognitive development . in adults the potential role of dha in neurological function still needs to be investigated in depth . regarding cardiovascular risk factors dha has been shown to reduce triglyceride concentrations . these findings indicate that future attention will have to focus on the adequate provision of dha which can reliably be achieved only with the supply of the preformed long-chain metabolite.http : / / cat.inist.fr / ? amodele = affichen & cpsidt = 2315106human beings are poor dha synthesizers , possibly because of their lc ( n-3 ) p-abundant ancient diet . dietary changes in the past century have lowered the ( n-3 ) status to a current state of subclinical deficiency that is epidemiologically related to cvd , inflammatory disorders , mental and psychiatric diseases and suboptimal neurodevelopment . the strongest evidence comes from randomized controlled trials with lc ( n-3 ) p , showing reduced mortality from cvd , improved neonatal neurodevelopment , and lower blood pressure in later life . with these studies as evidence , we conclude that dha is likely to be essential.http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 134 / 1 / 183.longmy proposal : go for an omega 3 blood panel of your red blood cell ’ s membranes . if your index is > 8 % you have it well done , if it more or less < 6 % you are in the same range as joe sixpack on his sad … i would not messa round with this as a healthy brain should consist 30-40 % of dha ! this is my understanding too . that ’ s why i continue to consume 250 mg of dha as a vegetarian supplement . in some brain tissues ( e.g. gray matter ) , dha concentration exceeds 50 % . there is significant evidence that our early hominid ancestors in the rift valley system had broad access to fish species rich in dha , and that this may have promoted frontal cortex development onto a path allowing for the development of language and other “ higher order ” functions . see : broadhurst cl , cunnane sc & crawford ma ( 1998 ) rift valley lake fish and shellfish provided brain-specific nutrition for early homo . british journal of nutrition 79 , 3 – 21.there are numerous studies of vegetarians and vegans who do not consume fish and have very low dha levels . one except is the epic study , but this has been heavily criticized ( see jack norris ’ s commentary on this study on veganhealth.org at http : / / veganhealth.org / articles / omega3 # n3intake ) . so if we can ’ t make dha in sufficient quantities from ala , and what production we can afford is subject to high background rates of linoleic acid intake present in most plant-based diets , it only makes sense to supplement with dha . the only downside is cost . “ interest in the cardiovascular protective effects of n – 3 ( omega-3 ) fatty acids has continued to evolve during the past 35 y since the original research describing the low cardiovascular event rate in greenland inuit was published by dyerberg et al . numerous in vitro experiments have shown that n – 3 fatty acids may confer this benefit by several mechanisms : they are antiinflammatory , antithrombotic , and antiarrhythmic . the n – 3 fatty acids that have received the most attention are those that are derived from a fish source ; namely the longer-chain n – 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ; 20 : 5n – 3 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ; 22 : 6n – 3 ) . more limited data are available on the cardiovascular effects of n – 3 fatty acids derived from plants such as a-linolenic acid ( ala ; 18 : 3n – 3 ) . observational data suggest that diets rich in epa , dha , or ala do reduce cardiovascular events , including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death ; however , randomized controlled trial data are somewhat less clear . several recent meta-analyses have suggested that dietary supplementation with epa and dha does not provide additive cardiovascular protection beyond standard care , but the heterogeneity of included studies may reduce the validity of their conclusions . no data exist on the potential therapeutic benefit of epa , dha , or ala supplementation on those individuals who already consume a vegetarian diet . overall , there is insufficient evidence to recommend n – 3 fatty acid supplementation for the purposes of cardiovascular protection ; however , ongoing studies such as the alpha omega trial may provide further information.combined with the lack of convincing clinical data in favor of n – 3 fatty acid supplementation for cardiovascular endpoints and the lack of data in those that consume a vegetarian diet , it is difficult to make the recommendation that vegetarians should consume fish to optimize their cardiovascular mortality . ” http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 89 / 5 / 1597s.long “ comparison of the pllc n23 pufas : dala ratio between dietary-habit groups showed that it was 209 % higher in vegan men and 184 % higher in vegan women than in fish-eaters , was 14 % higher in vegetarian men and 6 % higher in vegetarian women than in fish-eaters , and was 17 % and 18 % higher in male and female meat-eaters , respectively , than in fish-eaters this suggests that the statistically estimated conversion may be higher in non-fish-eaters than in fish-eaters . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20861171in addition , another study showed that despite this “ theoretical ” low conversion rate , there is no evidence of any harm so , the problem may not be in the conversion rate , but in the assumption that it is low . “ there is no evidence of adverse effects on health or cognitive function with lower dha intake in vegetarians ” “ in the absence of convincing evidence for the deleterious effects resulting from the lack of dha from the diet of vegetarians , it must be concluded that needs for omega-3 fatty acids can be met by dietary ala . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19500961thank you toxins for a great post ! jack norris rd had some interesting comments about the epic norfolk dha findings ( see http : / / veganhealth.org / articles / omega3 # n3intake ) : “ vegans and vegetarians have been shown in many studies to have lower levels of long chain omega-3 fatty acids ( epa and dha ) than meat eaters . table 4 shows the results of some of these studies . the general trend is that lacto-ovo vegetarians and vegans have lower levels of epa and dha in their blood . one exception is the 5 vegan women in the 2010 uk study who had , on average , higher dha levels than even the fish-eaters . this is probably an anomaly for a few reasons . first , “ vegan ” was simply defined as someone who did not list eating animal products in their 7-day diet diaries . these vegans might have only been vegan for one week . second , there were only 5 vegan women in the study making the finding unlikely to be statistically significant . third , the standard deviation for the dha levels of the vegan women was very high at 211 µmol / l . that means that one or two of the vegan women had very high levels of dha but some had very low levels . ” also , a follow-up letter-to-the-editor strongly criticized their methodology and findings : http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 93 / 5 / 1154.1.longso it is important to get the full context on these cited papers.dr. g recommends an algae oil supplement , so i have started taking 250 mg dha , also comes with a tiny bit of omega 6.a couple of years ago dr. g also recommended taking 4000 iu / day of vitamin d and then reduced this recommendation by a factor of two the following year . no doubt the dude is a genius , but that doesn ’ t make him infallible . he may or may not be right about the dha / epa issue , but the issue seems unsettled as you can tell from this discussion . here ’ s a summary of the 2009 position of the american dieticians : “ vegetarians should include good sources of ala in their diet , such as flaxseed , walnuts , canola oil , and soy . those with increased requirements of n-3 fatty acids , such as pregnant and lactating women , may benefit from dha-rich microalgae ” the conversion rate is adequate for all age groups . there are literally millions of vegetarian people around the world ( jains , buddhists , taoists , seventh day advenists ) who produce and maintain normal brains throughout life and have low risk of vascular disease without consuming preformed epa or dha in the amounts that you suggest , and “ there is no evidence to suggest that the capacity for dha synthesis in vegetarians is limited . ” http : / / www.bryceacarlson.com / files / h2m7 / carlson % 20and % 20kingston % 202007a.pdfall studies showing limited conversion are done on men , who have very low dha needs , probably because they don ’ t bear costs of child-bearing and ~ 97 % of neural

information . i found it to be very helpful and well worded . thanks.very educational post ! your last link doesn ’ t work . i am interested in reading this study please.yes , but greger has an answer for literally everything . he and his sponsors have an ideology and science can be cherry picked . i think there is a lot of good information here and it seems likely that minimizing animal foods in the diet is the best for health , but i question the wisdom of going 100 % vegan for health reasons.also , is it really a problem that chicken nuggets are 50 % muscle but also contain other chicken parts . aren ’ t those parts ultimately either protein or fat ? they ’ ll either be digested and used or passed . what ’ s the big deal ? “ also , is it really a problem that chicken nuggets are 50 % muscle but also contain other chicken parts . ” it is if , as in this case , the “ nuggets ” contain things like intestinal lining ( which they shouldn ’ t ) . have you heard of campylobacter , e. coli , salmonella , listeria and shigella ? these are all present in chicken fecal material . i , for one , would prefer not to eat chicken feces or intestines.who are dr. greger ’ s sponsors ? i can ’ t find any advertisers on his website.steve : the only “ sponsors ” are those everyday people who respect the quality of the work on this site . it ’ s people who understand that dr. greger carefully reviews the “ body of evidence ” ( all studies ) , not just one or two studies , and then keeps us informed by sharing the relevant individual ones . in other words : people like you and me who donate our own money to keep this site going for the benefit of all . that ’ s it as far as i know – after the initial grant money got used.i think respondents here would do well to explain their points rather than just say “ dr gregor says … ” “ many members of the population ( at least a third ) have , for good reason , evolved a “ supertaster ” gene . . . ” ha , ha . that ’ s rich . i have evolved an automatic bs meter and the needle is going off the chart with your post.i would love to meet the person who eats way too many bitter leafy greens … and shake their hand.chessie : hee , hee . me too ! i need to hang out with these super people . good habits might rub off on me.this comment is full of inaccuracies , exaggerations and outright falsehoods . to start with , the various claims about a “ total absence ” of certain nutrients in a vegan ( a.k.a. “ plant based ” ) diet are just plain false.vitamin b12 ? wrong . b12 is produced by bacteria , and the exact same bacteria that produce b12 in the gut of an animal can produce the exact same b12 in a culture dish . if you think that ’ s unnatural , then don ’ t ever eat any food produced by fermentation , including yogurt and bread.riboflavin ( b2 ) ? wrong . b2 is plentiful in legumes , peas , nuts and seeds as well as green vegetables including broccoli and collards.iodine ? wrong . kelp is an excellent source of iodine.essential fatty acids ? wrong . hemp oil and flax oil are rich in essential fatty acids . ( i notice that you condemn a vegan diet for lacking essential fatty acids , and then contradict yourself by condemning seeds and nuts for containing “ large quantities ” of omega-6 fatty acids , which suggests to me that you are really ignorant about this issue , and worse , didn ’ t even read your own post ) .vitamin d ? wrong . the main and best way to obtain vitamin d is through exposure to sunlight , which enables our own bodies to produce vitamin d. most of the vitamin d consumed from animal foods comes from “ fortified ” foods which have vitamin d added ( e.g. milk ) , and similarly fortified vegetarian alternatives ( soy milk , rice milk ) are just as good.the rest of your babble about plant foods being “ extremely low on important micronutrients ” is just more equally ignorant and blatantly false rubbish , as are your ridiculous suggestions that green leafy vegetables should be avoided because they contain “ toxic compounds ” .look , if it ’ s your job or something to spread anti-vegetarian propaganda , you need to up your game , because this is really , really bogus , lame , laughable stuff , as anyone who takes 10 seconds to consult some basic nutritional references will immediately realize.you ’ re right , the post was full of information , but its one correct point was on b12 . unless you take a supplement of b12 , you won ’ t get any on an all-plant diet . you won ’ t have any problem getting b12 on an animal food diet , though of course you ’ ll get the rest of the load of detrimental substances too.b12 deficiency has been detected in meat eaters , too.comment appreciated . the body consists only of cells and the cells recognize their nutritional needs . enzymes are required to enable nutrients to access the cells and if there is a lack of enzymes the nutrients will be wasted . enzymes are manufactured by the body and you can read more about that in books such as that written by lita , lee and goldberg . ( “ the enzyme cure – how plant enzymes can help you relieve 36 health problems ” ) . some people have an enzyme shortage whilst in any case our bodies manufacture less the older we get . the best source of enzymes would be fruit and live green veggies . the enzymes start dying off at temperatures exceeding 118 degrees f. so eating dead cooked food might still have some surviving nutrients but they still have to be piggy-backed on enzymes to get to the cells . so , the more dead food the bigger strain on the body ’ s metabolism to get its engine working optimally.my spouse is 85 and i am a youngster of only 77 . we have been following a vegan diet for the last 14 years and use some supplements which are considered to be live food . we are not evangelical about it but in general would stay away from animal proteien . this works for us and the only regret which we have is that we did not make an earlierstart on this journey . our choice was health driven.obviously you havent done a whole lot of research on an all plant b ased diet.you do not need meat and dairy or “ oily ” fish to get all the nutrients you are talking about.i have been on the forks over knives / engine2 diet for a few months now and my blood levels have improved drastically in a short period of time , and i take no supplements.if you know what to eat , you can get it all and prevent cancer , diabetes , heart disease and animal abuse all in one shot with a plant strong diet.its all in there.isn ’ t it illegal to name a product by anything other than the main ingredient ? it ’ s just a product name , they can call it whatever they want , think about it , there ’ s no milk in soy milk or almond milk , there ’ s no apple nor pine in pineapple , there ’ s no egg in eggplant , there ’ s no ham in hamburger and the list just goes on.ha. i think you should keep the list going on . it ’ s kinda funny.there ’ s no law on this , you can name thing as you like . think about it , there ’ s no milk in either soy milk or almond milk , there is no apple nor pine in pineapple , there is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger and the list just goes on.that ’ s not true . there are laws concerning some product names . it ’ s not legal to call cheese-like substances cheese for example . look at a pack of velveeta or kraft singles ( “ american cheese ” ) and you will not see “ cheese ” on the package . you could see “ cheese food ” or “ american pasteurized cheese product ” but they can ’ t just call it a cheese . certain kinds of alcohol are regulated closely in various countries.yup … .and what about the added chemicals – like simethicone , a type of silicone oil . – also an antiflatulent drug.what are some natural sources of good bacteria ? is kombucha good for you ? derrek : dr. greger has a video about kombucha . i highly recommend watching that video before consuming any.i have an idea for you : i have been making a home-made probiotic called “ rejuvalac ” . i make mine from quinoa , which goes very fast . i use it as an ingredient in vegan nut cheese , but i know that some people drink it . it doesn ’ t taste awesome by itself , but it doesn ’ t taste bad either . and you could put it in juice or something . perhaps you might want to research rejuvalac ? fyi : the instructions for making it looked intimidating to me at first , but after i did it the first time , i decided it is super-easy . you just have to be willing to wait a couple days for the finished product . if you are interested , i am willing to write out how i make it.the other thing you might want to research is “ water kefir ” .i don ’ t know how much either of these products is likely to have the type of bacteria that you are looking for , but it seems worth investigating to me . it would be something that is fresh and vegan . and it might help ? ? ? hope that helps ! could you provide the recipe for it ? also , how do you ferment veggies and fruit without adding a bunch of junk llke sugar and etc . ? rejuvalac : part 1 – intro textderrek : i ’ m sorry , but i have no idea about fermenting fruits and veggies.i also thought i would mention my own personal situation : when i went to a whole plant food diet , i didn ’ t any change in frequency of gas . but i did notice that the odor decreased significantly . others i have read about noticed similar change . so , while i have no idea what might actually be wrong with you , i do agree that something isn ’ t right . i hope you are able to figure it out . i have no idea if rejuvalac would fix your problem , but it seems worth trying . — — - the following directions for rejuvalac are modified from the book artisan vegan cheese by miyoko schinner . the modifications are what works for me , including knowledge i had picked up from reading a couple books on sprouting . i found that if i use the quinoa for the grain , both the sprouting phase and the culturing phase take the smallest amount of time given the expected time ranges listed below . though time also depends on temperature . some day i want to try different grains to see if they taste different.the following makes about 6-8 cups of rejuvalac . i don ’ t know how much you should drink a day to meet your needs . but suppose that you make 7 cups and you drink a cup a day ? ( say 1 / 2 cup two times a day ? ? ? ) then the following recipe would cost you the price of a cup of quinoa or other whole grain each week . i would think that would cost less than buying the pills . fyi : i use organic quinoa that i store in my freezer with the idea of keeping it super-fresh and free of as much bad bacteria as i can . ( that ’ s just a theory on my part . ) best of luck to you ! ! ! rejuvalac : part 2 – the instructionsingredients — — — — — > 1 cup whole grains ( quinoa , brown rice , kamut , millet , oat , rye wheat or a combo ) > 6-8 cups filtered waterequipment — — — — — if you can find one of the giant sprouting jars ( half gallon size – whole foods sells one ) , then you can use that single container for all steps . otherwise : > one quart jar with lid / cover for soaking and sprouting phases listed below – a one quart canning jar with steel screen or cheese cloth bound with a rubber band works well . here is a place to get the screen : http : / / www.amazon.com / down-to-earth-sprouting-screen / dp / b000n05gjw / ref = pd _ sbs _ gro _ 2 > glass container for culturing – big enough to hold 6-8 cups water ( or can use 2 jars of a size of a quart or do what i did and get a single big glass container with a lid ) process — — — — — > soaking phase : put grains in a sprouting jar and cover with regular water to a couple inches above the grain . let soak 8 to 12 hours . drain off water .

( some people prop the jar on it ’ s side or at an angle downward . be sure there is plenty of air circulation , though through the lid / cover . in other words , don ’ t store completely upside down . i shake the jar until the quinoa is spread out on the side of the jar as it rests on it ’ s side . ) from this point on , you want grains constantly damp , but not sitting in any standing water . rinse and drain 2-4 times per day until you see tails on the grains .

PLAIN-2679	phosphate additives in meat purge and cola in my video , treating kidney failure through diet , i profiled research suggesting the use of a vegan diet for patients with kidney failure , because control of dietary phosphorus intake is the lynchpin in the successful control of a leading cause of disease and death in kidney failure patients , too much phosphorous in the blood.but now we 're beginning to realize that absorbing too much phosphorus isn 't good for anyone . having high levels in our blood has been found to be an independent predictor of heart attacks and mortality in the general population , increasing the risk of not only kidney failure , but heart failure , heart attacks , coronary death and overall death . higher phosphate levels associated with a significantly shorter lifespan . dietary intake of phosphate is an important matter not just for persons with kidney disease , but also for everybody . it 's thought to cause damage to blood vessels and accelerate the aging process , and even potentially hurt our bones , by contributing to osteoporosis by disrupting hormonal regulation . the estimated average requirement of phosphorus is less than 600 a day , but the estimated average intake is nearly twice that in the united states . how do we stay away from the stuff ? if you look at nutrient tables , it looks like many plant foods have as much phosphorous as many animal foods , so why are plant-based diets so effective in treating kidney failure patients ? because most of the phosphorus in plant foods is found in the form of phytic acid , which we can 't digest , so the bioavailability of plant phosphates is usually less than 50 % . see only a third to a half of plant phosphorus may be absorbable , whereas most animal products are up around 75 % .so when you adjust for how much actually gets into our system , you see plant foods are better . it 's like the absorption of heme and non-heme iron , your body can protect itself from absorbing too much plant-based iron , but can 't stop excess blood-based , or heme iron from animals slipping through the intestinal wall.the worst kind of phosphorus , that ’ s absorbed nearly 100 % , are phosphate additives added , for example , to cola drinks . why would they do that ? cola drinks would otherwise be black . without the added phosphate , there would be so many glycotoxins produced that the beverage would turn pitch black . thus , cola drinks owe their brown color to phosphate.phosphate additives play an especially important role in the meat industry , where they are used as preservatives , for the same reason , to enhance a meat product ’ s color . just like the dairy industry adds aluminum to cheese , meat and poultry is " enhanced " by injecting it with phosphates . if you look at meat industry trade journals and can get past all the macabre ads for head dropping robots for the kill floor and foot chopper-offers , you 'll see all these ads for injection machines . why ? because of increased profitability . enhanced meats have better color and less purge.purge is a term used to describe the liquid that seeps from flesh as it ages . many consumers find this unattractive , so the industry views it as a win-win . when you inject chicken with phosphates the consumer benefits through the perception of enhanced quality , and the processor benefits from increased yield because they just pumped it up with water and they sell it by the pound . the problem is that it can boost phosphorus levels in meat nearly 70 % , a real and insidious danger for kidney patients , but now we know it 's a danger for all.to see any graphs , charts , graphics , images , and quotes to which dr. greger may be referring , watch the above video . this is just an approximation of the audio contributed by ariel levitsky . crazy story once again . i ’ m happy to be vegan sometimes . i got some questions in mind : do we have dietary need for phosphate ? the bones aren ’ t made of calcium and phosphate bonded together ? and it doesn ’ t get inside the atp molecule too ? are we at risk of high phosphate intake if we use creatine supplement with a whole plant based diet ? sometimes i ’ m confused , phosphate , phosphorous , phosphoric acide .. it looks like iron , needed but not too much . it ’ s seems that once again , plants offer the best choice.adrien , intestinal phosphate loading actually reduces calcium absorption by complexing with calcium in the gut and inactivating it so that the calcium cannot get absorbed . thus despite the fact that our skeletal predominant article is calcium hydroxyapatite ( which has phosphate in it ) , we do ourselves a disservice by taking in too much phosphate in the diet . this is one of the reasons that colas literally leach our skeleton of calcium ( another is that they are highly acidic ) .thanks for the hint on phosphate and calcium absorption / balance . but , on the subject of leaching calcium from our bones ( due to an acidic environnement ) that theory had been revised . and it seems that acidity damage more our muscles than our bones . that being said , i don ’ t drink soda and has been since a while and i think my diet is slightly alkali . thanks to my favorite doctor , i discovered the amazing “ flower power ” hibiscus tea ; ) more hints on my other questions , anybody ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-diets-animal-protein-and-calcium-loss / adrien , i did not realize that the theory on how soda pop damages bones by being acidic has been revised . certainly soda will rot your teeth enamel , in part due to hyperacidity.also , with respect to your other questions ( adp + p = atp ) , i would make a conjecture that as long as you are not hypophosphatemic , bioenergetics will not be compromised . it is very difficult to become hypophosphatemic through diet alone . certain tumors of the gastrointestinal tract can leach large amounts of phosphate which can cause hypophosphatemia and all the problems therein ( e.g. muscle breakdown ) .i hope someone else can answer your question about creatine , as i really don ’ t know . i am not aware of any evidence linking creatine supplements with hyperphosphatemia . @ disqus _ 7ebxqj0uan : disqus i ’ m happy to be vegan all the damn time : - ) damn right ! ! ! we do have a dietary need for phosphorus . our bones contain phosphorous . but what we need and what we are getting from industrial and agrochemical companies are two different stories.that ’ s an amazing video . yes phosphate is a really hot topic right now in kidney circles . interestingly , calcimetics which bind up and inactivate phosphate do not appear to lower mortality in kidney disease patients ( e.g. beacon and anchor trials ) . this has led some to believe that phosphate is an epiphenomenon ( not causally related to death and cardiovascular events in kidney disease patients ) ; however , these agents may have significant off-target toxicity ( like the hdl-raising drugs ) that obviate any phosphate-lowering benefit.the injection industry is also fascinating . i did not realize that chickens are dunked in a bath of basically pus-water to boost up their weight ; in fact , up to 30 % of the weight of the chicken that people are buying in the grocery store consists of this added pus-filled water . why pus ? because of the factory farm system being so hard on animals ; read it in “ eating animals ” by jonathan safran-foer . fascinating ! who wants to eat injected anything ? i agree with adrien that videos like this only confirm my decision to go vegan . i thank you , dr greger , for continuing to produce them.and hence the responsible governments in us , canada and europe will ban the use of phosphate additives to protect the consumer … … … .. won ’ t they ? not unless there is money to be made out of it … indeed , have you notice that there is war against cancer , but not against homelessness ? no money can be made out of poor people , but a lot of diseased and scared people. http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = lncloeqc9rwand the war on cancer has been going on for 40 years with limited results ( i mean we are not winning ) , probably because of wrong approach – attack ( toxic treatment ) instead of defence ( prevention ) . reason : a lot of money in treatment , no money in prevention.re : the war on cancer — i thought this was a really good article . definitely changed my perspective . even when the mainstream powers that be talk “ prevention ” what they ’ re typically describing is actually treatment / tests , or fear-mongering , without any real guidance on real preventative measures ( i.e. vegetables ) . “ our feel-good war on breast cancer ” http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2013 / 04 / 28 / magazine / our-feel-good-war-on-breast-cancer.html ? _ r = 0i ’ d like to note i have never had breast cancer or even had any close loved ones have it , and i ’ m not personally trying to discourage the self-tests or mammograms ; i just think this article raises some good questions for discussion.actually mammography is pretty controversial . even here in canada we over-screen with it . the group that sets the guidelines for clinical practice has just told doctors to substantially back off and start at a later age . there is not a lot of high quality evidence that mammography saves lives or prevents advanced cancer . the head of the cochrane nordic centre in denmark is adamantly against breast cancer as he feels that the balance of benefits and harms is highly weighted towards harms ( false positives , unnecessary biopsies , unnecessary anxiety , radiation-associated tumors ) . i am not in the field so i do not keep “ abreast ” of the recommendations as closely as i would need to if i was in oncology or family medicine , but it seems many cancer screening practices have lately been turned against – e.g. psa testing and mammography , just to name two . of course the oncologists , urologists and surgeons are up in arms against these recommendations as this represents a direct threat to their bottom line . a woman is much more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than breast cancer , but most worry far more about breast ca than they do their vascular health , which can be definitely influenced through diet.yes , screening is not prevention , but early detection , and that can be problematic as dan points out . the 5 year survival is longer with early detection , not necessarily because of treatment , but because you were diagnosed at an earlier stage of disease.i recommend all women who are considering getting a mammogram read the cochrane leaflet on screening mammography and discuss with their physicians … http : / / www.cochrane.dk / screening / mammography-leaflet.pdf i believe all physicians / nurse practitioners / physician assistants who are involved with breast cancer screening read peter gotzsche ’ s book . see dr. mcdougall ’ s may 2012 for more information on this book which goes through all the studies.b00mer : that ny times article is so good and comes at such a good time for me given a family conversation i am having . thank you for posting it here.you ’ re welcome thea , i ’ m glad you found it helpful . : ) i can remember back to learning about self breast exams in middle school – being taught to “ fear our breasts ” as the article describes as pre-teens . but of course no one ever taught us about broccoli , tea , mushrooms , soy , etc , any of the real proactive and empowering preventative measures we could take . it ’ s a shame about how much money gets funneled into perpetual fund-raising rather than research by the big advocacy groups , and yet at the same time there is * so much * that women can do to help themselves with the research and knowledge that we have so far . if only that knowledge was being presented in the mainstream media rather than the message that we ’ re all helpless victims.i resonate with everything you just wrote ! ! i feel a lot more empowered now about my own health . all aspects of it , including avoiding breast cancer . too bad this info isn ’ t more widely shared . ah well , one person at a time … industry – agribusiness and junk food manufacturers like coca cola – would stop any effort to ban the use of phosphate additives to protect the consumer , as they will not want to lose market share ( e.g. by turning their product ‘ black ’ or stopping purge ) . on the other hand , no one is speaking up to government to protect our ‘ nutritional health rights ’ . it is classic ‘ david vs goliath ’ and we are all david ( those of us who are even in the ‘ know ’ ) . the only solution that i can see is to stop consuming phosphate-rich sources like meatstuffs and cola , as well as junk food with processed , unpronounceable ingredients.yes , the best is to eat food with only one ingredient – broccoli contains broccoli ! as long as broccoli is grown by the original organic method , and preferably by individuals rather than mass producing farmers.well , yes.i agree . but , how are we going to avoid gmo ’ s which resist more roundup , when our government seems to now be owned by monsanto and the obama administration is weakening regulations on organic agriculture by undermining the rule of the law – allowing synthetic ingredients on a regular basis and misnamed inert ingredients in pesticides to be used on organic agriculture ? even when avoid meat and colas , we will still get more phosphorous from roundup sprayed agriculture . when cannot grow all our own food in the city and in small city lots ! oh my god … the ways we are … thanks darryl for your interesting post.i am wondering about the connection between two recent articles that you cited and the upper limit on phosphorus intake provided by the 1997 iom report pg . 187 , which was 4g per day for adults – way above the median intakes.unless i am mistaken , 1- the juno paper seems to focus on human aortic smooth muscle cell ( hsmc ) cultured in media containing phosphate levels comparable to those seen in hyperphosphatemic individuals ( > 1.4 mmol / l ) . if this is only a simulation of blood conditions , i don ’ t know if it really challenges the iom ’ s numbers , which concern intake of phosphorus.2. the shuto paper seems to focus on flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery before and 2 hrs after meals containing 400 mg or 1200 mg of phosphorus . not only does this dose of phosphorus seem quite high for a given meal even by american standards , but the effects being described are only acute endothelial effects – right ? , so i am not sure this challenges the iom ’ s numbers if they are based on likelihood of developing hyperphosphatemia.maybe i have misunderstood something … what are your thoughts ? 1200 mg phosphorous is a lot in one meal ( though 5 % of young men consume twice as much daily ) . on the other hand , its also the amount in 5 oz of velveeta ( all the processed cheeses are high ) . in 8 of 11 young ( 25 year old ) men , the high p meal raised phosphate to > 1.5 mm , which appears to be into the range of direct adverse effects on endothelium ( elevated reactive oxygen species , diminished flow mediated dilation , increased calcification ) seen in vitro in the two papers . older people tend to have lower phosphate diets ( less cheese nachos ? ) , but they also have slower hormonal signalling and lesser kidney function – perhaps their postprandial peaks would be higher.the lead source for this video offers a potential indirect mechanism for harm to bones . excess serum phosphorus is regulated by bone cells releasing hormone fgf23 to increase urinary excretion . fgf23 also suppresses cacitriol ( active vitamin-d ) synthesis , leading to elevated parathyroid hormone release and secondary hyperparathyroidism . i ’ ve no idea whether a high phosphorous diet , in the absence of kidney disease , would require enough urinary regulation via fgf23 to cause bone weakness.this is very good for learningwow ! now i better understand why i have osteoporosis.how long as this practice been going on – injection in meat ? and with soft drinks , has it gone on as long as the 1950 ’ s , when soft drinks became really popular ? or , earlier ? i ’ ve read that “ many fertilizers contain a high proportion of phosphorus and are manufactured from concentrated phosphoric acids . worldwide demand for fertilizers has greatly increased in recent years as their importance to agriculture and farming has grown . ” http : / / www.rsc.org / periodic-table / element / 15 / phosphorusisn ’ t roundup , trademark , glyphosate made with an abundant amount of phosphorus ? with genetically engineered crops and some so-called biologic * recombinant dna ” genetically engineered pharmaceuticals that are alleged to build bone also using phosphorous ( which i refused to take for other reasons ) , no wonder so many americans have diseases and ailments which europeans do not have.this research has really opened my eyes further.thanks dr. greger ! ! ! ! phosphorous in fertilizer ( including organic ones ) is a required plant nutrient that is part of organically bound plant dna , rna , atp , cell membranes phospholipids , and in plant seeds , phytic acid . the concern in this video is the inorganic phosphate salts used as preservatives , acidifying agents , acidity buffers , and emulsifying agents . unlike organically bound phosphates , these are quickly absorbed in the gut , leading to postprandial serum spikes.the eu has approved many inorganic phosphates for food use : eg . ( e 339 ) , potassium phosphate ( e 340 ) , calcium phosphate ( e 341 ) , salts of orthophosphoric acid diphosphate ( e 450 ) , triphosphate ( e 451 ) , and polyphosphate ( e 452 ) for their food system , and i haven ’ t come across evidence their intakes are substantially different from american ones.just curious . are phosphate additives added to certified organic chicken / turkey as well ? not that i am planning to eat any meat againadd cancer to the list : jin , hua , et al . “ high dietary inorganic phosphate increases lung tumorigenesis and alters akt signaling . ” american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine 179.1 ( 2009 ) : 59.you responded to a post of mine about tricalcium phosphate additive in almond milk . you came up with a calculated amount , which i believe was on the order of 150 mg.just wanted to give you a nutrition label comparison i found on almond milks , one using calcium carbonate and the other tricalcium phosphate . the former was 2 % of rda for phosphorous and the later was 4 % or rda ( per 8 oz . ) now my internet search on rda came up with 700 mg for adults , a little different than you mention . anyway , 2 % is only 14 mg . it appears to me that the tricalcium phosphate is only adding 14 mg , which really is a trivial amount.you ’ re a font . love this . i ’ m here all day skipping about . . . .what an amazing site . what work was done here , gathering , assessing , relaying . i ’ m astounded and humbled , and grateful dr g.ruby : glad you were able to find the site . welcome aboard.at location 2 : 39 in the video , i see beer at the far right with 100 % absorption . however there was no mention of beer so i am wondering if beer is particularly dangerous ? darryl , does this mean that the calcium phosphate that is added to commercial soymilk is doing more harm than good for those of us with osteopenia / osteoporosis consuming soymilk to help boost the calcium in our diet ? there does not seem to be any other kind of calcium used in the soymilks available to me locally.most non-dairy milks use chalk ( calcium carbonate ) , with no phosphate , others use calcium phosphate ( which i prefer as it doesn ’ t add a chalky taste to soups ) . my understanding is the levels are fairly modest in most , however , a non-dairy productserving with 50 % of the calcium ai ( 500 mg ) in the form of calcium phosphate would provide 257 mg inorganic phosphate . those with normal kidney function can handle this amount without issue , but when levels approach 1200 mg p in a single meal , even healthy young kidneys are challenged . my concern is less with non-dairy milks , than with processed cheeses , as 1200 mg inorganic phosphorus is the amount in just 5 oz of velveeta ( where its used as an emulsifier . ) .ok , so it is both total amount , and amount at one time , that is at issue . very helpful – many thanks. aging , animal products , antinutrients , beef , bone fractures , bone health , bone mineral density , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , coca-cola , cola , food additives , glycotoxins , heart disease , heart failure , heart health , hormonal dysfunction , iron , junk food , kidney disease , kidney failure , kidney function , kidney health , lifespan , longevity , meat , mortality , osteoporosis , phosphate additives , phosphorus , phytates , phytic acid , plant-based diets , pork , poultry , preservatives , soda , turkey , vegans , vegetarians the consumption of phosphorus preservatives in junk food and injected into meat may damage blood vessels , accelerate the aging process , and contribute to osteoporosis . here ’ s a direct link to my kidney video : treating kidney failure through diet . and my discussion of plant versus animal iron sources : risk associated with iron supplements.another toxic addition to alter the color of meat is arsenic-containing drugs fed directly to chickens . see my video arsenic in chicken . carbon monoxide is used to keep red meat red , anthoxanthins keep salmon pink ( artificial coloring in fish ) and titanium dioxide is used to whiten processed foods ( titanium dioxide & inflammatory bowel disease ) . it ’ s amazing the risks the food industry will take to alter food cosmetically ( artificial food colors and adhd ) .there are other harmful additives in soda as well ( is sodium benzoate harmful ? and diet soda and preterm birth ) .what else is in poultry purge ( chicken “ juice ” ) ? find out ( if you dare ! ) in my next video , phosphate additives in chicken.for more context , check out my associated blog post : what do meat purge and cola have in common ?
PLAIN-2689	enhanced athletic recovery without undermining adaptation ultramarathon runners may generate so many free radicals during a race that they can damage the dna of a significant percentage of their cells . now some have looked on the exercise-induced increase in free radical production as a paradox : why would an apparently healthy act , exercise , lead to detrimental effects through damage to various molecules and tissues . this is somewhat of a misunderstanding as exercise in and of itself is not necessarily the healthy act , it 's the recovery after exercise that is so healthy . the whole that-which-doesn 't-kill-us-makes-us-stronger notion . for example , exercise training has been shown to enhance antioxidant defenses by increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes . so yeah during the race ultra-marathoners may be taking hits to their dna , but check out a week later.six days after the race , they didn 't just go back to the baseline level of dna damage , they had significantly less , presumably because they had so revved up their antioxidant defenses . so maybe exercise-induced oxidative damage is beneficial , kinda like vaccination . by freaking out the body a little , maybe you 'll induce a response that 's favorable in the long run . this concept that low levels of a damaging entity can up-regulate protective mechanisms is known as hormesis . for example , herbicides kill plants . but in tiny doses … may actually boost plant growth , presumably by stressing the plant into rallying its resources to successfully fight back.wait a second , though . could then eating anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant rich plant foods undermine this adaptation response ? we saw that berries could reduce inflammatory muscle damage ; and greens could reduce the free radical dna damage . dark chocolate and tomato juice may have similar effects . the flavonoid phytonutrients in fruits , vegetables and beans appear to inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase , considered the main contributor of free radicals during exercise . and the carbs in plant foods may decrease stress hormone levels.so in 1999 , a theoretical concern was raised . maybe all that free radical stress from exercise is a good thing , and increased consumption of some antioxidant nutrients might interfere with these necessary adaptive processes . so if you decrease the free radical tissue damage , maybe you don 't get that increase in activity of those antioxidant enzymes.the cherry researchers responded , look , although it is likely that muscle damage , inflammation and oxidative stress are important factors in the adaptation process , minimizing these factors may improve recovery so you can train more and perform better . so , there are theories on both sides , but what happens when you actually put it to the test ? what does the data show ? while antioxidant or anti-inflammatory supplements may prevent these adaptive events , researchers found that a berry extract — black currant in this study , although packed with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties actually augmented — boosted the health benefits of regular exercise even further.you take antioxidant pills — vitamin c and vitamin e supplements and you can also reduce the stress levels induced by exercise , but in doing so you block that boost in antioxidant enzyme activity caused by exercise . now maybe you don 't need that boost if you don 't have as much damage , but vitamin c supplements may impair physical performance in the first place . whereas with plant foods , you appear to get the best of both worlds.check out this recent study on lemon verbena , an antioxidant-rich herbal tea . it protects against oxidative damage and decreases the signs of muscular damage and inflammation , all without blocking the cellular adaptation to exercise . they showed that lemon verbena does not affect the increase of the antioxidant enzyme response promoted by exercise . on the contrary , glutathione reductase activity was even higher in the lemon verbena group . here 's the level of antioxidant enzyme activity before and after 21 days of intense running exercises in the control group . with all the free radical damage that caused , the body started cranking up its antioxidant defenses . but give a dark green leafy tea , and not only do you put akabosh on the damage due to all the phytonutrients and antioxidants , but you still get the boost in defenses — in fact , in this case , even better . i ’ ll swim , bike and run to that ! ! ! your tireless work has helped so many , including those of the original hawai ’ i october ironman world championships which just completed last weekend . cheers to good health ! this is great news for athletes . for performance and for health , plants rule.a plant only diet is superior in nearly all health areas . one area of concern is with elite athletes regarding tendon strength and ply-ability which often is neglected in a plant only diet . complex b-vitamins and other specific proteins needed for tendon health ( readily available in meat proteins ) have been challenging to replace adequately in plant only diets leading to statistically significant tendon failures ( ruptures ) . this is particularly evident in athletes competing in anaerobic events.coach rich ( elite competitive runner + 44years , track & field coach + 25years ) hi ric , which foods / supplements do you recommend for tendon repair ? i already take protein as meat , i am not vegetarian . thanks.gabriel – am not prone to giving advice outside of my direct oversight and responsibility of athletes i coach and work with . in general i can say that i am very supportive of high plant diet content and support 100 % plant diets for those that are not competitive high performance athletes . my experience is real world over 40 + years that few can match . i am a nationally certified coach , an engineer with significant scientific and sport medicine background ( but i am not a doctor ) . i am generally not a big supporter of supplements since they seeks to short cut the body ’ s use of great naturally available nutrients that ingest and metabolize more effectively and safely in the athlete ’ s body.ligaments and tendons are made primarily of collagen , which our bodies make from non-essential amino acids . vitamin c plays an important role in collagen synthesis . the only b vitamin at issue with non-meat eaters would be b12 – mostly among vegans . all ingested protein is broken down into the individual amino acids that comprise them – regardless of source – and only then does our body begin to utilize it . apples , black beans , broccoli , a baked potato , peanut butter , and a million other non-meat foods contain “ complete ” proteins that supply all essential amino acids our bodies need to assemble our own proteins . by what mechanism does a plant only diet lead to more tendon failures ? short answer – its a matter of science vs engineering . it ’ s a matter of real world practice vs the theory . btw – it ’ s not just what your body is made of . in the real world , based on what your “ machine ” is doing , getting the correct availability of specific building blocks at the right time is the key to prevent injury in high performance athletes . sorry for the brevity , if you were one of my athletes we would spend quite a bit of time on this.but you claimed statistical significance in the rate of tendon injuries among those eating a plant only diet , and statistical significance is not something typically associated with anecdotal evidence … .but rather evidence-based scientific research . i was hoping you ’ d share your source so i could take a look and evaluate the data . if it ’ s a matter of noticing patterns over the course of your career , then that ’ s another matter … .and i am tempted to point out that the runner in the picture for the video is scott jurek , who i assume you know is the greatest ultramarathon runner of all time , and also a vegan.and rich rollac – sorry for my lack of clarity . i was trying to clarify that anecdotal is not statistically relevant as i run across “ one up ” examples all the time . i agree that vegan suits well for aerobic events , scott is a great case in point . little of my experience has been with marathon or ultra marathon athletes but with shorter distances ~ 1500m , sprints , jumps and other anaerobic events . a good part my experience is pattern identification over enough data be relevant . to your point it isn ’ t a scientific study involving controls . in the 1990s there were a few university sports articles on vegan diets and tendon injuries.again i have to ask . how many vegan / vegetarians have you come across ? and of the few you have seen you can say they have torn tendon ? very relevant question . 2 vegans , one with a torn tendon , means that 50 % of the vegans have weak tendons.oh goodness . you are so funny . but you got my point.it seems to me that rich got a phd in bro science.thanks adrien – i ’ ll take that as a compliment to the many athletes ( some of them “ bros ” ) i ’ ve had the privilege of supporting.hi ac – yes you nailed one of the issues b12.interesting , but we need references – “ statistically significant “ ? in this context i mean non anecdotal and non random outlier data . i ’ ll have to do some digging to find published references ( it ’ s been quite a while ) . my experience of coaching 1000s of athletes over + 20 years at all levels from highschool through world class olympians ( as well as my 40 + year extensive racing career – and still going ) has demonstrated an increase tendon failure rate of over 3-4x with vegan athletes over typical dieters ( i.e. animal meat eaters ) . mostly in the legs and abdominal areas . there are of course many positive influences of plant diets . this problem area is very critical for safe high explosive performance ( you might say it is an achilles heal of sorts , no pun intended ) . you can search a related tendon failure mechanism related to younger women ( 16 – 30 ) during menstrual cycles – this is well documented through scientific studies over the past 30 years and relates to low of ply-ability ( and temporary brittleness of said tendons ) due to specific hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle . it ’ s not the same thing as i am referencing above , but there is some significant understanding to temporary loss of tendon robustness that is relevant to this topic.does anyone here know carl lewis ? he is a vegan and if anyone on this message board knows him personally , maybe you could reach out to him and ask him his experience , in this regard , with his own body / tendons and with other elite olympians he has trained with over the years . from what i know , carl is still vegan and going strong.elsie – thanks for your feedback . yes , i am very familiar with carl and his vegan diet . he wasn ’ t always a vegan . carl has a very rare muscle composition which complimented his high performance for a longer period than most sprint ( anaerobic event ) athletes . vegan is an excellent choice for post competitive athletes , and you are right there isn ’ t much ( if any ) long term data . my experience with 1000s of athletes shows significant challenges . let me make a very crude comparison ( please do not take this as an endorsement of any kind ) – let ’ s say that high nutrient red meat is a form of performance enhancement drug ( i won ’ t even mention the name but you know what drugs i ’ m referring ) . an athlete can take in this high content red matter and quickly build strength and robustness while training . but it comes at a cost – long term ( and sometimes short term too ) which can greatly damage the body beyond repair . my experience of success uses a safe balance which results in great performance and longevity in a practical way . look at some of my other postings to gain additional background . just remember that knowledge comes by using great wisdom in testing and evaluating the data ( and not all data is equal ) . best of success to you.rich , why is it that there are vegan athletes out there that dominate their sport of choice ? it has to make the meat-eater wonder , hey maybe i should go vegan ? is it that some of these vegan athletes are so gifted that it doesn ’ t matter what they eat ? genetics are a primary factor , as are mental drive , spirit , experience , and life style choices . vegan can be good , but it is not a magic bullet . do your research , peek performance isn ’ t all science and competitive success isn ’ t that simple.rich , i just want to compliment you in how well you word your answers . you may not be a doctor but you are a bright individual and well spoken . i on the other hand hold a doctorate degree and only recently ( 18 months or so ) have my eyes been open to the athletic improvements by eating a primarily plant based minimal processed food diet . hence , despite my degree i was quite ignorant on this subject matter previously . here ’ s to plants and to an occasional bite off my girlfriend ’ s meat based protein plate . ; ) elsie : that ’ s a reasonable question . i don ’ t know the answer about long term data . but i thought since we were all sharing anecdotes , i would remind readers that there ’ s more than just one or two seriously competitive vegan athletes out there , some who have been vegan for many years . — — — — — — — — - ( from meatout mondays ) vegan bodybuilders dominate texas competitionthe plant built ( plantbuilt.com ) team rolled into this year ’ s drug-free , steroid-free naturally fit super show competition in austin , tx , and walked away with more trophies than even they could carry.the plant built team of 15 vegan bodybuilders competed in seven divisions , taking first place in all but two . they also took several 2nd and 3rd place wins.for more info : http : / / www.plantbuilt.com / — — — — — — — when robert cheeke started veganbodybuilding.com in 2002 , being the only vegan athlete he knew of , he may not have imagined that the website would quickly grow to have thousands of members . robert says , “ we ’ re discovering new vegan athletes all the time , from professional and elite levels … to weekend warriors and everyone in between . ” for more info : http : / / www.veganbodybuilding.com / — — — — — – there was that other guy who just did a world record in weight lifting . “ congratulations to strongman patrik baboumian who yesterday took a ten metre walk carrying more than half a tonne on his shoulders , more than anyone has ever done before . after smashing the world record the strongman let out a roar of ‘ vegan power ’ … ” for more info : http : / / www.onegreenplanet.org / news / vegan-strongman-patrik-babaoumain-breaks-world-record / — — — — — – here ’ s another site that i like : http : / / www.greatveganathletes.com / i found this story on the above site : “ pat reeves has set a new world powerlifting record at the wdfpa world single lift championships . the 66 year old lifter , who has been vegan for 46 years , lifted 94 kg to set a record for the under 50.5kg weight class while competing in france in june 2012 . the lift was more than 1.85 times her bodyweight , which is exceptional for her division . pat is now officially the oldest competing weightlifter in europe . ” hope everyone finds this helpful.thea , thanks for posting all this stuff.and bodybuilders need strong tendonsi work with athletes . and i have never come across a vegan athlete . so if coach rich has coached 1000 runners which is not difficult if you have a high school team with 120 runners , i can ‘ t imagine he has actually come across vegans with torn tendons . and better yet , there are so many meat eaters who are running and tearing tendons ! the sport is ridiculously intense . that causes injured runners . especially when they are 16 and growing.veganrunner : that was also my thought , but you express it with some authority that i lack . it ’ s my guess that rich is really basing his comments on those magazine articles that he read decades ago . and who knows what those articles were based on ? thanks for chiming in.and i am sure he is an absolutely wonderful coach ! we need more people willing to dedicate their time to the high schools . it is often time a thankless job and parents can be so difficult to work with . ; - ) my thought exactly.a whole foods plant based diet based complex carbohydrates can provide plenty of b vitamins and there is no whole plant food that is missing an amino acid , as all whole plant foods contain all the essential amino acids . if you are referring to the fact that whole plant foods have different ratios of amino acids then animal products , this is also not a concern . getting all the amino acids in at once at the same meal , or even in the same day , as some may suggest , is not necessary due to the amino acid pool , which is a circulating level of amino acids in the blood , that the body can draw from if needed . as long as one follows a whole foods plant based diet , the amino acid pool will maintain a sufficient stock of any potentially needed ( or limiting ) amino acids . “ a plant only diet is superior in nearly all health areas . ” mmmm … could it be that maybe humans were designed to eat just a plant-only diet ? ( : maybe that is what your experience is and that is interesting if it could be scientifically proven but all the evidence points to the weakest tendons in those with decreased blood flow to the areas in question : poor blood flow = poor tendon health = increased risk of tendon rupture ( also those that use anabolic steroids have very high rates of tendon ruptures ) . the persons with the poorest blood flow will be those with the poorest diet , and the worst substance to put into the body from many perspectives ( cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer , athletic performance ) is meat , eggs and dairy , because the excess protein , saturated fat , and cholesterol ( among many other destructive molecules phip , neu5gc , viruses , bacteria , etc ) cause a chronic low level of inflammation.chronic mlow level inflammation ( meta-inflammation ) is destructive to our bodies ! and low level inflammation decreases blood flow to working tendons and muscles , causing earlier fatigue.it ’ s important to remember vessel size in regards to blood flow : blood flow is proportional to the blood vessel radius to the fourth power , meaning a 2 fold decrease ( or increase ) to the radius results in a 16 fold decrease ( or increase ) to flow respectively . inflammation reduces blood flow ! with regards to anaerobic work and plant based lifestyles : tony gonzalez , tight-end kansas city chiefs which holds the record for most catches and touchdowns for tight ends in the nfl billy simmonds the 2009 mr. natural universe — plant based joe kirkillis , bodybuilder , plant based and now patrik baboumian , vegan strongman , record for most weight carried 10 meters 550kg ( 1172 lbs ) and of course 6 time ironman champion dave scott all done while vegan . if i remember correctly all the times he didn ’ t achieve first place he was not vegan.and there are other numerous vegetarian / vegan athletes that have performed very well : carl lewis ( vegan ) billy jean king , martina navratalova , robert parish , joe namath and the list is growing.vegan athletics is very doable . and i fail to see in the literature and in my own anecdotal experience the increase in tendon ruptures related to veganism.it may not be for everyone , and that is because of their own values but not because of the scientific evidence , and there is some tweaking about eating enough calories for these athletes , but if done correctly appears to be quite superior to any other lifestyle for not only athletic performance but achieving the healthiest lifestyle known to date.this is what many researcher ’ s and scientist ’ s have shown but the most notable are : dean ornish , md , caldwell esselstyn , md , t. colin campbell , phd , neal barnard , md , john mcdougall , md , and of course michael greger , md.good morning dr hemo , len miller is one of our most famous running coaches . he has coached many of our olympic athletes and he coached steve scott throughout his running career . he is a friend of mine and we have had this same conversation regarding his runners . he just read jureks book and it seemed to have broadened his thinking.keep it up ! i don ’ t say much to people about eating healthy unless they ask or are in my office . and sometimes i use the , “ it may not work for you but it works for me . ” statement to deflect direct criticism.that said , last week i had a young patient get really irate and almost throw a punch at me because i wouldn ’ t give him opiates for his acid reflux . he had just been discharged from the er for severe stomach and chest pain which they determined was gerd ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ) . and he was clearly altered by pain medication while in my office – glazed over eyes and slowed responses.i explained to him the physiology of the acid production of eating animal foods vs. plant foods . i had to explain this multiple times because he wasn ’ t wanting to understand what i was saying because it didn ’ t fit into his malingering needs.but eventually he repeated back to me , “ i have all this pain and you ’ re sitting here telling me to stop eating all meat , and dairy and to start taking prilosec and that will fix all the pain i have ! ? ! that ’ s a bunch of crap and i want something for my pain ! ” while in the office he was such an a $ $ hole to his wife , whom he kicked out of the room by yelling at her and told her to leave and go to the lobby , and belligerent towards me that i just stated he is going to have to find another doctor to take care of his needs and yes , “ no i will not prescribe pain meds for your gerd ! ” but veganrunner , the more we get the word out the less the world will challenge the benefits of eating a plant based diet ! dr hemo i feel for you . most of my patients are back patients so opiates are often prescribed . poor guy . he must think you are crazy ! dr. hemo , you still there ? could you explain this a bit more ? why does the excess protein , sat fat , etc. tell the immune system to rush in and create inflammation ? and why do the blood vessels then reduce in size ? thanks for all your helpful comments.dr. hemo , could you explain this a bit more ? why does the excess protein , sat fat , etc. tell the immune system to rush in and create inflammation ? and why do the blood vessels then reduce in size ? thanks for all your helpful comments.hi coach rich , as a runner , mother of young competitive runners , and an orthopedic physical therapist imho the problem is the intensity of the sport . have you actually ran into that many runners who don ’ t eat meat ? we are a rarity.only a few dozen athletes but growing in the past decade . it ’ s a small percentage of those i ’ ve coached ( but with disproportionate injuries ) . training & diets have evolved significantly since the 70s ( when i began ) . my baseline is decades of experience and it iterates conservatively . continued learning may lead me to a plant only solution , but i ’ m not there yet . coaching & running is my passion and i strive to keep improving . enjoy the journey with your kids.wow. more than i would of thought.there are so few research articles on running . i would bet 0 on vegan runners and tendon injury . some on mechanics of course but injury , not so much.you would be surprised.here is a wonderful 5-minute totally paleosafe video that explains how strenuous exercise generates free radicals that damage dna , but the recovery process more than makes up for it . antioxidant supplements like vitamin c and e pills ( unavailable to the caveman ) may actually interfere with the recovery process as shown in some studies , while the phytonutrients in plants are shown to greatly enhance it . another blow to the supplement industry.the only “ magic bullet ” i know of , is made of broccoli … .danielfaster : that was a really nice summary . i appreciated it . and actually , i had read your comment before watching the video . i think your comment helped me absorb the information in the video better . thanks ! hello ! can you please do video about controlling asthma with nutrition. greetings from slovenia ! jurij – so cool that someone from slovenia is tuned in . welcome to the group ! yes . this is “ the invasion of the planteaters ” : - ) i just forwarded this to my husband who is competing in a cyclocross competition as we speak . plants are the best ! i have a colleague who is running more than 100 km per. week without any problems . i think he attributes his stamina to wfpdabsolutely . and recovery is faster . both rolls ’ and jureks ’ books were the last push i needed , along with my nutrition facts.org friends to push me into the abyss.actually rich rolls book inspired me to do much more cardio – and my nf friends help me stay on track . no support in the md community – sad but true . and i appreciate your comments on nf.well thank you plantstrong . oh i know . most mds think i am nuts but that is ok . they also can ’ t argue with the fact that we are ridiculously healthy . one of my doctors just said to me , “ but most people can ’ t do what you do . ” what is that ? why do people make the choice to eat crap and be unhealthy ? it baffles me . or to not exercise.i learned nothing at all about nutrition and health in medschool , doctors dont talk about it , and probably dont care . i have worked in a stroke unit , and nutrition was never mentioned . actually it was a coincidence , that i came across the subject of wfpd and health , but i immediately got interested . mds know about diseasecare , not healthcare.i hate to bag on doctors because i work with you guys on a daily basis but you are so right . what is really interesting now is that they are starting to talk about the importance of movement . like that concept is something new ! and prevention . well i am glad they are starting to show up . better late than never.exercise is also important . the most common injury among modern man is probably – and sadly – repetitive strain injury from using the computer , and lumbago from reaching out for the tv-dinner … .. found it. http : / / findingultra.com / mobile / index.phpwho said vegans can ’ t be tough ! it 's a great story – and he 's tough ! did you ever watch the video he released to promote his book ? he looks amazing doing butterfly across the pool . i look at that and i want some – good health not rich . ; - ) i agree , although anecdotal , i am a competitive climber and i have noticed significant endurance gains since going pant based.very true toxins but we so rarely sway – it ’ s fun every so often to remind each other how great we feel ! i need less sleep since going plantstrong.in regards to sleep , what i noticed was that i had high energy all day , until it was time to sleep at night . then i was hit by a wave of tiredness and had to sleep or risk being a mindless zombie.approximately how many of gms of dried lemon verbena leaves was utilized / day ? i can see from the second page of the lemon verbena / cytokine article that an extract was prepared . but only pages 1-2 are available for free online . is there enough information in the rest of the article to roughly estimate the amount of dried leaves that would be equivalent to the extract and how often it was ingested ? thanks for the excellent video ! i wonder whether pure freeze dried montmorency cherry capsules would count as food , or as a supplement ? i take these to improve my post-exercise recovery and don ’ t want to think it is counter-productive ! surely it is the same as eating the cherries ( just more convenient and cheaper ) and therefore ok ? i would be interested to know thoughts on this … .i like the hormesis way of thinking . radiation hormesis strengthens the immune system.i do eat a vegan diet , but also take a freeze-dried cherry supplement to speed exercise recovery – this is just pure freeze-dried cherries in a capsule , nothing else . ( cheaper and easier than eating pounds of cherries ! ! ) would this count as food and therefore be ok ? or would it behave like a supplement in undermining the benefits of exercise recovery ? i would be interested in thoughts on this … great video , thank you ! you mention “ the right time ” of getting blackcurrant or / and cherry juice . what is this right time for runners ? is it before running or during the workout ? best regards , martai love this website and the analysis , and making research available to all . that said , this was a very difficult video to follow , and since i have analysed it in more detail , i ’ m a bit disappointed . there is a claim that “ plant foods offer the best of both worlds ” , yet , it is based on one study of athletes who took a lemon verbena tea supplement . so , they weren ’ t eating the plant , and i don ’ t think they were even drinking the tea . as a supplement , wouldn ’ t that imply that it has been processed ( like the vit c supplement , that impaired physical performance in athletes ? ) vit c is obviously in a lot of plants , too . i would say the claim that plant foods offer the best of both worlds is unsubstantiated by the evidence provided in this analysis.hello , this is not really a question specific to this video , but i am curious as to any other websites that focus more on exercise that you would give your approval to . i essentially use this website as my end all for any question that arises nutritionally , and i wish i had a similar ‘ encyclopedia ’ to reference when wondering about more fitness related questions.dear dr. greger , you mentioned black currant in this video and its antioxidant content activity . there is an antioxidant substance in black currant which appears to be especially interesting : keracyanin ( sambucin , cyanidin 3-rutinoside , meralop , ( same as antirrhinin ? ) ) . it is an antioxidant and appears to inhibit some proteases ( mmp1 , mmp9 , neutrophil elastase ) , protecting erythrocytes from apoptosis , but inducing apoptosis in the highly tumorigenic re-149 dhd cell line . when added to food , keracyanin chloride significantly reduces body weight gain , resistance to insulin , and lipid accumulation in mice fed a high-fat diet . i think this is an interesting topic on its own , what about producing a video on keracyanin , a polyphenolic anthocyanin found in black currants and other plants ? you find references here at a research product vendor site : https : / / www.caymanchem.com / app / template / product.vm / catalog / 15778keep rockin it dr. greger . your work is both informative and inspirational . i ’ m gonna go get a good 10 miler and a green smoothie ! thank you for all that you and your team do ! ! yeah the marriott got it covered for me ! http : / / www.nih.gov / news / health / jan2015 / nimh-19.htmhttp : / / www.soulradiouk.com / there was a story today in the daily mail ( and elsewhere ) on how jogging is only good for us at a moderate pace , around three times a week . more intense runs are reported to shorten lifespan as much as sedentary living ; could this be attributed to oxidative stress ? http : / / www.dailymail.co.uk / health / article-2936615 / too-jogging-just-bad-doing-none-short-run-three-time-week-key-longer-life.htmln.b. : i haven ’ t looked into the studies behind the stories in the popular press , so take this with a pinch of salt ! antioxidants , beans , berries , beverages , cherries , chocolate , currants , dna damage , exercise , flavonoids , fruit , fruit juice , greens , herbal tea , hormesis , inflammation , juice , lemon verbena , muscle health , muscle inflammation , oxidative stress , plant-based diets , supplements , tea , tomato juice , tomatoes , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , vitamin c , vitamin e might the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of plant-based diets undermine some of the benefits of exercise ? more on enhancing athletic recovery in my recent three-part video series : then there ’ s my 15-video series on using nitrate-rich vegetables to boost athletic performance starting with doping with beet juice and ending with so should we drink beet juice or not ? more examples of plants over pills in : if it ’ s lemon verbena ’ s antioxidant content , then there may be a better option . see the healthiest herbal tea and better than green tea ? i ’ ll continue this thread in my next video , preserving immune function in athletes with nutritional yeast.for more context , check out my associated blog post : how to boost the benefits of exercise .
PLAIN-269	preventing and treating kidney failure with diet our kidneys are highly vascular organs . that ’ s why when you see kidneys in the meat case they look so red . after all , our two little kidneys have to filter through our entire blood supply and as such receive about 20 % of our cardiac output every time our heart beats . so if the standard american diet can be so toxic to the blood vessels in our heart , back , abdomen , and pelvis , contributing to heart attacks ( heart attacks and cholesterol : purely a question of diet ) , spinal disc degeneration ( cholesterol and lower back pain ) , aneurisms ( abdominal aortic aneurysms : ticking time balloons ) , and sexual dysfunction ( cholesterol and female sexual dysfunction ) , what might it be doing to our kidneys ? in my 2-min. video , preventing kidney failure through diet , i profile a recent harvard study putting that question to the test . thousands of women , their diets , and their kidney function were followed for a decade . the researchers found three significant risk factors for declining kidney function in these women ; none of which come as a surprise given that we ’ re talking about clogged and inflamed blood vessels : animal protein , animal fat , and cholesterol . all three of these risk factors are only found in animal-based foods . no such association was found for plant protein or plant fat . failing kidneys can be a canary in a coal mine , informing us about the health of our blood vessels . quoting from the harvard study , “ modest decrements in kidney function are powerfully associated with subsequent overt kidney disease , cardiovascular risk , and all-cause mortality , ” meaning a shortened lifespan . “ in summary , diets lower in animal protein , animal fat , and cholesterol may be protective ” against this kind of kidney damage . what if the damage has already been done , and you ’ re already suffering from chronic renal failure ? that ’ s the subject of my video treating kidney failure through diet . one of the important functions of our kidneys is to filter out excess phosphorus from our bloodstream , and so when our kidney function declines , phosphorus can build up in our bodies and cause something called metastatic calcification , where your heart valves and muscles and other parts of your body can buildup calcium deposits and eventually result in skin necrosis , gangrene , and amputations . so , if a person has diminished kidney function their doctor will likely put them on a low phosphate diet , which is tough , because basically everything with protein has phosphorus . so both plant foods and animal foods have phosphorus . but vegans have been shown to have significantly better kidney function , on average , compared to omnivores . so while researchers concluded that “ these results can confirm the usefulness of vegetarianism here and support the use of a vegan diet for the patients with kidney failure , ” maybe it was just because the omnivores were getting a higher protein load . we know that lower protein diets appear to delay the progression of kidney failure , so did the plant based diet help because they were eating less protein or because the body somehow is able to handle plant protein better than animal protein ? to do that you ’ d have to split people into two groups , half on a vegetarian diet , half not , with the critical caveat to make sure both groups eat the exact same amount of protein and the exact same amount of phosphorus . and that ’ s exactly what researchers did . published recently in the journal of the american society of nephrology , they took vegetarians and put them on a meat diet , and then took meat-eaters and put them on a vegetarian diet . even though phosphorus and protein intake were kept the same in both diet groups , in the video you can see an illustration of the level of phosphorus stuck in the bloodstream of those on the meat diet , compared to those on the veg diet . something about plant foods appears to enable our bodies to better handle their phosphorus content . plant phosphorus appears easier to cleanse away . positive results have been seen with even semi-vegetarian diets , but the reason the new study “ observed more dramatic differences after only 1 week , was perhaps because of the pure vegetarian diets used in our study . taken together , vegetarian-based diets may be beneficial for the control of phosphorus balance in patients with chronic kidney disease . ” if we need another reason to eat a plant-based diet this would be a good one to add to the exhaustive list.thank you for great information presented in in easily digestible fashion . love the videos too ! a good video , but my compputer had you speaking over yourself about a different topic . i ’ m not sure if everyone has this problem , but i did , and it ’ s under no other e-mail i have ever read.hi michael , i am a great fan of the extraordinary work you do . i have 4 questions for you : 1- in the spanish study , crossover study of diets enriched with virgin olive oil , walnuts or almonds . effects on lipids and other cardiovascular risk markers , how significant are the results of this study considering the fact that the groups went from a baseline intake of cholesterol of 231 mg / d to about 130 mg / d when they change from their regular diet to the experimental diet with olive oil or nuts ? 2- when you attended mcdougall adavance weekend last february you were going to ask a question following fuhrman ’ s and mcdougall ’ s debate . i am curious to know what you were going to ask ? i am assuming that you are not a great supporter of mcdougall ’ s high cho diet . 3- contrary to mcdougall dr. willett from harvard substantiates well the need for pufa and mufa in the diet . what is your take on willett position ? 4- what is the risk for vegans who eat the way you suggest to become deficinet in dha , as reported by fuhrman ? thank you for taking the time to answer these questions , andré sainedr . greger , thank you for all that you do.is there any risk in worsening chronic kidney disease with a vegan diet , due to the increased potassium in plant foods ? if someone has diminished gfr , would the extra potassium from plants overwhelm there glomeruli or would it bring their kidney function back ? thank you.i still don ’ t understand if a diabetic with kidney problems can still eat plant-based protein or should plant-based proteins be eliminated as well ? when one reads about a renal diet , which is low protein , are nutritional guidelines including plant-based proteins or not ? can ’ t figure this out ! icarole : i can ’ t comment on your specific condition of diabetes * and * kidney problems . ( what a bummer ) . but i did want to respond to this part of your comment : “ can still eat plant-based protein or should plant-based proteins be eliminated as well ? ” i don ’ t think the question fully makes sense since all plant foods have protein . you might be surprised at how much protein even veggies have . so , unless you were planning on never eating plants , you can ’ t eliminate plant based proteins . you could try to eat plants that only have less proteins , but then you would be missing out on some super-healthy foods – foods that in general are less in protein than animal foods i believe . so , i don ’ t see how you could go wrong eating them ? ? ? ( i ’ m not a doctor and don ’ t know about advising you for your specific condition . ) for a really great tutorial in understanding proteins and our need for it and how much plants of all types have , check out this awesome page : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmli hope this helped at least a little . good luck. animal fat , animal protein , cholesterol , harvard study , heart attacks , kidney , meat , plant fat , plant protein , standard american diet - -
PLAIN-2699	treating multiple sclerosis with the swank ms diet multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable and frightening degenerative autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system in which your body attacks your own nerves . it often strikes in the prime of life and can cause symptoms in the brain--cognitive impairment , in the eye--painful loss of vision , tremor , weakness , loss of bladder control , pain , and fatigue.the most frequently prescribed drug , for multiple sclerosis is beta interferon , which can make you feel lousy and cost $ 30,000 a year , but hey--it might be worthwhile if , it actually worked . we learned last year that it doesn 't seem to prevent or delay long-term disability.that leaves chemo drugs like mitoxantrone that causes irreversible heart damage in 1 out of every 8 people who go on the drug and treatment-related acute leukemia — it causes leukemia in nearly 1 % of people who take it . but hey , ms is no walk in the park . if only there was a cheap , simple , safe , side effect free solution that also just so happened to be the most effective treatment for ms ever described.dr. roy swank , who we lost at age 99 was a distinguished neurologist whose research culminated in over 170 scientific papers . let 's look at a few.as far back as 1950 , we knew there were areas in the world that had a lot of ms--north america , europe — and other places — africa and asia — that hardly had any . and now we have all these migration studies showing that if you move from a high risk area to a low risk area your risk drops , and vice versa . so it seemed less genetics , and more lifestyle.dr. swank had an idea , as he recounts in an interview with dr. john mcdougall , at the ripe young age of 84 : " it seems possible to me that this could be a matter of food , because the further north you go the less vegetarian a life is led and the more people are carnivores you might say , they spend a lot more time eating meat . " after looking at the multiple sclerosis data from world war two in occupied countries where meat and dairy were rationed , and his famous study in ' 52 finding the frequency of ms directly related to the amount of saturated animal fat consumed daily in different areas of norway , he concluded it might be the animal fat , so he decided to put it to the test , by restricting people 's intake of saturated animal fat.here 's his first 47 patients before cutting out about 90 % of the saturated fat from their diet , and here 's after … showing a decrease in both the frequency and severity of ms attacks . normally , you 're lucky if you can get people to stick to a diet for 6 months , and so that 's why most dietary trials last a year at the most . this is reporting results from the first 3 and a half years.then came the 5 and a half year follow-up — he adds about another 100 patients . then the 7 year follow-up , published in the annals of internal medicine . then the 20 year follow-up , 34 year follow-up.how did they do ? if you can get to people early in their disease , when they 're only mildly disabled , and restrict their saturated fat intake , dr. swank showed he could stop their disease in 95 % of cases — no further disability 34 years later . but if they started slacking on their diet — even years in , their disease could become reactivated . they felt so great they were like hey i can cheat a little bit , i got this disease under control . but eating just 8 grams of saturated fat more a day was accompanied by a striking increase in disability and a near tripling of the death rate.how about a 50 year follow-up ! they were able to track down 15 of the original patients that stuck to the diet , now in their 70 's and 80 's , with multiple sclerosis for over 50 years , and 13 out of 15 , were walking around normal in all respects . they were active and , evidently , unusually youthful looking . conclusion : " this study indicated that , in all probability , ms is caused largely by consumption of saturated animal fat.he thought it was the sludging of the blood caused by even a single meal of saturated fats that can clog tiny capillaries that feed our nervous system . see diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol can thicken the blood , and make our red cells sticky . a single meal of sausage and eggs … can stick our blood cells together like rolls of quarters . and this kind of hyperaggregation can lead to a reduction of blood flow and oxygenation of our tissues.if you put someone 's blood through a machine that sucks out about 90 % of the cholesterol in their blood , you can demonstrate an immediate improvement in microcirculation in the heart muscle , but what about the brain ? the eyes are the windows … to your brain . you can visualize — in real-time — changes in blood vessel function in the retina at the back of the eye , which gives you a sense of what 's happening further back in the brain . and if you lower the cholesterol level in the blood , you can immediately get a significant improvement in vasodilation , the little veins open wider and let the blood flow.so yes , it could be the animal fat leading to clogging of our capillaries , but now we know animal fats can have all sorts of other deleterious effects such as inflammation , so who knows what the actual mechanism may be by which cutting animal fat can cut ms progression . regardless , patients with ms that follow a diet with no more than 10 or 15 grams of saturated fat can expect to survive and thrive to a ripe old age . of course cutting out saturated fat completely might be better , given that heart disease is our number one killer.the bottom line is that the results dr. swank published remain the most effective , treatment of multiple sclerosis ever reported in the peer reviewed medical literature . in patients with early stage ms , 95 % were without progression of their disease 34 years later after adopting his low saturated fat dietary program . even patients with initially advanced disease showed significant benefit . to date , no medication or invasive procedure has ever even come close , to demonstrating such success . " doesn 't cost $ 30,000 dollars ; doesn 't give you leukemia — and works , better ! of course this all begs one big obvious question : if dr. swanks results are so stunningly impressive , why haven ’ t other physicians , neurologists , or centers adopted this method of treatment ? good question.one reason may be that mri machines weren 't invented until the 1970s . mris are how we track the progress of ms today . we don 't have to rely on patients ’ subjective reports or doctor 's clinical judgements , we can see the disease get better or worse right there in black and white.it 's like in the 1970 's when nathan pritikin appeared to reverse heart disease by the thousands but no one took him seriously until angiography was invented and the likes of ornish and essylstein could hold up images like this , proving conclusively that a plant-based diet could literally open up arteries , right there in black and white.so what we need is someone to repeat swanks experiment today , with mri scans every step of the way … and , i 'm happy to report that exact experiment was just completed , by dr. john mcdougall . dr. swank was one of dr. mcdougall 's medical mentors , and dr. mcdougall is one of mine . study enrollment was completed last year and we should have the results sometime soon . is there anything in swank ’ s literature that draws distinctions or similarities between animal-based saturated fats vs. plant-based saturated fats , in this regard ? i am not promoting any particular diet , just answering the question : dr wahls promotes a paleo diet. https : / / youtu.be / kljgblwh3wchave you watched this video , and read further into the research ? swank ’ s ms diet is actually a diet that has considerable merits , as far as the science and data . i doubt there is another diet out there that has measured up to his , regarding the results , research and such . and swank was fine with m.s. people eating some meat / poultry / fish-based paleo foods . it is the fats he drastically restricted , even plant-based fats.if there is any diet i ’ d ever suggest to anyone with ms , it is the swank diet , but one that focused on plants / fruits , no beans , no grains , no dairy , no eggs … … lots of plants and fruits . and i ’ d go even lower in fat that swank suggested.this is fantastic news ! thank you dr. g. let ’ s get the word out . any ideas on how we can get the annual ms150 ride from houston to austin to offer an i beat ms lunch break and rest stop snacks ? ? ? ? they are big on bbq here , it is ‘ ethnic food ’ .my esteem for dr. mcdougall just skyrocketed … i wonder why he was not already high in your esteem . john is close to be a hero for me . he stand and speak the truth since so long . all the credit for this study will go to dr swank as john requested. http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 1whn6dfzmwkthis is the same dr. mcdougall that claims vitamin d pills are harmful and should not be taken . i believe him . he also believes that mental illness , in some cases , are caused by gluten grains . both of these statements he has put in writing on his website . he is very clear about this feelings on both these issues.gluten grains ? i need to see the evidence before i get on board with that one.that ’ s not right . dr. mcdougall says only gluten is a problem for celiac patients and there is also wheat allergy for other people . the celiac is rare ( 1 % ) and a lot of people avoiding gluten ( the protein of wheat grain ) free now are drawn into it by industry promotion . rice , quinoa and many others are gluten free.this is one of my favorite volume 15 videos . i love when dr. greger presents such compelling data in the quantity of studies that he shares . i find it comparable to the rheumatoid arthritis video . the evidence against saturated fat and animal product consumption continues to pile up on the mountain. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / diet-rheumatoid-arthritis / toxins : i agree ! this video is simply awesome and so compelling.thanks for reminding us of the rheumatoid arthritis video too . anyone who hasn ’ t seen that one will want to take a look.i agree about the arthritis video . prior to watching it i was gluten , dairy , sugar and junk-free . that video convinced me that eating less animal protein wasn ’ t good enough to decrease inflammation – i had to stop it completely ! and that i did.yes i have personal experience with it as does my wife , arthritis is better without meat . we or rather she recognized it is an inflammatory process and became low fat vegan after seeing sanjay gupta ’ s report on bill clinton . a few relapses early on brought instant pain.danielfaster : another great comment . particularly telling was this part : ” a few relapses early on brought instant pain . ” that ’ s some serious bio-feedback . enough to convince anyone that they are on the right track ( when abstaining from animal products and high fat ) .veganrunner : thanks for this update ! i know that while some people go cold turkey , the rest of us follow a path to health , going step by step . i find it so interesting what event or information causes people to take the next step in eating healthier.that nutrition facts played a part in helping you take the next step is just so cool . it makes me proud to be part of the nutrition facts community.thanks thea . food is the best medicine ! i ’ d also like to hear if there would be a difference between animal-based fats and plant-based in this regard ? namely , i eat an enormous amount of nuts ( pecans , almonds , walnuts ) which all have high levels of saturated fat . is that still bad when it comes to some of these chronic illnesses ? you ’ ve probably already gotten the answer to this but yes , go easy on the nuts and seeds . too much fat , even if it is healthy , causes problems . see dr. esselstyn ’ s yell out to audience , “ no oil ! ” , this also implicates excessive intake of nuts and seeds and avocados.great story , i would like to ask the same question as elsie . can we eat plant based saturated fats like coconut oil ? dr. greger does not recommend consuming coconut oil http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-coconut-oil-clog-arteries / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-coconut-oil-cure-alzheimers / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-coconut-oil-good-for-you / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 07 / 30 / is-coconut-oil-good-for-you / and i can tell you anecdotally that my own symptoms are made worse by coconut oil , as well as very much in the way of chocolate.i ’ d like to add that dr. jelinek advocates an even lower-saturated fat diet than did swank , and those fewer grams of saturated fat make a difference for me.vickey : i wanted to thank you for taking the time to share your personal experiences . while anecdotal evidence is not science , it sure is helpful in making the science real for people . i ’ m sure that your comments will be helpful to people in similar circumstances . thanks.if dr. swank ’ s leaky gut theory of why saturated fats cause ms is true , then coconut oil is problematic . a study this year , demonstrated that n-3 fatty acids ( like those in flax ) reduce endotoxin transport from the gut by 50 % , olive and most vegetable oils had no effect , but coconut oil increased transport by 60 % .so , are endotoxins in particular ( the lipopolysaccharide cell walls of gram-negative bacteria , found both in food and in gut microbiomes ) , responsible for ms ? well , as far as i can tell ms is a multifactorial disease , but one can find plenty of articles demonstrating that lps receptors and inflammatory cytokine cascades , like those brought about by lps , play a role , at least in animal models.any research on chondrocalcinosis and diet ? is this also autoimmune ? when i had a knee x-ray due to an injury i was diagnosed with this . i ’ ve been low-fat vegan , ( esselstyn ) for the last 4 years , but ate sad before that . sallyvery interesting . lets turn it around . are there any studies suggesting that saturated fat and animal product consumption improves any inflammatory condition ( ms , bowel , rheumatoid arthritis ) or any type of cancer ? the only things i ’ ve seen are the coconut oil for alzheimer ’ s which only appears to be a mild transient delay of progression ( addressed by an nf video already ) and didn ’ t make it for long term studies ; and the conjugated linoleic ( linolenic ? ) acid from beef fat ( cla are the trans fats from beef ) which appear in some studies as a supplement to have a very mild positive effect on cardiovascular health in some people ( nf video says transfats from animal sources must be bad but does not address the cla claims ) . it may also not be that bad if you are treating starvation and there ’ s nothing else to eat ( you can always devise a study to show something has a benefit under special circumstances or is harmful under special circumstances ) . but you are right you can ’ t find any breakthroughs to treat and reverse heart disease or cancer or anything else with unhealthy food as a medicine.ms is a horrible , horrible disease . much of my first three decades were spent aiding my mother in caring for my grandmother ( who had primary progressive ms ) . in my earliest memories , my grandmother was on crutches , but for her last decade , we learned to interpret whether she wanted water , a trip to the bathroom , analgesic , or anxiolytic by the way her eyes rolled . my mother tried some ineffective complementary interventions ( i recall accupuncture ) , but at no point do i recall a neurologist mentioning a low fat diet . cream cheese and kielbasa sausage were normal fare.dr. mcdougall has gives a presentation on diet and ms to his study weekend participants , and there notes he won ’ t appear in the author list of the forthcoming paper . i suspect dr. bourdette , who wrote dr. swanks obituary in neurology , now holds dr. swank ’ s chair , and has continued his work , will have that honor.darryl : i ’ m sorry to hear about your grandmother.while i did not have such a prolonged or close experience , i did have a friend who came down with ms when we were both in our early thirties come . it hit her pretty hard , pretty fast and she died about a year later . i saw how awful it was for her near the end when she couldn ’ t even scratch her own head . i would bet she wasn ’ t told about diet changes.i saw dr. mcdougall this last weekend at a nutrition conference near where i live . he mentioned his ms research and that it would be published soon , but he didn ’ t give any details . i ’ m excited to hear what happened in this latest study.wow how one doctor can fix soo many things is just mind bogaling .proof after proof of how our own goverment has put all of ask risk when the real cure for most disease is cured or controled thru diet .. and the food chains feed us poison and nobody does anything about it … .. if it wasnt for the internet or library ’ s .our own goverment could keep killing us and we wouldnt be the wiser … i am ashamed at what this country has become … i just looked at the details of the swank diet ( on this page : http : / / www.swankmsdiet.org / about % 20the % 20diet ) and it ’ s not a vegan or even vegetarian diet . whether you consider it “ plant-based ” is debatable.it recommends two servings of ( nonfat or 1 % ) dairy and a teaspoon of cod liver oil every day , and allows unlimited white fish and shellfish , 1-3 ounces of fatty fish , and 4 ounces of skinned poultry daily , as well as 3 eggs a week . after the first year it also allows 2-3 ounces of red meat each week as long as the meat is not too high fat.nor does it seem that low-fat . it allows up to 65g of fat a day . on a 1750 calorie a day diet ( typical for a sedentary woman ) that ’ s 33 % of calories from fat a day . not super higher fat but not what i think of when i think of “ low fat ” diet either.surprisingly , the diet only recommends two servings of fruit and two cups of vegetables a day ! it also restricts all processed foods containing fat , saying “ no processed foods containing saturated fat . ” and “ commercially-prepared pastry usually contains shortening , butter , margarine and / or processed oil . therefore , you should avoid these foods . ” it explicitly forbids hydrogenated oils and margarines . it encourages whole grains over refined grains . so it ’ s clearly changing a number of aspects of people ’ s diets , and probably has the result that people end up eating at home and doing more from-scratch cooking . all good things , but there ’ s much more going on here than a “ low-fat plant-based diet . ” are you sure that ’ s the original “ swank diet ” or is it a modern super watered down version ? i remember dr. mcdougall saying how the pritikin diet was slowly watered down over the years and is now a much more moderate version of what nathan pritikin taught.yeah , from what i can tell it is swank ’ s original diet . the criticism on mcdougall ’ s webpage of the “ swank diet ” seems to correspond to the diet on the website i looked at . scroll down to the part titled “ the swank vs. the mcdougall diet ” on this page : http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / misc / 2009nl / jan / ms.htmit says “ the swank diet focuses on drastically reducing saturated fats , which are abundant in red meats and high-fat dairy products . included in his diet are low-fat dairy foods ( skim milk , fat-free cheese , fat-free ice cream , etc . ) , egg whites , skinned white-meat chicken , white fish and shellfish . meats with significant amounts of saturated fats are allowed only in very small amounts . dr. swank also included additional vegetable and fish oils in his diet . ” alma , this is very interesting . thank you for posting the link . i wonder if the current swank protocol is the protocol swank used in the studies dr. greger sourced . if so ( and why wouldn ’ t it be ) swank was not suggesting a vegan diet to cure / help ms. low fat , and absence of certain types of fats , yes.great video ! here i found the food do not allowed by the mcdougall program ( i don ’ t know if it is the only program ) … http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / free-mcdougall-program / steps-to-recovery / foods-not-allowed / i think is very similar to a plant based diet … other users more expert than me could give a feed back about this ? dr. mcdougall offers , in my opinion , the best program . it is based on science and is extremely satiating and practical . not to mention there is an incredible forum section with jeff novick to answer any question you may have.this is awesome … if i remember correctly one of my friend when i was studying physics suffer from this pathology and she was really young , so i will try to find her email in my old contacts … i think this information could really help … thanks toxins for the reply ! ! my niece has primary progressive ms which accounts for maybe 10 % of ms patients . any known results among that population ? wouldn ’ t you be mad if you had ms and your doctors never shared this info with you ? you are absolutely correct . i ’ ve had ms since ’ 99 . the only doctor , out of the millions i have ever seen or known , who has ever talked to me about ms and diet , is my own step-father . he is a psychiatrist . i started the swank diet in 2001 , except i decided to go totally vegetarian right away . i have not had a relapse since 2002 ! i began the mcdougall diet a few years ago and went totally vegan from there . dairy is a hard thing for a wi girl to give up ! when i presented the results from this most recent study to my neurologist last week , she still looked at me like i was a rare bird or something . it is hard to find doctors who take more into consideration than drug therapy , especially where i live . i make an annual long trip to see a “ more ” open neurologist who is located six hours from me once a year . i hope to be able to attend a mcdougall ten day program some day . for now , i will have to continue to rely on the live video feeds he has available for his advanced study weekends . the state of “ modern ” medicine and medical training infuriates me . i absolutely believe the stable status of my disease is due to drs. swank and mcdougall ! thanks for sharing . best wishes for more success.why are the most recent comments at the bottom ? recent comments should be at the top like youtube . but , hey , why do it the popular and familiar way ? : ) you can organize it by “ newest ” oldest ” and “ best ” . its based on your settings.awesome and thank you ! okay , i have a serious question . we know that if a person consumes too many carbohydrates , the human body has an ability to convert some of those excess carbs into fat . but not just any old fat . it converts them into saturated fat.so our bodies thrive on glucose … but saturated fat is problematic and detrimental . scientists also try to explain that this ability to generate and store saturated fat evolved to get us through times of famine . huh ? we evolved a means of generating and storing copious amounts of the most harmful fat to help us survive in the long term ? this is the absurd paradox science seems to be telling us.dr. greger , will you please resolve this ? we store the fat from excess carbohydrates as triglycerides although saturated fat serves certain structural needs . the point being we make enough saturated fat so we have no dietary need to consume any more.from the national academy of science : “ saturated fatty acids are synthesized by the body to provide an adequate level needed for their physiological and structural functions ; they have no known role in preventing chronic diseases . therefore , neither an ai nor rda is set for saturated fatty acids . there is a positive linear trend between total saturated fatty acid intake and total and low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol concentration and increased risk of coronary heart disease ( chd ) . a ul is not set for saturated fatty acids because any incremental increase in saturated fatty acid intake increases chd risk ” http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 10490 & page = 422also , i know of no information suggesting our body struggles to conserve excess macronutrients as fat . this is not a problem regardless when you are eating whole , minimally processed plant foods when your hungry till your full.thanks toxins , you said : “ i know of no information suggesting our body struggles to conserve excess macronutrients as fat . ” i was inquiring about converting carbohydrates , not conserving macronutrients.the message i ’ m getting from science is this : saturated fats are bad for us and we evolved the ability to generate and store them to help us survive.that is a logical absurdity . i honestly can ’ t blame low-carbers and paleo dieters when science presents this kind of mixed message . it is the saturated fat paradox.let me clarify what a macronutrient is . a macronutrient is protein , fat , or carbohydrates . too much of either , and it will be stored in the form of triglycerides . rarely , unless there is a medical condition , will we ever urinate out glucose . our kidneys are very good at conserving glucose.the message from the nutritional community is that excess saturated fat does not promote health . there is a difference between consuming saturated fat and our body creating all that it needs.how could someone possibly downvote this ? they are offended by recitation of biochemical and physiological facts ? would they downvote an anatomy phys textbook if they could ? people these days are reading blogs and drawing their own conclusions that contradict what the experts with decades in the field have to say , all the while not even having a handle on the basic vocabulary . sad in more ways than one.how could someone possibly downvote this ? because it did not answer the question . would they downvote a textbook ? if the textbook is wrong i would hope so . are you suggesting textbooks are always correct ? are you suggesting blogs are always wrong and scientists are always right ? how about we stick to the question at hand and set aside the tangential ( and irrelevant ) cheering and jeering ? lol , low carb troll , who else.a paradox ? your body requires something , so your body produces it . because your body produces it , you don ’ t need to consume it . because you don ’ t need to consume it , eating what are relatively huge excess quantities of it causes problems . where is the paradox again ? your body requires something , so your body produces it … therefore it is not bad for you . is vitamin c bad for animals that produce their own ? what about amino acids ? please give one other example in nature where an animal produces their own nutritional factor that is bad for them if they consume it ? your intuition makes sense . but nutritionally almost anything in excess has been shown to not be beneficial to long term health . multivitamins and nutritional supplements are a good example . no long term benefits.hi duke it does seem confusing at first , doesn ’ t it ? ! … however , in looking closely at the articles you mention , it becomes a little a clearer … the first study you mention included just 16 people total and did not include a non-treated ( control group ) for the duration of the study , so difficult to assess if any conclusion would be statistically meaningful ( or useful ) . additionally , ms can produce many symptoms : muscle weakness / spasm , fatigue , memory problems , bowel and bladder incontinence , and more . this study ( which may or may not be useful given the above-mentioned limitations ) only speculates that beta-interferon helps with the memory issues … it is not felt to help with symptoms of weakness , fatigue , incontinence , etc.the second study states that it was funded by pharmaceutical companies and that the physician-authors are also funded by pharmaceutical companies . the last line reads “ the study was funded by bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals . dr. ebers reports that he has financial relationships with roche , ucb , and bayer-schering . dr. gooding discloses that he has financial relationships with novartis , bayer-schering , teva , and emd serono . dr. weinstock-guttman discloses that she has financial associations with biogen idec , teva neuroscience , emd serono , pfizer , accorda , novartis , aspreva , and cognition . ” for more about research design and conflicts of interest , please check out dr. greger ’ s piece on study funding : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / arent-studies-funded-by-corporations-bias / thank you , here is the response : i agree with a lot of stuff in the article you sent , especially the de-stressing obviously … and the healthy diet and exercise.their credibility got hurt when they did not mention that the geographical relationship is mostly based on how far you grew up from the equator during your adolescent before 15 years old years . the research points to a strong relationship with vitamin d from the sun.and the fact that they are biased toward the swank diet , just like they accuse the doctors of bias toward the drugs . everyone has biases . there are many other studies supporting the beta interferon links , especially the ones that has to be done to get avonex approved . there is no sense them cutting it down , it has been proved to work … . that does not say that plant based diets from birth might be preventative also.they would be more creditable if they did not try to prevent their case so one-sidedly … .that really hurts their credibility.geographic distributionthere is a very specific geographic distribution of this disease around the world . a significantly higher incidence of the disease is found in the northernmost latitudes of the northern and the southern hemispheres compared to southernmost latitudes . this observation is based on the incidence of the disease in scandinavia , northern united states and canada , as well as australia and new zealand . the data from migration studies shows that if the exposure to a higher risk environment occurs during adolescence ( before 15 years of age , ) the migrant assumes the higher risk of the environment . this concept is nicely illustrated in studies of native-born south african white population with low incidence of the disease versus high incidence of ms among white immigrants from great britain , where the disease is much more prevalent ( saud a. sadiq , james r. miller et al . ) “ epidemics ” of ms have been reported and these provide further evidence of importance of environmental factors in ms. the most notable “ epidemic ” was described on the faroe islands after they were occupied by british troops in w.w.ii. similar increases in incidence of the disease were seen on shetland and orkney islands , in iceland , and in sardinia . a specific “ point agent ” for these “ epidemics ” never was identified.many experts , on the basis of epidemiological data showing less ms where there is more sun , animal work on improving experimental auto-immune encephalomyelitis with light therapy , reduced risk of ms with adequate sunlight or vitamin d supplementation and limited human studies , believe that sunlight improves ms. the evidence is convincing . people with ms can feel comfortable that sunlight is likely to improve their outcome from the disease , and protect them from many others in addition . provided the amount of uv radiation is not excessive , this is a very safe therapy . in winter , in most places in the world , a vitamin d supplement is necessary to keep vitamin d levels optimal at above150nmol / l ( 60ng / ml for those in the us ) . regarding vitamin d and multiple sclerosis , research suggests strongly that high-normal levels are required , so some people with ms aim even higher , perhaps at 200nmol / l. in my view , this will soon become accepted medical practice in the treatment of ms. the medical community is rapidly coming to an acceptance of the importance of adequate vitamin d levels for good health.and even avonex ’ s site , active source , http : / / www.msactivesource.com / ms-diet-and-exercise.xml ? utm _ campaign = health % 2520and % 2520wellness & utm _ source = google & utm _ medium = cpc & utm _ content = diet % 2520 % 2526 % 2520nutrition & utm _ term = ms % 2520and % 2520diet says medication is only part of the answer , diet and exercise are important . so the folks pushing the swank diet are trying too hard in my opinion.i started reading and studying the swank diet when i was first diagnosed with secondary progressive ms in 2006 . at that point , i was grossly overweight and got to the point of using a cane / walker to get around . i have been following the swank diet all these years . not only have i lost over 120 lbs but i am now running . i just finished running my first 1 / 2 marathon ! does nutrition make a difference – yes ! ! ! ! omgosh , you could be the poster child pjohns ! i ’ m so proud of dr mcdougall for creating the new ms study , it is doctors like him that do the work that the snob nosed ‘ reject anything the boys at the club ’ would not approve , and in doing so safe lives . he did it and will go down in history as a leader.there is no excuse anymore for people to get these diseases , if they have a computer and can type ‘ google ’ then they have no excuse , and i have no pity for them . thank you dr greger for putting this information up with the scientific proof to back it up ! update from a mcdougall admin : “ soon ” has now turned into an april 2014 release date for the oregon study . they keep pushing back the release date so i wouldn ’ t be surprised if we don ’ t see results until late 2014.dr. yadav , who is one of the co-investigators for the oregon study , presented some of the results of the one year study at the mcdougall advanced study weekend in september . the results in compliance and non ms parameters were very impressive . she did not present the ms results . dr. bourdette had spoken previously at another mcdougall advanced study weekend at the beginning of the study . he mentioned that given the number of participants , the length of the study and the nature of ms it would be unlikely to show significance . he was hoping that this study will lead to larger studies . dr. yadav mentioned that dr. bourdette will be presenting results in april at a national convention . the jury may still be out but two things are clear … one there is no downside to the prescribed diet and two if you have ms you certainly don ’ t want to add another chronic disease such as diabetes , arterial disease or obesity to the ms diagnosis . given the nature of the disease and the efficacy of the drug therapy i believe it is prudent to recommend the mcdougall diet for patients with ms.dr. john a. mcdougall was once my neighbor who lived about 2 blocks away from where i lived in maunawili , which is on the windward side ( southeastern area ) of the island of oahu.dr. mcdougall advocates plenty of solar exposure , which i feel is very unwise because of the permanent damage to our skin and eyes . the healthiest way to get the vitamin d that we need is from supplements , mushrooms , fish , and / or only a very limited amount of solar exposure.in the 1980s and 1990s , dr. mcdougall was severely criticized by many nutritionists for advocating zero calcium supplementation . at the other extreme , the national osteoporosis foundation encourages everyone to become obsessed with calcium supplementation and memorize the calcium content of various foods . both extremes are wrong . the optimal dosage of calcium supplementation is 300mg to 600mg per day of calcium carbonate . calcium carbonate is superior to all other forms of calcium supplementation because it strongly lowers our risk of developing colorectal cancer by binding with up to 70 % of the total heme iron in our intestines . like copper , manganese , and aluminum , iron is a pro-oxidant which , if consumed in excess , will damage every cell in our bodies and increase our risk of developing numerous killer diseases . all other forms of calcium supplementation can bind with only 10 % to 20 % of the total heme iron in our intestines.at a dosage of 300mg of calcium carbonate daily , we would derive about 90 % of the maximum benefit to our bone health and suffer 0 % of the maximum damage to our arteries . at a dosage of 600mg of calcium carbonate daily , we would derive 100 % of the maximum benefit to our bone health and suffer about 10 % of the maximum damage to our arteries.if blood calcium levels are low and need to be increased , the smart way to accomplish this is by eating shiitake mushrooms and not by swallowing forms of calcium supplementation that are different from calcium carbonate . shiitake mushrooms contain vitamins d1 , d2 , and d4 . vitamin d4 has health benefits that vitamin d1 , d2 , and d3 lack . some medical doctors prescribe vitamin d4 pills to increase blood calcium levels in patients with low blood calcium levels.about half of all people who suffer from heart disease have calcified arteries when examined by chest x-ray . the statin drugs that medical doctors prescribe will greatly improve our cholesterol numbers but will also make our calcified arteries much worse . the delicious , fermented , whole soybean food from japan called , natto , will remove the calcium from our arteries and put that calcium in our bones where it will prevent future bone fractures . no other food and no prescription medicine can reverse arterial calcification : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / john _ a. _ mcdougallronald , you wrote “ like copper , manganese , and aluminum , iron is a pro-oxidant which , if consumed in excess , will damage every cell in our bodies and increase our risk of developing numerous killer diseases . ” what about vegan foods that contain a lot of manganese and copper ? rye bread and some beans and certain nuts and seeds , multiple times per day , can send these metal levels well above the 100 % rda . i find manganese is easy to surpass 200-300 % , depending on the foods and quantity . and iron as well in beans . are these plant-based metals you have mentioned what you are referring to , or are you speaking specifically about meat-based forms ? also , thanks for the natto information . i had no idea.update from dr. yadav : the abstract has been submitted . they should know by the end of jan 2014 if it will be accepted . they think they may be able to release results by april 2014.update from dr. yadov : results will be presented at the american academy of neurology ’ s annual meeting in philly on may 1 , 2014.has the study about low fat diet and ms with patients that could received mri by dr mcdougall and yourself been completed ? if so , are the results published and available for consultation ? the huge question is why the ms society doesn ’ t promote the swank diet . if a drug could freeze ms in its tracks in 95 % of cases , some company would make billions . i assume that they don ’ t believe the data that dr. swank published.i firmly believe this ! ! plant based diet it is ! ! so where is the published study ? the “ randomized control trialed ” results that dr. mcdougal mentions will be out “ in the next year ” ? if the study report was completed in 2012 … any word if the results were as predicted ? just published a week ago ( as a poster abstract ) . it was disappointing : yadav , v. , marracci , g. , kim , e. , spain , r. , cameron , m. , overs , s. , … & bourdette , d. ( 2014 ) . effects of a low fat plant based diet in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) : results of a 1-year long randomized controlled ( rc ) study ( p6 . 152 ) . neurology , 82 ( 10 supplement ) , p6-152.after baseline difference adjustment , the groups showed no significant changes in the number of active lesions ( 0.4 , 95 % ci -1.2 to1.9 , p = 0.6 ) or other mr parameters , relapse rate , disability expanded disability status score , timed 25-foot walk and fatigue severity score.i was waiting for this study to come out ! so “ no significant changes in the number of active lesions ” do not mean that there desease are undercontrol and no longer progress ? no significant changes between the experimental and control groups . basically , the variation of disease progression was big in both groups before the study , and any benefit was small and overwhelmed between the groups , statistically , by this individual variation.if saturated free fatty acids are directly mediating inflammation in ms , perhaps its more difficult to achieve swank ’ s results in the short term in modern , more overweight populations ( those fats get released upon weight loss ) . swank ’ s studies were also done in the pre-mri era , so perhaps were more prone to selective recall by patients . most importantly , perhaps , was the limited 1 year duration of the experiment ; some forms of ms progress by fits and spurts , and swank ’ s results may have required inhibiting several of these before a measurable benefit was seen.i see , thanks for precising things . so we can ’ t see any difference at least for one years on overweight people . i hope they will do a follow up .. i send you a message on fb by the way , if you might look at it . thanks again.i visit fb once every few months , if at all . i found your message and responded.thanks : ) just found out about dr.swank. i have multiple sclerosis and can barely walk with a walker anymore.i ’ m at a terrible point with this disease . could you please tell me what the name of the book is by dr.swank that focuses on multiple sclerosis ? thank you.hi kat , sorry to hear you are dealing with ms. check out the swank foundation website : http : / / www.swankmsdiet.org / .ldn ( low dose naltrexone ) has been found to stop the progression of ms in about 85 % of patients. http : / / www.ldninfo.org it is fda approved at 50mg , but used in a low dose of 1.5 – 4.5 mg / day . it is inexpensive , no side effects except some sleeplessness the first week or so in some people , and is used by thousands with success . join the yahoo ldn group mentioned on the ldn link above and ask any of the over 11,000 people there who use ldn any questions you may have . another supplement that can have astoundingly positive results for ms is lion ’ s mane mushroon . best wishes.dr. greger , an even more interesting fact looking at the map is why is the southern hemisphere completely void of ms ? the swank diet appears to include meat , eggs and dairy . it is not a vegan diet . to really benefit one needs to go vegan plus and eat a diet of whole organic plants while avoiding salt , sugar and refined carbohydrates.this have a lot of merits . my take . in the usa a lot of folks with ms have indian descent whether known or not . the indian couldn ’ t eat the sad . interesting enough , the indian diet , exercise and magnesium therapy , can have people living ms symptom free . my wife has had it since 1995 and the liaisons have been basically in the same place for the past 14 yearsi ’ m trying to gain info about erythromelalgia — aka red feet — and diet . tea website is not wildly helpful . any studies on that ? hi , if we limit the intake of saturated fats to 15g max , how much good fats are we allowed to consume on top of the 15g ? thanks , we recently had a family member diagnosed and would like to know more about this diet.after not seeing a follow up video , i read the results of the diet & multiple sclerosis study ( https : / / www.drmcdougall.com / 2014 / 07 / 31 / results-of-the-diet-multiple-sclerosis-study / ) and the results were not promising . sure , patients lost weight and experienced improved lipid profiles — but the extent of their improvement was that they felt “ better ” . mri images showed no differences between the diet and control groups , and there was no difference in disability or relapses between the groups as well.do you have any commentary or insight to these results , dr. greger ? dr. mcdougall himself stated why the results were not unexpected . the study was too small and there was an inherent bias based on the health and severity of the disease in the two groups.until february 2015 the study results were still not posted here : https : / / clinicaltrials.gov / ct2 / show / results / nct00852722keep us posted if it becomes published or if you find related studies on diet and ms. “ the diet group consisted of much sicker patients than the control group . ” hi mark . that link doesn ’ t appear available can you repost it ? i think even if what you state is true , even if they felt better isn ’ t that reason enough to try a healthier diet ? the fact we have so much research on diet and ms is promising for patients who are trying to deal with the symptoms of the disease . sometimes anything is better than nothing , especially if one could reduce the progression of ms. the idea of the video and research is to build awareness about the connections between diet and ms. if you find more research please share with us , and i ’ ll do the same . hope that ’ s alright : - ) low fat diet and multiple sclerosis study has been completed but no study results were posted , february 2015 : https : / / clinicaltrials.gov / ct2 / show / study / nct00852722low fat diet and multiple sclerosis study has been completed but no results were posted on clinicaltrials february 2015 : https : / / clinicaltrials.gov / ct2 / show / results / nct00852722please let us know when it ’ s available ! thanks.i have been investigating protocols which help ms , for a friend . nutrition is obviously ver beneficial , ( swanks , jelinek , yourself ) . so are large doses vitamin d3 ( dr cicero coimbra , brazil ) . ( https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = hofo29rl-gi ) in case you are interested . ( has english subtitles ) . i wondered why both seem to benefit ms sufferers , ( and others ) .i read somewhere that certain foods prevent the processing of vitamin d.they mentioned the usual suspects , sat fat , animal protein , not enough fibre etc , and suggested that it was because all these things raised cortisol levels which then prevents vit d working , ( perhaps in people who have a genetic problem with vitamin d ) . have you come across evidence to suggest this ? the diseases linked to low vit d seem to also be linked to poor ( as in not whole food , plant based ) diet , so presumaby there is a connection . i would be really interested in any research on this . thanks again , anne jamiesonhi anne , thanks for reposting your question . there are studies that focus on the role of vitamin d in multiple sclerosis and this review may explain more . vitamin d acts like an immune modulator . it serves so many important roles in the body . the vitamin is more like a hormone . some research suggests ms patients cannot properly maintain vitamin d levels , and may experience certain changes in their dna that negativity affect vitamin d receptors.drinking too much milk ( or having a high calcium intake ) seems to increase prostate cancer risk . one theory behind this is because high loads of calcium can down-regulate the parathyroid hormone , which is responsible for producing active vitamin d in the kidneys , therefore increasing prostate cancer risk . we know vitamin d is very important for immunity and health so it ’ s important to assure we get outside and soak up the sun ! here are dr. greger ’ s optimal nutrition recommendations , if interested.thanks for your questions ! let me know is this helps . josephsir plz tell us about systemic sclerosis ? ’ when do you expect the results of the study ? or did it turn out to be inconclusive ? hello everyone . i never post anything online , but i noticed this on the site and felt compelled . i have had this monster disease since i was nineteen and now am sixty-three . when i was first cripple , i was determined to overcome it . so , i started researching , without computers . i sent my teacher friends to the medical library and elsewhere to get books for me so that i could try to figure this out . my hands were both waving around like sea anemones so i had to turn pages with a gadget . ha well , as it turns out , i designed a diet very similar to dr. terry wahls and dr. george jelinek sp ? i looked at my behaviour at the time and decided that vitamin d played an integral role . that is why i added wild caught salmon oil , cod liver oil and the most nutrient dense vegetables that i could get . also , i rotated between calves liver and wild caught salmon and tuna . i have not had any changes on mri since 2003 which could be some proof . i also insure that i have gut bacteria replenished every single time that i take an antibiotic using kefir and those expensive probiotics that are refrigerated . i was allergic to milk as a child . i also had the worse case of measles known to mankind . i seldom eat any other kind of meat because liver is the most nutrient dense substance that i could find when i was designing the diet . i do not like it . it gets bigger in my mouth as i chew it , but it seems to give me instant energy . that is the only reason that i put it in the diet . i try to get 20 minutes of sun at noon because of where i live . if i can ’ t get out or i get msy , i take a supplement 5000-10,000 daily . you must have several other vitamins for it to work because it is synergistic with them . ( magnesium , k2 ) this wonderful doctor on this site could tell you , of course . i think that one day they will identify a type of gut bacteria that the body reacts to combined with low vitamin d levels . my first cousin has ms also so there must be a genetic component . i hope that this helps someone ! my mom ’ s prayers are very effective . cheers ! ! i am still walking … and playing guitar.in a small percentage of ms cases ( maybe as high as 7 % ) there is a vitamin b12 deficiency present . your positive experience with liver , a rich source of b12 , suggest b12 might be worth a try . i would look into methylcobalamin shots ( 1000-15000 mcg ) or at least high oral doses ( 5000-30000 mcg ) . after the first 30 micrograms the rest is passively absorbed at about 1-2 percent of oral intake . see the book : < > by s. pacholokthis low fat diet works for ms according to dr. stephen fry because the protomyxzoa ( parasite ) that feeds on the myelin needs fat to grow . when we cut the fat out , these parasites die back . it ’ s very interesting research ! http : / / protomyxzoa.org / acute myeloid leukemia , africa , aging , angiogram , animal fat , animal products , asia , autoimmune diseases , beef , bladder disease , bladder health , brain disease , brain health , cardiovascular health , chemotherapy , chicken , cholesterol , cognition , dairy , dr. caldwell esselstyn , dr. dean ornish , dr. john mcdougall , dr. roy swank , eggs , europe , eye disease , eye health , fat , fatigue , heart disease , heart health , inflammation , ldl cholesterol , leukemia , low-fat diets , meat , medications , milk , mortality , multiple sclerosis , nerve health , norway , pain , plant-based diets , pork , poultry , pritikin , saturated fat , sausage , side effects , surgery , tremors , turkey , vegans , vegetarians , vision , weakness a plant-based diet may not only be the safest treatment for multiple sclerosis , it may also be the most effective . i touched on this in my live 2013 year-in-review lecture more than an apple a day , but i ’ m excited to be able to take a deeper dive into this extraordinary story.those interested in supporting dr. mcdougall ’ s landmark study ( headed by dr. dennis bourdette , m.d. and under the supervision of dr. vijayshree yadav ) can donate to his nonprofit mcdougall research & education foundation ( you can also donate to nutritionfacts.org to help keep us bringing you similarly underreported yet life-saving science by clicking on the donate button above ) .another reason dr. swank ’ s work hasn ’ t been embraced may be the tomato effect.other videos on the role diet may play in neurological disorders include : what ’ s in sausage and eggs that may cause so much inflammation ? see my video series on endotoxins described in my blog how does meat cause inflammation ? where is saturated fat found ? see trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero.those unfamiliar with pritikin can watch a short introduction in engineering a cure , and ornish and esselstyn ’ s great work is profiled in videos like our number one killer can be stopped and china study on sudden cardiac death.for more context check out my blog : top 10 most popular videos from 2013 and how to treat multiple sclerosis with diet .
PLAIN-2709	tricks to get kids to eat healthier at school what happens if you give one group of kids a plate of cookies and the other group the same number of cookies , but cut in half , and tell both groups they can eat as many as they want ? researchers reported that decreasing cookie size led to 25 % fewer cookie calories eaten.the goal of this study was to help counter obesity-promoting eating behaviors facilitated by the availability of large portions of junk food , and the findings suggest that reducing the size of cookies ( without altering the total amount of food ) decreases children ’ s short-term caloric intake , a ‘ ‘ dietary strategy ’ ’ for guardians to discreetly decrease unhealthy behaviors . but do you know what 's in these things ? partially hydrogenated oil , trans fats . no one should be eating those . in fact , i can think of another " dietary strategy " to decrease kid 's intake - don 't give them any.admittedly , this is easier said than done . even in the ‘ granola crunchy ’ san francisco bay area , when parents and school administrators proposed to ban junk food it sent a faction of teachers into an apoplectic fit.in texas , there was such parental outrage , they got lawmakers to pass a safe cupcake amendment . the amendment , known as lauren 's law , ensures that parents and grandparents of schoolchildren celebrating a birthday can bring whatever the heck they want to school.fine. what if you just offered fruit in addition to the cupcakes at classroom celebrations ? to observe student response to the addition of fresh fruit , bowls of fresh , cut-up fruit provided by the researchers were added to the party food brought by the parents at half of the 4 kindergarten or preschool celebrations . no special effort was made to encourage students to choose the fruit : they just put it out there . would kids actually eat fruit when there was birthday cake , ice cream , and cheese puffs taking up nearly a whopping third of their daily caloric intake ? yes ! on average each kid at a full fruit serving . take that , cheesy puffs ! there are entire curricula available now for schools , such as veggiecation , where for a whole year classrooms feature a new “ veggie of the month , ’ sprinkled with nutrition mantras like , ‘ ‘ fiber equals a happy tummy . ’ ’ and it works ! " the active engagement of students in tasting and rating of vegetable dishes seemed to have contributed to higher consumption of featured vegetables . ” one school was able in some cases to double vegetable consumption-just by giving them attractive names . elementary students ate twice the number of carrots if they were called “ x-ray vision carrots , ” compared to when they were ‘ just ’ carrots , or generically named as the “ food of the day . ” how about power punch broccoli , silly dilly green beans , or calling broccoli tiny tasty tree tops ? selection of broccoli increased by 109.4 % ; green beans by 177 % . conclusion : “ these studies demonstrate that using an attractive name to describe a healthy food in a cafeteria is robustly effective , persistent , and scalable with little or no money or experience . ” these names were not carefully crafted , discussed in focus groups , and then pre-tested . they just thought them up out of thin air . and kids were suckered into eating healthier for months by putting out silly little signs . in this school , vegetable intake was up nearly 100 % , while in the control school without signs , vegetable consumption started low and actually got worse . so why isn 't every single school in the country doing this right now ? ! bring it up at your next pta meeting.and if you want to get really bold , you can join the nutritious school lunch revolution led by pioneering organizations like the new york coalition for healthy school food . when i was a child , we all loved to eat spinach because we saw popeye eat it during saturday morning cartoons . we wanted to be strong like popeyethanks for another practical video . the point is well taken and entirely appropriate . there is no nutritional value to food which is not eaten . getting kids to eat healthy can be especially problematic . any strategy which makes it easier to overcome the apparent barriers , on both an individual and social level is much appreciated.put joan cusack on it . the little ankle bitters will eat right , like it and clean up their rooms ! i like the idea with attractive names – what about non-attractive names : stroke-beef cancer-milk inflammation-egg mercury-fish diabetes-cheese coronary occlusion-poultry cavity-candy : - ) plantstrongdoc , thanks for the laugh ! great idea ! kind of along the lines of the “ horrors of smoking ” ads seen in recent years.plantstrongdoc : too funny ! my contributions include : * poop-crusted legs ( for chicken ) * puss milk ( or puss cheese – take your pick ) * die-early eggs * constipation steaki don ’ t know if it would make any difference given what many kids and their parents seem happy to eat , but it would be worth a shot . : - ) great vid ! this is really encouraging , but the news media are still reporting the backlash. http : / / news.msn.com / us / some-school-districts-dropping-healthier-lunch-programs . same story as the last year ’ s brouhaha from kansas as the usual fate of such efforts . see http : / / www.khi.org / news / 2012 / oct / 01 / some-say-new-meal-guidelines-should-be-scrapped / . sigh.dr.greger , why are you recommending that site when it recommends that 25 % of diet is animal food ? that ’ s a good point worth reflecting on . regardless , if the goal is healthy food , nutritionally educated people need to get involved and raise the bar so the food is actually healthy ( animal-free , as you imply ) .this is another fascinating video but what is your objection to using adverbs ? given the education context , it would have been appropriate to get the grammar right.prescriptive grammar is arbitrary . dr. gregor is trying to educate people , so he writes the way they talk . i don ’ t think it takes away from his professionalism . he seems to be trying to make these videos accessible to the average person . be honest , would you really say “ more healthily ” if you were talking to someone ? this isn ’ t an english exam . perfect grammar isn ’ t everyone ’ s top priority . the good and important thing is that health information is being shared , and people are being greatly helped by it . peaceit ’ s easier to get kids to eat fruit because kids have a sweet tooth . they don ’ t really crave candy , like lifesavers , they crave tart berries , sweet strawberries , tasty bananas , wonderful watermelon . they are drawn to candy because conventional , pesticide-grown fruit is bland . put organic ripe fruit on the table and kids will drop the artificial candy and devour nature ’ s candy . remember that lifesavers got its flavors from nature.as the study suggests , adding cool names to platters of ripe , organic fruit will increase eating even more.doing the cute names , making eating the food a game is just what the food companies do with their packaging & commercialsor the reason why mc donald calls the happy meal his product , which real name should be the unhealty meal , to be honest. abdominal fat , broccoli , cake , calories , carrots , cheese puffs , children , cookies , cupcakes , fat , fiber , fruit , green beans , hydrogenated fats , ice cream , junk food , new york coalition for healthy school food , obesity , oils , school lunch program , texas , trans fats , vegetables , veggiecation interventions to improve child nutrition at school have included everything from reducing cookie size , adding fruit to classroom cupcake celebrations , and giving vegetables attractive names , to more comprehensive strategies such as " veggiecation " curricula and transforming school cafeterias . what 's so bad about trans fats ?

PLAIN-2719	reducing muscle fatigue with citrus the same lactic acid that makes yogurt tangy is the same lactic acid that builds up in our muscles when we exercise strenuously . instead of bacteria fermenting the sugar in milk to make energy for themselves , our muscles ferment sugar in our diet to produce energy to contract . if , like when we 're sprinting , lactic acid builds up in our muscles faster than it can be removed we can end up with a burning sensation in our muscles , forcing us to stop.now , if we train , we can increase the number of blood vessels in our muscles and clear out the lactate faster . for example , if you take some " overweight sedentary women ” and start them on an aerobic training program of running and walking , at the end of three months their lactate levels during exercise dropped 17 % , but those on the same program who drank 2 cups of orange juice a day dropped their levels 27 % . they did the same exercise program , but the citrus group experienced a significant decrease in blood lactate concentration , indicating an improvement in physical performance with less muscle fatigue.i don 't recommend drinking juice , because you 're losing all that wonderful fiber that slows the rate of fruit sugar absorption into our system . here 's the blood sugar spike one might see after drinking coca-cola . compare that to the spike you see with orange juice . no difference . but what if you ate the same quantity of sugar in the form of orange slices ? so the whole fruit is nearly always better than fruit juice . now this is not to say oj isn 't better than coke . oj has those citrus phytonutrients like hesperidin , which may be why the women 's triglycerides didn 't go up even though they were drinking 2 cups of fruit juice every day . hesperidin may actually help lower our digestion of fats , but once you get up to 3 cups a day you really can start bumping your triglycerides . dr greger , speaking of triglyceride levels : if one has a genetic predisposition to low hdl levels and elevated triglyceride levels despite exercise , good overall cholesterol levels and the consumption of a plant based diet , is there anything that can be done to increase the hdl and lower the triglycerides ? is one eventually likely to have heart problems due to this continual elevation of triglyceride levels ? highly recommend reading “ the cholesterol myth ” by dr. stephen sinatra ( cardiologist ) to get bigger picture of cholesterol and heard disease connection . jbjb just curious . have you watched the videos under cholesterol and the role it plays in heart disease ? or the videos under heart disease ? why would you choose to believe dr sinatra and not all the current research presented here ? i believe both dr greger and dr sinatra have an issue with prescribing cholesterol lowering drugs although maybe for different reasons.i am not being flippant . i really want to know how someone makes the decision to follow a guy selling a book vs the overwhelming research suggesting something different.darryl ’ s posted article above on the tarahumaras is fascinating and i think highlights the importance of exercise in the equation along with a low fat diet . and of course they don ’ t eat junk . although they do eat this really high energy porridge i believe made from a root vegetable . very interesting group of people.a good narrative source on the modern tarahumara is chris mcdougall ’ s [ i ] born to run [ / i ] ( no relation to dr. john mcdougall ) . the traditional tarahumara diet is ( by calories ) 71 % corn and 19 % beans , about 75 % carbs ( 6 % of which being sugars ) , 13 % protein , and 12 % fat . coronary disease among these ultra-marathoners was unknown and their total cholesterol is a low ( by american standards ) 125 mg / dl , while their mean triglycerides of 120 mg / dl was slightly above ( the then ) mean american level of about 116 mg / dl.though the post you reply has been deleted ( it happens a lot on weekends ) , i thought i ’ d share a statement from the aha on triglycerides , which notes the difficulties with using their level as an independent cvd risk factor.i read that book . of course afterwards i had to try barefoot running.why do they get deleted ? that was very informative.worth noting the “ heart attack proof ” tarahumara of mexico have elevated triglycerides , triglycerides increased slightly in ornish ’ s landmark low-fat diet heart study , and those genetically predisposed to high triglycerides are not at elevated risk for atherosclerosis.this paper argues that the association of high triglycerides with coronary risk isn ’ t causal , but is instead a marker for metabolic syndrome ( diabetes etc ) which increases risk by other mechanisms.leg cramps at night . potassium , magnesium , calicum , hydration all check out okay . what else to check ? consider side effects of any medications that you are taking.try drinking more water.how about some body work ? stretching , yoga , or massage ? perhaps mind / body work might help , too . meditation , progressive relaxation ? dear brocca , a few years ago i had severe leg cramps at night , perhaps similar to those of yours . at that time i wasn ’ t a “ real ” vegan , but more of a “ bread-milk-coffee ” vegetarian , eating ( much ) too little vegetables , and ( much ) too much of my home-made whole-grain bread ( whole wheat , either alone or mixed up with rye ) , coffee with milk , and also some factory-made white bread , and butter and olive oil occasionally.although i cannot exactly remember all circumstances involved , i do remember that i some days were out walking a couple of miles . and i never did any stretching afterwards of any parts of my legs . so that could have been one causative factor.more likely , though , is an explanation based on something that i ate , or did not eat : so either it was a toxins issue ( most likely ) , or a vitamin / mineral deficiency issue.as for the toxins explanation , it could have been the coffee or the bread ( or both ) . perhaps the coffee and the grains had some pesticides or storage chemicals on them . this could be related also to the idea that i at this time had a very poor blood sugar management , and frequently woke up with cramps . this poor blood sugar management was probably ( partly ) an effect of that i did not eat any beans and lentils , and thus i did not get the “ lentil effect ” ( see dr. greger ’ s video “ beans and the second meal effect ” : nutritionfacts.org / video / beans-and-the-second-meal-effect ) .if one plays around with a deficiency type of explanation , one could note that i did not take any vitamin b12 or vitamin d at the time . so it could have been a vitamin b12 or / and vitamin d issue . it is interesting to note that some researchers link b12 deficiency with seizures ( kumar 2004 , “ recurrent seizures : an unusual manifestation of vitamin b12 deficiency ” , http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15069260 ) .it may also be interesting to note that i haven ’ t had any cramps since i started my “ serious ” vegan diet . so i have skipped all milk , coffee , tea , butter , and olive oil , and most bread . instead i now focus on green veggies and beans and lentils , and being very careful to always sprinkle some lemon or orange over the veggies and at the same meal also eat some fat ( whole nuts or avocado , not any oils ) . i think this has really helped to maximize the vitamin and mineral absorption from all the ( mostly cooked ) green veggies that i eat : kale , spinach , broccoli , cauliflower , cauliflower stalks and leaves , celery , dill , parsley , fennel , carrots , tomatoes , etc.as for other explanations for leg cramps , i came across on the web a person who reported that eating three brazil nuts every day for a month was the trigger ( http : / / www.peoplespharmacy.com / 2009 / 03 / 19 / brazil-nuts-beh ) . although it would be easy to simply say that it might have been the total amount of selenium that triggered it , or , perhaps , that it was the relative high dose of saturated fat that triggered it ( which one might compare with my own previous intake of saturated fat in milk ) , another , perhaps more realistic explanation , might be that there were some pesticide or some storage-chemical sprayed on the brazilnuts that was toxic to the nervous system.i forgot to explicitly state a before-and-after effect in my reply above , so here it is.previously when i was a bread-milk-coffee vegetarian i sometimes got leg cramps at night after having been out walking for miles . but nowadays , being a more strict mostly-green-veggies-and-beans vegan , i can be out walking for miles , even on hot days , and hardly drink anything at all ( not before , during , or after the walk ) , and not doing any stretching at all ( not before , during , or after the walk ) , and still not getting any leg cramps during the night ( or at any other time ) .so in my case it is seemingly not about dehydration , or stretching . i attribute my new state to the synergetic nutritional effect of all the different green vegetables and beans ( no soy ! ) and lentils that i am now eating , and to the vitamin b12 ( 1000 mcg / day ) and d3 ( 2000 ie = 50 mcg / day ) and iodine ( using dr. vogel ’ s herbamare vegan salt with kelp ) and selenium ( one brazilnut / day ) , and to the complete avoidance of coffee , milk / dairy products , and commercially produced breads.this is likely dehydration / electrolyte deficit . i bicycle about 100 miles per week average , and sometimes get leg cramps . what helps me is coconut water post ride on hot days . dr greger said that coconut water has been used as a blood volume expander directly into the blood stream . when i drink coco water the cramps stay away . 11 ounces , sometimes i mix with blended cranberries and mango for a post ride smoothie . it tastes awesome , and no cramps.i don ’ t know what brand coconut water you use , but be aware that vitacoco paid a $ 10 million settlement for , in part , knowingly overstating the electrolytic content of their product.what i know is that i don ’ t get cramps when i drink it , and do get cramps if i don ’ t ( on hot days ) . even if its a placebo effect , it works , and that ’ s what ’ s important for me . ; ) most of my patients with back pain have leg pain or cramps when lying down or walking , because straightening the back and the hips at the same time causes pain down the legs , due to various mechanisms . lying down with a pillow or two under the knees flexes the thighs slightly , so they have less pain . these patients also tend to have more back and leg symptoms when walking but not when bicycling , for the same reason . consult with your doc or a spine doc if this seems to describe you . andy , physical therapistmight need to consider having your veins checked . leg cramps at night can be a sign of poor circulation in your legs due to faulty vein valves – allowing blood flow back down and circle in your legs instead of moving up to the heart . this condition is called chronic venous insufficiency.another thing to think about is hypothyroidism . that can cause muscle cramps . i take synthroid for the condition , and if i don ’ t get enough ( and my tsh numbers go up ) i start getting vicious leg cramps from that.yes , leg cramps may have something to do with hypothyroidism . but it may also be connected to alcoholism , i.e. liver problems , as well as with kidney failure or some kidney condition ( see university of maryland medical center ’ s “ muscle cramps ” page at http : / / umm.edu / health / medical / ency / articles / muscle-cramps ) .my own theory is that these apparently different manifestations all are connected to vitamin d deficiency ( and potentially other factors as well ) . here are some observations : first , vitamin d deficiency is commonly linked to liver problems , for the liver may have problems hydroxylating the d2 or d3 to 25-hydroxyvitamin d ( which is needed by the kidneys to further convert it ) ; also , “ vitamin d functions intricately with parathyroid hormone ( pth ) to maintain plasma calcium and phosphate concentrations ” ( stokes et al . 2013 , http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1111 / liv.12106 / full ) .second , we know that a not fully functional kidney may result in a decline in the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d ( from 25-hydroxyvitamin d ) , and that this may be linked to hyperparathyroidism ( wisam al-badr and kevin j. martin 2008 , “ vitamin d and kidney disease ” , http : / / cjasn.asnjournals.org / content / 3 / 5 / 1555.full ) .third , since the parathyroid ( despite its name ) is not the immediate controller of the thyroid ( for the pituitary gland is ) , we are not surprised that some studies associate * increased * concentration of parathyroid hormone with hypothyroidism ( see bouillion and de moor 1980 , “ influence of thyroid function on the serum concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d3 ″ , http : / / jcem.endojournals.org / content / 51 / 4 / 793.abstract ? sid = 857effc0-28a4-4482-be4e-7dcc301210bf ) fourth , we are also not surprised to see that vitamin d apparently upregulates gene expression in the pituitary gland ( perez-fernandez et al . 1997 , “ vitamin d receptor gene expression in human pituitary gland ” , http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 8995530 ) . this might support the idea that vitamin d deficiency is one factor that may lead to hypothyroidism ; and perhaps low iodine levels are not as important as some think , in terms of being a factor behind hypothyroidism.so because my own leg cramps were not caused by any dehydration or by “ forgetting to stretch ” ( see my separate posts in this thread ) , it seems possible to suggest that my d3 supplementation has positively contributed to the elimination of my cramps ( which i nowadays don ’ t have at all ) , perhaps in combination with the extra supplements that i take : iodine ( kelp ) , b12 ( methylcobalamin ) , and selenium ( brazilnut ) .pasteurized over the counter oj makes me gassy , but freshly squeezed does not . any ideas ? placebo effect ? what about eating oranges ? any problems there ? i personally refuse to drink juice unless i blend whole oranges as a smoothie.i juice oranges , eat the pulp first , then drink the juice . same as eating whole oranges . i can down 20 oranges this way after a strenuous morning workout . then i rinse my mouth out with water and little baking soda to neutralize the acids.what about lemon , lime , or grapefruit ? can we assume these would help as well ? using a centrifugal type juicer will give you all parts of the orange … except the fiber which is needed , so not great . we need the fiber for proper digestion and use . using a food processor on the whole orange , some maple syrup , or whatever suits you , some great seasonings … cinnamon , allspice , nutmeg , or again … whatever suits you … gives you a great whole “ marmalade . ” pile on sweet potatoes … or again , whatever suits you and mmmmmm ! healthy and delicious . eating the whole fruit give us everything that is built into the orange including the bioflavanoids , which i think is found in the skin . enjoy ! try to use a non sprayed fruit or wash well.the sugar spike from citrus juice is concerning . i would also be concerned with the acid / tooth decay curve . i want to eat more citris fruit , especially with the benefit described in the video . on something maybe related , i ’ m working on aroma scents . the lavender video got me started . i bought several little bottles of food extracts — vanilla , mint , strawberry , cinnamon and so on . i gave a box full of them to my 85 year old mom to see if she could identify the scents . she did fair to midland , but her strongest hits were on lemon and orange and there was a happy face that went with it.the united states currently has the greatest number of known centenarians of any nation , with 53,364 according to the 2010 census , or 1.73 per 10,000 people . -wikipedia-how can this be if we are the largest consumers of meat and why are we going to china to do studies when we are the ones living longer.so would consuming an orange or drinking oj while performing an endurance event help reduce lactic acid build up ? last winter i spent some time in norway and i was surprised how insistent the norwegians were in taking tangerines with them on their cross country ski trips.they almost wouldn ’ t go without any . i couldn ’ t see why ( except that they ’ re tasty ) . now with the last two videos ( citrus might help against hypothermia and lactic acid build-up ) , it starts making a lot more sense : ) no biggie , however , lactic “ acid ” is not formed in the body . lactate in the plasma is simply a maker of glycogen utilization and not responsible for pain or fatigue . it does correlate / corresponds with pain and fatigue since the body at this point has an increased reliance on glycolytic , fatigable muscle fibers . it is not an acid at a physiological ph ( pka ~ 3.5 ) ; at high intensities muscle acidity is due to intracellular hydrogen ion formation within the cell due to higher levels of atp hydrolysis and nadh formation ( a high atp demand / o2 supply ratio ) . also , in some cases , higher levels of sns activity leading to vasoconstriction and anoxia in working muscles to maintain adequate central blood supply at maximal exercise intensities. athletes , blood sugar , body fat , citrus , coca-cola , dairy , exercise , fat , fatigue , fruit , grapefruit , hesperidin , lactic acid , lemons , limes , milk , muscle health , oranges , phytonutrients , sugar , triglycerides , yogurt daily citrus fruit consumption during athletic training may reduce muscle fatigue , as evidenced by lower blood lactate concentrations . the burning sensation during strenuous exercise may be related to the build-up of lactic acid in our muscles , but that 's different than the delayed onset muscle soreness that occurs in the days following a bout of extreme physical activity . that 's thought to be due to inflammation caused by muscle cell damage , little micro-tears in our muscles . if it 's an inflammatory reaction , than might anti-inflammatory phytonutrients help ? find out in the next video reducing muscle soreness with berries.more about what citrus phytonutrients can do in my last video keeping your hands warm with citrus.for more context check out my associated blog : how citrus might help keep your hands warm , citrus to reduce muscle fatigue , and berries to prevent muscle soreness .
PLAIN-2729	fighting the blues with greens ? why does frequent consumption vegetables appear to cut ones odds of depression by more than half ? and by more frequent they mean eating vegetables not 3 or more times a day , but just 3 or more times a week . but even that seemed to cut the odds of developing depression by 60 % after controlling for a long list of variables.in the 2012 study that found that eliminating animal products improved mood within 2 weeks . the researchers blamed arachidonic acid , primarily in chicken and eggs , which may adversely impact mental health via a cascade of brain inflammation , but better moods on plant-based diets could also be from the good stuff in plants , a class of phytonutrients that cross the blood brain barrier into our heads . this recent review in the journal nutritional neuroscience suggests that eating lots of fruits and vegetables " may present a noninvasive natural and inexpensive therapeutic means to support a healthy brain . yeah , but how ? well to understand the latest , we need to understand the underlying biology , the so-called monoamine theory of depression , the thought that depression may arise out of a chemical imbalance in the brain . here 's the oversimplified version : one of the ways the billions of nerves in our brain communicate with one another is through chemical signals called neurotransmitters . here 's the end of one nerve and the beginning of another.this is what it actually looks like under amicroscope . note the two nerve cells don 't actually touch — there 's a physical gap between them . to bridge that gap , when one nerve wants to tap the other on the shoulder it releases chemicals into that gap , including three monoamines , serotonin , dopamine and norepinephrine . these neurotransmitters then float over to the other nerve to get its attention . the first nerve then sucks them back in to be reused the next time it wants to talk , but it 's also constantly manufacturing more and an enzyme , monoamine oxidase , is constantly chewing them up to maintain just the right amount.the way cocaine works is by acting as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor . it blocks the first nerve from sucking back up these three chemicals and so there 's this constant tapping on the shoulder this constant signaling to the next cell . amphetamines work in the same way but also increase their release . ecstacy works like speed but just causes comparatively more serotonin release.after awhile , the next nerve may be like enough already and down-regulate its receptors to turn down the volume . it puts in earplugs . so you need more and more of the drug to get the same effect , and then when you 're not on the drug you may feel crappy because normal volume transmission just isn 't getting through.antidepressants are thought to work along similar mechanisms . people who are depressed appear to have elevated levels of monoamine oxidase in their brain . that 's the enzyme that breaks down those neurotransmitters , and so if you have too much of that enzyme in critical parts of your brain , as the study show — the black circles are the levels in the brains of depressed individuals , and white circles that of the healthy individuals , if your levels of your neurotransmitter-eating enzyme is elevated , then your levels of neurotransmitters drops , and you become depressed , or so the theory goes.so a number of different classes of drugs have been developed . the tricyclic antidepressants , named because they have three rings like a tricycle , appear to block norepinephrine and dopamine re-uptake , and so even though your enzymes may be eating these up at an accelerated rate , what gets released sticks around longer . then there were the ssris like prozac , the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors . now you know what that means — just blocks the reuptake of serotonin . then there are drugs that just block the reuptake of norepinephrine . or more dopamine . or the opposite . but if the problem is too high levels of monoamine oxidase , why not just block the enzyme ? make a monoamine oxidase inhibitor — and of course they did , but they 're considered drugs of last resort because of serious side effects , not the least of which is the dreaded " cheese effect , " where eating certain foods while on the drug can have potentially fatal consequences . if only there was a way to tamp down the activity of this enzyme without the whole bleed-into-your-brain-and-die thing.now we can finally talk about the latest theory as to why fruits and vegetables may improve our mood . there are inhibitors of the depression-associated enzyme in various plants . there are phytonutrients in spices , such as clove , oregano , cinnamon , and nutmeg , but people don 't eat enough spices to get enough into the brain . this dark green leafy has a lot , but its name is tobacco , which may actually be one of the reasons cigarettes make smokers feel so good . ok , but what if you don 't want brain bleeds or lung cancer ? well there is a phytonutrient found in apples , berries , and grapes , and kale , onions , and green tea that may indeed affect our brain biology enough to improve our mood.to see any graphs , charts , graphics , images , and quotes to which dr. greger may be referring , watch the above video . this is just an approximation of the audio contributed by ariel levitsky. i personally like the detail explanations you give . your illustrations and analogies are excellent and the fact that you discuss the process or mechanisms helps to educate us . three things are important : 1 . length of the video , for me 2 – 4 minutes is ideal . 2 . summarize early and at the end the meaning so the reader knows what action they might want to take . 3 . humor – i always enjoy this.i ’ ve sent countless number of people to your website as the best way to stay up to date on nutrition . it is much better than coursera courses i ’ ve taken on nutrition and the shortness of the daily message is an excellent way to parse out the information . i must remember to update my donations , my credit card expired and i just noticed that donations had stopped . you are providing a fantastic service to all of us … . thank you ! thank you for your feedback ( and renewed monthly support ! ) . i was afraid this one was a bit too long – i think i got carried away ! for the first year of nutritionfacts.org i aimed for 2 minutes each , and for this second year shot for 3 or 4 . i ’ d be interested in what others have to say . i think your 2-4 is probably right in the sweet spot.i thought the length of this video was fine because it involved unpacking complex biochemical processes which require a more nuanced presentation . there ’ s obviously a point of diminishing returns in terms of both time and explication of content . 2 to 6 minutes is probably an optimal range to thoughtfully – and succinctly – convey the research . thank you for all that you do , dr. greger.one of the many great things about this site is if you don ’ t have the time or care to watch the video you can still read the transcript for it.anything under 10 minutes is good for me ! i prefer a longer video if it means that you have time to better explain a point or bring up important history and background . i think the quality of your videos have improved greatly this year because you haven ’ t tried to limit to the 2 minutes.of course , what ’ s best is to make each video as long as it needs to be in order to do the job . short is fine when that ’ s all that ’ s needed . longer is better if it is needed.thanks mike for bringing up the question ! thanks dr. greger for asking for people ’ s input ! i would say that anything below 10 minutes is perfectly fine . on that matter , you may be interested in checking this research coursera are using for their course design : https : / / plus.google.com / + coursera / posts / kwm1xpavpethttp : / / blog.coursera.org / post / 49750392396 / on-the-topic-of-boredomon a personal note , i don ’ t think this video was too long at all . your explanations of complex biological processes , coupled with references to the relevant medical literature , were the main reason i was so drawn to your work in the first place ( well , and you ’ re the carl sagan of nutrition as i read someone else saying a couple of weeks ago ! ) .the world is full of doctors saying “ do this [ because i say so , i ’ m an expert ! ] ” . am i supposed to trust them just because they call themselves doctors or show us a picture of themselves in a white coat and a stethoscope ? that doesn ’ t work for me.trust is something you build up for every single person you interact with . i implicitly trust you now because when i first learnt about you i could listen to your thought process and read enough of the literature you quote to know you ’ re not spinning it / making stuff up . but i can ’ t make someone else trust you … unless you are objectively a credible person all the time . so yes , keep providing us with all the detailed explanations ( and respective sources wherever appropriate ) = ) once again , thank you for all the amazing work ! sagan was actually my next door neighbor at cornell ! he was an advisor for one of the student groups i ran and so i had an excuse to go over and knock on his door a few times a year : ) wow ! what a coincidence ! wow , supernova of scientific minds ! you see , i ’ m not the only one who is completely blown away at how valuable your website is . daily in my office i mention nutritionfacts.org at least 10 times . “ hey did you guys see todays video ? todays blog ? ” no yokin ’ either ! please don ’ t ever stop creating , your work ( and all the people behind the scenes ) is just too valuable and critical to our nations health ! yes it is that important ! make your rabbit jealous – 1-2 bunches favorite greens ( beet greens , carrot tops , radish greens , etc . ) – 2 handfuls of raisins – 2 organic * apples , diced – 3 garlic scapes , diced – 3 green onions , chopped – handful pumpkin seeds – sea salt – black peppercook raisins and apple in a covered skillet with a splash water for 2-3 minutes . add greens and continue cooking until greens bright green . place garlic scapes , onions , and pumpkin seeds in a large bowl and top with cooked fruit and vegetables . season to taste with black pepper and sea salt . * apples rank 1st ( most contaminated ) for yet another year and spinach ranks # 6 ( up two from last year ’ s 8th ) in the “ dirty dozen : 12 foods to eat organic ” so choose organic. http : / / www.ewg.org / foodnews / list.php ~ complements of lovestobevegani definitely like the fact that you give detailed explanations . it makes your site unique and brilliant ( along with your films ) ! so long as you do a brief , simplified explanation first and then read more for those that like more detail – you ’ ve pleased everyone ! i appreciate the detailed explanations ; it helps to know how the body responds to good nutrition.this was great ! many people in my family suffer from depression and will benefit from this information . thank you.i think that medicine ’ s students got really to follow this site … difficult theories explained in few minutes and great stuff post nearly all the week long … great job as usual … feedback . i am a how and why person . i have rarely felt , that the videos been too complicated . you are doing a great job at simplifying and summarize some pretty heavy stuff out there , and for that i am grateful . if you feel that you need to explain something in 2,4,6 or even 8 minutes , then that ’ s what you should do . keep up the good work ! my vote is to have you continue with your current in-depth explanations . as a scientist i ’ m very interested in understanding the underlying mechanisms and i think diverging from your current methods will be disadvantageous to your overall message . i think the majority of the populous has the mentality of , ‘ sure eating plants is beneficial , but why should i stop eating meat ? ’ for me , understanding how the body functions and exactly how eating plant foods will affect particular enzymatic processes , as well as the deleterious effects of meat consumption , delivers a stronger message as to why i should make better dietary choices.ah , now i finally get mao inhibitors . for me , this was an excellent clip.one of your best “ because ” of the detailed explanation . excellent graphics and , as always , just the right amount of humor.please do not stop giving the detailed explanations on the underlying mechanisms.there are a million blogs out there , often run by people with limited or no scientific background , that say whatever fancies them without any justification . “ this cures this ” . “ that causes that ” . this site is so unique in1 ) its use of peer reviewed lit , 2 ) its use of * the latest * peer-reviewed lit , and3 ) actual explanations as to the context of the findings.if people want the bottom line , i think they could get that just by reading the caption in many cases . for those who want an explanation , they can take the time to watch the video . i never find the length to be a deterrent . some topics take more time to explain , some take less . it ’ s all good.this was fascinating ! i must be in the second camp . the only part i didn ’ t understand was why effexor is “ the opposite . ” what action does it do ? effexor is “ the opposite ” of drugs that block uptake of a single neurotransmitter , as it inhibits uptake of serotonin , norepinephrine , and ( weakly ) dopamine as well.you can judge for yourself whether that means three times the potential for side effects.thank you for the explanation darryl . i thought that what ’ s effexor does , but didn ’ t see how that was “ opposite ” of the ssris . i guess you could consider “ multiple ” to be “ opposite ” to “ single . ” thanks dr. greger – a great video . i have to say that my move to a plant-based diet has certainly contributed to being able to come off my anti-depressant medication after 4 years.keep up the great work ! i love the detailed explanations ! those who don ’ t just don ’ t need to listen as closely , but i forwarded this to several in my family , because the science behind the condition can really help to combat depression practically , and inexpensively , while benefiting the rest of the body . thanks again for such great info ! i find the length of your videos perfect for someone without a medical or scientific background , like me . you make otherwise complicated information easy to understand and utilize . i look forward to your videos and articles as they teach me enough in one sitting to absorb the information without overloading my brain . actually , i liked the 6 minute video better than the 2-3 minute videos- those leave me wanting more info . thank you for all the information that you share . it is meaningful and important ! i would love to eat tons of phytonutrients in grapes , etc . , but is it safe to eat the grapes and broccoli , etc. from california due to the fukushima fallout ? i don ’ t know if this is the page to bring it up but it is a major worry of mine.fukushima emissions had neglible impact on already present long-lived radionuclides in u.s. soils.it seems advisable to avoid seafood from ne coastal japan , and fungi and mushrooms ( which bioaccumulated radionuclides after chernobyl ) originating from fukushima , tochigi , and gunma provinces in japan if you ’ re concerned about dietary radioactivity.unfortunately , i don ’ t think any of us really know at this time just how bad things are from fukushima . i really don ’ t know.the other study “ … investigated by using the micronucleus test for anticlastogenic activity and the thiobarbituric acid assay for antioxidative activity . a single gastric intubation … 2 h prior to γ-ray irradiation … ” – in mice , published 1996.i contemplated deleting that last paragraph . i was struggling to find good studies that would support my intended point that the grapes and broccoli thinkabouddit seemed worried about may offer protection from subsequent radiation exposure . reservatrol from grapes and sulforophane from broccoli induce antioxidant response element ( are ) promoted gene transcription via the keap-nrf2 signalling pathway : hundreds of proteins , many of which participate in dna repair , recycling endogenous antioxidants , or are themselves antioxidants . the sort of activity one wants upregulated prior to exposure to millions of decay events from ingested / inhaled short-lived radionuclides.demonstrating chemoprotection from uvb induced carcinogenesis has become an oft repeated lab technique , but i couldn ’ t anything on resveratrol or sulforaphane vs. ionizing radiation ( α and β particles and γ-rays ) of the sort one is exposed to from i-131 , cs-137 or sr-90 . i suspect fewer labs have the facilities or desire to conduct that sort of experiment . this was fairly close , demonstrating radioprotection from co-60 by the compounds aitc and pitc found in cruciferous vegetables . if you are curious about the state of research , here are some recent reviews on radioprotective phytochemicals and herbs , the first two offering free access ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) 1 indian journal of natural products and resources 07 / 2011 ; 2 ( 2 ) : 137-150 : no conflict of interest statement.have you found any research which links alzheimer ’ s disease with animal protein ? conversely , will a vegetarian / vegan diet give one added protection from alzheimer ’ s disease ? i enjoy your videos . they are so informative . thank you.linda : you may be interested in a book by dr. barnard called “ power foods for the brain ” . he tries to make it broader than just “ alzheimer ’ s ” , but that is the main boogey man in the book , i believe.i haven ’ t actually had time to read the book myself , but my understanding is that dr. barnard presents the latest in scientific information between food and alzheimer ’ s . so , in reading that book , you should get the answer to your question – along with many other similar questions.hope that helps.dr. greger – i follow your work closely – thank you so much ! see you at lunch this saturday.the monoamine hypothesis never was a cause and effect explanation of mood disorder and is recently being supplemented – if not replaced – by a number of other theories . one such theory is depression by inflammation . there are an increasing number of articles even in the mainstream “ green journal ” ( american journal of psychiatry ) attesting to that . an interesting historical correlate that comes to mind immediately is st john ’ s wort ( hypericin ) thought for years to be an maoi , then found to inhibit the reuptake of several monoamines , is also an anti-inflammatory ( also antibacterial and antiviral ) compound.it ’ s difficult to imagine how any plant constituent could have any specific activity on a human neurosystem like reuptake inhibition of monoamines in neurons but totally understandable how the advanced anti-inflammatory and antiviral chemical system of plants could help with a similar function in other species.dr. gregor , i ’ ve been watching your videos for about 8 months now . i have not eaten any animal products for the last 6 full months . i like the “ why ” explanations you provide and especially appreciate your care in pointing out when you are describing emerging theories vs. well established mechanisms . video length of 4-7 minutes is just right for me . 2 minutes always feels too short . i also especially like the “ sources cited ” section , which is what sealed it for me ( made me vegan ) . i read many of the original studies cited in your videos for about 2 months before i was convinced that you knew what you were talking about and were giving subscribers complete and accurate information . you are providing an incredibly valuable service for which i am deeply grateful . i ’ m going to begin a regular donation to your organization . thank you ! i like the “ why ” as well as the “ what ” and “ how , ” and i enjoy and appreciate the videos and find the information very helpful . thank you for all the time you spend to give us this information and for sharing it so willingly so that all of us can benefit from it.i use to have very bad depression and only eating greens never worked.i had to raise my vitamin d levels with vitashine & sunshine and eat leafy greens daily for two weeks to experience an effect . they seem to have a synergistic effect.i hope you can do a video on how the fat soluble vitamins , a-d-k and their natural metabolites , like retinoic acid , play together to balanced the neurotransmitters and prevent an addictive personality in the first place.here is some interesting research i ’ ve gathered. http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1002 / cbf.955 / abstract http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc /

perhaps you ’ ll do a video on that one of these days . i ’ ll keep checking daily until you do , lol ! -nutrionally obsessedi am greatfull for these in depth explanations since i believe only that kind of info provides real significant and valuable knowledge . thank you very very much for this great work ! ! ! ! i thought it was easy to follow. thank you for all your videos / explanations . -e : ) your presentation of details and underlying mechanisms is essential for understanding . i agree with mike ’ s comments below . despite the length of your annual nutrition and medicine presentation , i greatly enjoy them.the more in depth explanations definitely add to the educational value in my view . you have a great way of making complex science concepts understandable , and i ’ m glad to see that most of the previous commenters seem to agree.ahh … .. thats why i smile when i eat my fruit and veggies … .the in-depth explanations explanations add to the educational value of the discussion , in my opinion . @ michael _ greger _ md : disqusthank you for this ! and i wanted to ask – are you aware of tony wrights theory in left in the dark , which touches on the evolutionary impact of our ancestral diet ( including the maoi they contain ) on the development of the human brain ? i love to know how and why and don ’ t mind a slightly longer video when it is needed for the explanation . it makes me feel smart to know a bit of the details : ) the short videos are the urgent news and what i can absorb immediately by each spoonful . time and attention span is the commodity when on the net . i do appreciate the detail very much , i need the explanation for my conversations with others . this helps in the holistic approach to mind , body , spirit . fact gathering is another method i us in healing and making change so the info is crucial in some instances . i love that your info is truly genuine from the research , some even decades ago . keep up the good work . you and your team are the best with the right intentions . yaay for us all . thank you ! ps. remember males speak in sentences and females speak in paragraphs.please continue to do the detailed explanations , i enjoy the longer videos – i rip them to mp3 and listen to the hour plus ones while i walk . you are right , though , you probably have two audiences , and if you have a topic that really requires more explanation , you might do both a long and a short version.i really enjoyed the ( audio ) of the video about vegetarians and vegans vs meat eaters and heart disease related death . the data driven presentation was exactly what i wanted to hear – material from someone who has done the reading . i like that you cite your sources too . it does save the rest of us the work we don ’ t really have time to do.i ’ ve been all over the place trying to decide what to eat to lose the fat that just accumulated all over my body , but especially in the middle , after stupidly letting myself get talked into a hysterectomy . ( that was only the mildest side effect of that nightmare surgery i experienced ) i have looked at gluten free ( doing it ) sugar free ( mostly ) and back and forth between paleo , protein with all carbs , low carb , mostly plant based , and while i have not had any luck with anything ( hormones are just very messed up ) i am glad to find that some of the things the paleo people had suggested to me are not true ( beans are bad , lentils are bad , peanuts are bad ) they got me eating butter ( i do mostly cook with olive oil ) and eating too much meat and dairy , because they were so positive that it was healthier . but i think that diet only works on the young and if you are weight lifting.i am now adding much fruit ( they scared me off that ) and keeping up adding as many vegetables and greens and spices and herbs as possible , while cutting way back on the meat and using only vegetable broth for cooking.excellent public service you are providing . i am linking my vegetarian friends and a few others.i have already added flax seed to my salads thanks to the one long broadcast , and have learned a number of things from the shorter ones.best , karendr . greger has dispelled the low carb myth here http : / / atkinsexposed.org / karen : i just started reading the starch solution by dr. mcdouggall . he not only has some great nutritional information in that book , but he has a meal plan and recipes . it would be a healthy way to loose weight.another option is a free on-line program called the 21 day kickstart . they have 3 weeks of meal plans and recipes . they also have cooking videos and a moderated forum where you can ask questions . this program would be another healthy , safe way to loose weight . if you are interested , you can register here : http : / / support.pcrm.org / site / pageserver ?

PLAIN-2739	do dental x-rays cause brain tumors ? every year , doctors cause an estimated 29,000 cancers a year dosing patients with x-rays during cat scans . what about dentists ? 100 million americans are exposed to dental x-rays every year , but what about the lead apron and the thyroid shield ? doesn 't that cover up all your vital organs ? all your vital organs except one , called the brain . dental x-rays and risk of meningioma . the objective of this study was to examine the association between dental x-rays — the most common artificial source of ionizing radiation — and the risk of intracranial meningioma , the most common type of brain tumor.they found that those who report ever having a bitewing x-ray had twice the odds of a brain tumor , and those that got a panoramic series — the full mouth x-rays – before age 10 had nearly 5 times the odds.so does this mean dental x-rays cause brain tumors ? well , the jury is still out . just because dental x-rays are associated with brain tumors , argues a group of dental radiologists , doesn 't necessarily mean the x-rays caused the brain tumors — maybe brain tumors caused the x-rays ! seriously — they criticized the paper for not entertaining alternative explanations , such as the facial pain that can be caused by brain tumors triggering the need for dental radiographs , meaning you go to your dentist because your face hurts and your dentist orders some x-rays . little do either of you know it could have been a brain tumor all along . or maybe there 's a third variable , such as head trauma resulting in both additional x-rays and brain tumors . getting hit in the head as a kid increases your risk of developing a brain tumor and getting hit in the head is also a good way to end up in a dentist chair getting x-rays for broken teeth . while more research is being done , the bottomline is , as with all sources of artificial ionizing radiation , considered use of this modifiable risk factor may be of benefit to patients . this means that the dentist should consider carefully the justification for every exposure . this means dentists should not prescribe routine dental x-rays at preset intervals for all patients , like every 6 months or every year or whatever . says who ? says the official recommendations of the american dental association . dentists should not prescribe routine dental x-rays at preset intervals . there is little evidence to support irradiating people looking at all the teeth in search of hidden problems in asymptomatic patients . accordingly , dentists should select patients wisely – only take x-rays when there is patient-specific reason to believe there is a reasonable expectation the x-rays will offer unique information influencing diagnosis or treatment . i was just at the dentist for a routine cleaning about a week ago and they requested several x rays from me . i ’ ve had several x rays a few years back and i was concerned about the all the radiation . when i declined , his entire staff looked at me as if i was some kind ’ ve eccentric nut . thanks for posting this ! maybe bring some copies of those articles to give to them at your next checkup ! crap. a friend just got operated on for this kind of a cancer a few months ago . ( with a good outcome , we think . ) he ’ s super health conscious and * exactly * the type to be meticulous in getting all the recommended tooth xrays.last time i went to the dentist i told the tech i was declining x-rays . minutes later the dentist walks in and asks why . i told her i wanted to limit radiation exposure as much as possible . she gave a condescending chuckle ( i am a physician ) and said , “ the amount of radiation is very low . much less than an mri . ” i ’ ve encountered my fair share of condescending chuckles ! the pat answer i so often hear is , “ you get more radiation from the sun ” . but , my fave has to be ( notoriously phrased in question form ) , “ do you fly in airplanes ? ” you mean , as opposed to using my wings , or teleportation ? ; ) tell your dentist that dr. john gofman , professor of medical physics at uc berkeley & the discover of uranium-232 and 233 , warned that the risk of cancer goes up with the amount of radiation . and the largest source of radiation for us as people is medical radiation . yes , we get radiation from the sun , background radiation and the like , but that ’ s not as hazardous as the ionizing radiation that comes from xrays . so if your dentist tries to pat you on the head , come preprared with the facts , and you can pat right back on his ignorant crown.this is a great wording . this makes a lot of sense to me . thanks for taking the time to write this out.i wish i would have been this prepared at my dentist appointment this morning ! when i stated that i was concerned about my brain being exposed to the radiation after they recommended an x-ray , they also chuckled claiming that people receive more radiation from the sun … same exact response from my dentist and his assistants , as if they ’ re all programmed by the same source ( ada ? ) , along with spiel about how beneficial and benign flouride is . this harmful ignorance is but one example of the massive sickness in the sick care system – the allopathic conveyer belt keeps moving , with massive inertia.pick up a basic toxicology text ( i bet you could find one on amazon for a penny ) and bookmark the section for her where carcinogens are defined as having no threshold . you need a single molecule ( whether it ’ s a radical or some other form of carcinogen ) to damage a single dna molecule within a single cell , and if that single dna molecule is replicated , you have the opportunity for cancerous growth.obviously , we are surrounded by carcinogenic compounds and radiation that are just a product of our natural world , and our body has defense mechanisms to keep things in check . but why expose yourself to any more than is necessary ? like the other dentist comment below “ you get more from the sun ” … and why would i want to add any radiation on top of that ? ! just because radiation is unavoidable , that doesn ’ t make it harmless and it doesn ’ t mean you should go out of your way to get more than you have to ! per your source : “ exposure to some dental x-rays performed in the past , when radiation exposure was greater than in the current era ” , did your research indicate that current levels of exposure also put us at risk ? if so , which articles showed that . i would like to be well prepared when addressing this with my dentist ( as he is my uncle ) .like most truisms , how can this connection not make sense ? my question has always been when they are x-raying your mouth , what insures the x-ray stops at the target instead of continuing to travel through your head into your brain ? i think we all know the answer . nothing stands btween the two ! the fact that the machine isn ’ t pointed at your brain makes a difference.how about the fact that its pointed at something far more important than your brain . your thyroid.i don ’ t recall ever having a dental xray in which the device was pointed at my thyroid . it ’ s usually pointed horizontally , or very close , while the thyroid is located below the jawline , almost on a level with the collarbones.i will defer to the radiation physicists to wade into the specifics of scatter and exposure of the thyroid vs brain . the key point is to minimize exposure to x-rays as much as possible . from a clinical stand point there is a difference between using x-rays to help diagnose a problem vs recommending x-rays as routine for a population without symptoms or signs . the ada is no longer recommending routine dental x-rays . even with some populations like those with a sprained ankle we now have the ottawa guidelines based on bayesian math to help avoid up to 30 % of x-rays while reducing costs , time in er and no decrease in quality . another example is the difference between using mammography to help diagnose a breast lump vs routine screening women with no symptoms . the nordic cochrane collaboration booklet on screening mammography is a must read for any woman considering a “ routine ” screening mammogram . for those who want to delve into the science and studies in depth peter gotzsche ’ s book is recommended . you can view a brief 8 minute video of peter gotzsche done at last fall ’ s mcdougall advanced study weekend on john mcdougall ’ s website … http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / videos / advanced-study-weekend-experts / peter-gotzsche-01 / and the booklet . as peter gotzsche points out there are problems beyond the radiation exposure . once armed with an understanding of the problems with “ routine ” x-rays … not just exposure but other issues including errors in administering and over diagnosis … you will be better able to “ just say no ” .i appreciate the information and agree with your caveats , don.now rising 75 , i was able to innocently enjoy wiggling my toes in the fluoroscopy machine and see my bones moving during shoe-fitting . i didn ’ t enjoy the frequent chest-xrays looking for tb at least in part because i never got to see them . but as my dad was away dying of tb , i understood the need . i ’ m sure i didn ’ t get as many dental xrays as other kids since , with both parents disabled , we subsisted on the dole , which didn ’ t include dental care other than pulling teeth when they became problematic . but i did get a lot of standard dental xrays in adulthood courtesy of being a pre-fluoridation kid . all in all , it ’ s probably a wonder i don ’ t glow in the dark.nevertheless , i ’ m glad that my dentist today uses an ultra-low-power direct-read device , and doesn ’ t take any more shots than he must for diagnosis . and i ’ ve avoided routine mammos all my adult life , reckoning that all the irradiation my chest got from the public health looking at my lungs was probably more than enough to go on with for one lifetime.yes … things have changed over the years . i converted my tb test as a 3rd year family medicine resident . when i went to work for kaiser permanente we were requiring all skin test positives to get annual chest x-rays . this was a state regulation written by a cardiologist interestingly enough . i was in charge of employee health at the time . i worked with the infectious disease and pulmonary departments to come up with a four question survey . we applied for and received program variance from the state . we reserved the chest x-rays for those who answered yes to any of the four questions . better quality , better patient satisfaction and lower cost.you better be glad you were a pre fluoride kid . probably why you are alive at 75 . it ’ s probably as bad for you as xrayshave you ever heard of radiation scatter. you can aim it but it is going to scatter to some extent so your thyroid and brain. and if you don ’ t get far enough away to the one taking the xray if there is no sheildthe is going to be scatter and that is going to your brain and thyroid . there is no way to keep that from happening.probably true . but below a certain level of intensity / frequency it doesn ’ t seem to matter.is there any connection with amalgam fillings scattering the radiation ? i have a large filling in a lower molar , which to my thinking could potentially scatter a lot of those rays directly up at my brain.thank you i will use your words next time and tell others when offered check-up x-rays.good thought-provoking video , dr. greger . there is no doubt that we should all avoid unnecessary exposure to x-rays.to put this safety concern in perspective , however , please note that the equivalent dose from each dental radiograph compares favourably to other radiation sources such as cosmic ray dose during a coast-to-coast round trip flight , house-hold radon gas dose and even doses from food sources such as brazil nuts . for example , see the table provided on the public health england website : http : / / www.hpa.org.uk / topics / radiation / understandingradiation / understandingradiationtopics / dosecomparisonsforionisingradiation / furthermore , according to the united states nuclear regulatory commission ’ s website : http : / / www.nrc.gov / reading-rm / doc-collections / fact-sheets / bio-effects-radiation.html “ about half of the total annual average u.s. individual ’ s radiation exposure comes from natural sources . the other half is mostly from diagnostic medical procedures . the average annual radiation exposure from natural sources is about 310 millirem ( 3.1 millisieverts or msv ) . radon and thoron gases account for two-thirds of this exposure , while cosmic , terrestrial , and internal radiation account for the remainder . no adverse health effects have been discerned from doses arising from these levels of natural radiation exposure . ” you ’ re back ! thank goodness ! ! ! thanks , veganrunner ! it ’ s good to be back.dr. greger , the video is missing a crucial piece of information – are you referring to standard x-rays or digital. which purportedly use 90 % less radiation than standard machines ? i also wonder if the risk goes up based on the number of dental x-rays you ’ ve had . i ’ m in my 30s now and worry about the panoramic x-rays i had in my teens when i got braces . the dentist claimed i wasn ’ t sitting still ( though , i swore the machine was shaking ) and re-did the x-ray several times . i also get the bite-wing x-rays , but try to put them off to about every 3 years instead of the 1.5 – 2 that my dentist recommends . maybe i will avoid them altogether now that i ’ ve seem this video . though , my dentist also claims the “ digital ” x-rays use less radiation . “ though , my dentist also claims the “ digital ” x-rays use less radiation ” he was probably told that from the guy who sold him the machine.the dose reduction for digital is dependent on the short exposure capabilities of the x-ray machine and what kind of film the digital sensor is replacing : health physics society : dental patient issuesa typical skin exposure for group d film ( ultraspeed ) is about 300 mr , for group e ( ektaspeed ) about 150 mr , and for group f ( insight ) about 110-120 mr . one digital-imaging manufacturer recommends setting the exposure for its equipment at about 20 % of d-speed film , or about 60 mr . some institutions have found that approximately a 50 % decrease from f-speed film provides a good image.it is possible that digital imaging may require as much exposure as film if the user does not consciously reset the x-ray machine to lower exposure or if the x-ray machine timer cannot accommodate the short exposure times ( usually an old machine , not the current models ) . with respect to digital panoramic radiographs , there appears to be no dose reduction compared with film-based panoramic images because there is already a large dose reduction as a result of use of intensifying screens in the panoramic cassettes.so digital seems to offer about a 50 % dose reduction from the fastest film . if only film is available , ask for f speed film.of course the ada found flaws in the study . they make a ton of money every year off of xrays . got to keep those guys paying their huge ada duesmy hygenist kept wanting to x-ray my mouth as she “ couldn ’ t quite get the picture right . ” after 3 or 4 tries , i said “ that ’ s enough ! ” she became very defensive and said that there was absolutely “ no problem ” and that it was digital . i felt as though she truly felt i was an extremist.the exact thing happened to me too ! i was so upset , i never went back . of course my new dentist is giving me the take x-rays or find a new dentist ultamatum.anything this aggressively insistent comes from above . look at the “ smart ” meter issue – same thing.do we need dental insurance reform ? i ’ ve had before and after x-rays because dentists say it ’ s needed to prove the work was done.i ’ ve been refusing dental x-rays for years , especially when the young , inexperienced ( usually dumb ) ‘ technician ’ has to do them over . . .and over . . . and over because she doesn ’ t know how to position the beam correctly . when the dentist says look we “ have ” to do a full set , i know , and he knows , it ’ s really only because of the higher insurance reimbursement he gets . forget it , i say please , just do this tooth and that tooth and the remainder by visual inspection . dentists , like doctors , work for us — not vice versa.dr. greger , would you recommend that children also not get dental x-rays ? i wish we had been declining them all these years . my son has never had a cavity , so i ’ m not really sure what the point was.i am a hygienist in a general practice . in one instance , we had a young patient with no clinically visible dental caries . we sent that child to a pedodontist as we were unable to take successful bitewing radiographs . the radiographs that ended up being taken at the pedo office revealed several cavities between the posterior teeth that were not visible clinically . i agree that need for radiographs should be determined on an individual basis . there are many carious lesions that cannot be detected clinically . what does one say to the patient who finally has agreed to radiographs that show a large carious lesion between the teeth , or even an abscessed tooth , when they exclaim “ well how long has that been there ? ” i am a regular reader of nutritionfacts.org and agree with much of what is posted , however this is a reply from the hygienist ’ s point of view . i have been a dental hygienist for almost 30 years.i am also a dental hygienist and if you can not detect a large carious lesion on a baby tooth , even interproximal , visually then you need glassesas with any proposed health intervention ( or most actions in life , really ) i reckon its prudent to assess the risk / benefit ratio.it is true that dental decay will sometimes occur in areas where it can ’ t be detected without x-rays , and that if allowed to progress will result in the need for root therapy or loss of the tooth.it is also true , i think , that most people would consider the loss of a tooth a less serious outcome than a brain tumour . even so , losing a number of teeth can have a significant negative impact on a person ’ s overall health.it is also true that the radiation from digital dental x-rays is relatively small . ( this is easily measurable and in australia dentists will not be licensed to use equipment unless the radiation output is regularly tested independently – it ’ s not just what the x-ray machine salesman says ! ) i believe it also would be true that there would be other lifestyle factors besides dental x-rays that would contribute to one ’ s risk of brain tumour.a person ’ s individual risk that dental decay would be present would also be determined by things like diet and flossing skill & diligence.so , all these things need to be considered , but in the end an individual ’ s informed decision should be respected.i work with my husband who is a dentist , and his recommendations for x-rays do vary with his knowledge of a patient ’ s previous decay history , their dental hygiene and what he can ascertain of their diet ( ie the likelihood of decay being present ) .if a patient declines x-rays , he does explain that there may be decay present that he can ’ t see , and he does point out that dental x-rays represent a very small percentage of the average person ’ s total radiation exposure , but then respects their informed decision as being their own choice for their own body – there are no condescending chuckles . we are the patient ’ s partners in their oral healthcare . ( we also have a range of materials by drs fuhrman , esselstyn , and barnard as well as forks over knives in our reception area . ) there have been many instances where we have been able to save teeth with minimal restorative work because x-rays were taken . likewise , there have been many instances when we have taken x-rays and not found any decay , so , in hindsight , they weren ’ t necessary . ( that darned hindsight that makes decisions so easy – if only we had it beforehand ! ) we ’ re always grateful for the info and discussion on this site as we continue to educate ourselves : ) i ’ ve been treated as an eccentric nut and a problem patient after refusing annual mammograms ( after more than 20 years of them ) — treated with such condescension and having technicians calling me at home to remind me of the “ need ” for them because someone above them told them they had to call me ( some of techs sound like they ’ d rather be digging out a sewer than making that call . ) at the dentist , they get very adamant about x-rays , too . you have to be tough , stick to your guns , and be your own health advocate.i work in a dentist off ice and have for 30 years . we just got the hand held nomad xray unit about 3 years ago . we don ’ t have to leave the room to take xays so they say . i have just been diagnosed with a mengioma that i did not have 2 years ago . it was checked after a car wreck and all was good 2 years ago . it is fast growing and requires brain surgery . don ’ t let them force you . i bet you won ’ t see them giving their families xrays every 6 months or year . they get them when neededbellasue02 : i ’ m so sorry to hear about your cancer . your story is very powerful and gives me food for thought since my dentist appointment is coming up very soon.can you elaborate on what you mean by , “ they get them when needed . ” ? what criteria makes getting an xray wise ? i am trying to figure out when it is appropriate to get an xray and when it is unnecessary.i ’ m hoping it is benign but it is a meningioma . i would get them when something is sensitive or looks like you may have a cavity . a good dentist or hygienist can usually see by direct vision or during the cleaning by feel if something is going on . if something looks or feels different than it should i would let them get an x-ray . maybe just a couple of bitewings once every 2 years . i have worked for dentist that forced people to get a full mouth every time the insurance would pay for it . that use to be every 2 years until dentist abused it and now every 5 years . i would be sure also it is digital . if a dentist doesn ’ t care enough to spend extra money to protect his patients go somewhere else.bellasue02 : thank you so much for your reply . that sense of a guideline is super-helpful.again , i ’ m so sorry to hear about the tumor . i ’ m keeping my fingers crossed for you.dr. greger , how about a video on cavity causing foods … .. and things we can do to prevent the “ need ” for dental x-rays in the first place . there are vegan foods ( certain grains and unripe-pineapple ) that cause me intense tooth pain , so it has been relatively easy for me to abstain from foods that seem to be compromising the integrity of my teeth . interestingly , if i eat sprouted bread instead of non-sprouted i don ’ t experience tooth pain . experience has led me to believe that it isn ’ t an issue of vegan vs. meat , dairy , egg in causing cavities / tooth problems , but maybe meat , dairy , egg harm the teeth in their own ways ? look into theobromine from chocolate ( cacao plant ) for cavity prevention and then try raw cacao beans . “ theodent ” brand toothpaste is also recommended to try . good luck.i ’ d would love to have a copy of the official recommendations of the ada to bring with me on my next dental visit in july . where can i get this ? i tried your links but could only get the abstract which didn ’ t include the recommendations.i actually found it with a google search . for those of you interested : http : / / ccnmtl.columbia.edu / broadcast / hs / dental / oralradiology2 / 2008 / jada.pdfthank you ! this brings up a related topic . a lot of people say irradiated food is safe . the more i hear it the less i believe it . look at his blurb from ncsu : what happens when a food is irradiated ? when ionizing radiation passes through a foodproduct , some energy is absorbed by some chemicalbonds . some bonds rupture and produce free radicalswhich are highly reactive and unstable . theyinstantaneously rejoin with neighboring compoundsand the results are called radiolytic compounds.end of snip.i ’ ve learned here that free radicals are bad . really bad . but it seems the machine says the free radicals caused by ionizing radiation are safe . and chock full of natural antioxidants i bet too.the late phd dr john garthman , an expert on ex-rays said there is no such such thing as a safe ex-ray and if a doctor says they are safe he is either lying or incompetent . one ex-ray is known to be a carcinogen … .. one of my doctors told me it , s no more harm then the radiation you get when you fly across the country but dr garthman said that , s not how ex-rays work they go right thru the body .the late dr garthmann was a professor at uc at irvine and was considered america , s foremost expert on ex-rays.my husband claims that i am being paranoid , but i call it informed . the dentists and physicians alike the various industries who are poisoning us for their profit claim that there is more radiation skiing in the rockies , flying in an airplane than there is from full body scanners and full mouth scans.but , i already have background radiation as a result of living in the rockies for over 20 years , flying in airplanes , and i don ’ t need more so that dentists or physicians can be protected from potential law suits.i had a full body ct scan when i fractured my spine as well as an x-ray . the second time , i chose not to go to the doctor . hence , no scan . instead , i wore my brace , and am gradually getting stronger so i can do weight bearing exercise.the dentist and periodontist go away with one full mouth scan , but no more . i ’ m not falling for that prevention routine again . they are protecting themselves , not my health ! i will copy the study and give them a copy when i go to the periodontist next week . thank you , dr. greger.i wonder if that was the reason my father died on a brain tumor the size of an ostrich egg on his brain in 1956 . we suspected it was because of government secrecy.i am slightly skeptical . how about increased mobile / cell phone use ? that ’ s much longer exposure compare to occasional dental x-raysthe important difference is the wavelength . ultrashort length x-rays pack such a strong punch it causes chemical bonds to break . phones emit low energy microwaves that make molecules bounce around . i grant you , boiling your brain with microwaves is not too smart either . but the two types of radiation are many orders of magnitude different in energy.where ’ s the logic in stating that you are skeptical of one hazard warning because there is another one ? they ’ re both hazardous and if one is “ more ” hazardous or risky it does not negate the risk of the other . look up ‘ bioaccumulation ’ .dr. greger covers cell phones here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / do-cell-phones-cause-cancer / i have been told that many shipping containers containing imported food and beverages arriving into usa ports are x-rayed … .the x-rays peering into the containers , revealing possible contraband , weapons , etc . i wonder what effect this has on food . maybe the pure spring and mineral waters aren ’ t so pure after being x-rayed . berries , supplements , fruits , veggies , you name it . if it is in a container it might be getting zapped . anyone out there have any clarity on this ? dr. greger , any veritable studies examining food integrity as a result of shipping containers being x-rayed ? eat local.x-rays pass through the food , and yes the plants may be harmed by that process , but i think we harm them more when we chew and swallow them . i wouldn ’ t worry too much about the plants health.radiation given at the level of dental exposure has recently been questioned as to whether it could actually be ‘ good ’ for you . some claim that the body actually overshoots the assault and results in a healing episode . interesting as this sounds i ’ m sure it is not ready for prime time . point being though is that radiation does it ’ s damage by creation of free radicals . these harmful ions are drenched and made harmless by antioxidants . you are able to keep yourself safe during dental xrays by making sure that your antioxidant levels are up . it is that simple . the video points out that there are 100 ’ s of millions of dental xrays taken every year . this number does not correlate with the number of brain cancers . cancer happens in bodies with chronic inflamation . get healthy and stop worrying . stress is risk factor number one . of course beware of dentists who take ‘ routine ’ xrays . nothing is routine when it comes to the human body . timely xrays can help to diagnose and head off big problems . the decision of when they should be taken should come with some thought . be well , dr.markthe point of my comment was that , contrary to my ( former ) dentist ’ s dismissive remark , an mri does not employ radiation.i was able to refuse “ as per the official recommendation of the american dental association ” ! i just got a blank stare . — — — – help — — — please direct me to this legal clause that says i can refuse x-rays per the official recommendation — — — — please print this out clearer — — — – all i can find that if i refuse — — — — dentist can refuse treatment ? ? ? like don ’ t want to wear helmet — no go-cart rides for you ! ! ! ! dennisfind a biological dentist or another standard one who has thought his way out of the brainwash . good luck.where can i find a dentist who doesn ’ t take xrays all the time ? it seems the 2006 ada recommendation “ dentists should not prescribe routine dental radiographs at preset intervals to all patients ” might have been supplanted . the 2012 ada dental radiograph guidelines still recommend initial and regular interval x-rays for just about everyone but toothless adults – posterior bitewing radiographs for asymptomatic adults at low risk of dental carries at 2-3 year intervals , and for other patient groups at shorter intervals.i went to the dentist today and refused xrays . they spent more time talking to me saying that i need to get xrays than they did cleaning my teeth . they were very surprised that the ada would not recommend getting xrays . they said they will not clean my teeth if i do not have an xray done at least once every 2 years ! ! ! ! and that is only for patients that have good oral health . how is that even legal ? this ticks me off . also , i see the ada document is from 2006. http : / / ccnmtl.columbia.edu / broadcast / hs / dental / oralradiology2 / 2008 / jada.pdf they have a new one from 2012 . are they reverting what they said in 2006 because of pressure from dentist offices ? a stronger hypothesis is that the pressure comes from the radioimaging industry who make the expensive machines and lobby and / or bribe the ada . happens all day , everyday , with corrupting lobbyists and their corrupted congressperson targets . there is raging corporitis in every area.my young son who is due to turn 7 later this month ( december 2013 ) is due to have an x-ray of his skull next week here in england as he suffers from a very rare genetic disorder ( occipital horn syndrome ) and the clinical genetic paediatricians want to look at his occipital prominences in more detail ( the occipital bone is a saucer-shaped membrane bone situated at the back and lower part of the cranium ) . sorry to sound naïve but does dr. greger ( or anyone else here ) know if the full mouth ( panoramic ) x-rays referred to here ( in the accompanying video ) would be the same procedure and method ( and therefore present the same degree of invasiveness ) as for a skull x-ray ? whilst we are or course keen to learn more about our son ’ s condition , understandably we have no wish to put him at risk from any other consequences from the radiation risk posed if it ’ s not entirely necessary . any comments would be most gratefully received . many thanks , steve kat least insist on digital , although they may counter that digital is not appropriate in your son ’ s situation . if so , corroborate that claim with an independent source.i have been going to the same dentist for about 30 years . when i began there i was still in my childbearing years , pregnant three times after i started going to him . when i realized i could get out of getting xrays by being pregnant , i would say , “ well , i might be pregnant and not know it yet . ” then when i got to old to be believed about that , i just said i didn ’ t want the extra expense that xrays cost . so , i am thankful that i have avoided about 60 dental xrays over the years . my mom was a nurse and told me long ago that xrays were dangerous.hahahaha ! i love your sense of humor ! enenews dot com has been reporting on fukushima daily.people refuse dental xrays at the office i work at all the time . however , you can have a painless abscess or an interproximal cavity and have no pain . an xray is the only way to detect these things . digital xrays have 90 % less radiation . i don ’ t give my patients a hard time if they don ’ t get their xrays , but don ’ t blame the dental staff when you lose a tooth , or get killed by a tooth abscess.dentist are giving 3 or 4 year olds panoramic xrays . what would be the reason other than to make money . what would you need to see on a pano of a healthy child that young . panos do not show cavities or abcesses clearly . the are good to show widom teeth but a child would not need one . now i read anyone that gets that kind of exposure before age 10 has a 5 times more chance of getting a brain tumor from the radiation . i bet you won ’ t see dentist x-ray their own children at that age . don ’ t let them do it . it ’ s not neededaww crap : ( interestingly , they removed that sentence from the revised 2012 version of the document . american dental association , brain disease , brain health , brain tumors , cancer , dental health , head trauma , iatrogenic , meningioma , pain , radiation , thyroid health , x-rays getting bitewing or full mouth ( panoramic ) x-rays at the dentist may be associated with an increased risk of meningioma , the most common type of brain tumor . i was just actually at the dentist for my check-up and was again offered a set of full mouth x-rays ( because i was " due " ) . normally when i refuse routine dental x-rays i 've just explained that i try to minimize my radiation exposure , but this time i was able to refuse " as per the official recommendation of the american dental association " ! i just got a blank stare.more on avoiding brain tumors in : this is the third in a five part series on preventing and mediating the adverse effects of radiation exposure . the first , fukushima and radioactivity in seafood , described the natural and artificial sources of radioactive isotopes in our diet . the last video , cancer risk from ct scan radiation , detailed the estimated 29,000 cancers that doctors cause with cat scans every year . in my next video , mediating radiation exposure from air travel , i talk about those full-body scanners in airports and i 'll close out with ways to mediate all these risks with reducing radiation damage with ginger and lemon balm.for more context , check out my associated blogs : are dental x-rays safe ?

PLAIN-2749	should probiotics be taken before , during , or after meals ? though foods may be better carriers for probiotics than supplements , if one does choose to go with supplements , should they be taken before , during , or after meals ? when it comes to probiotic supplements sold in capsules the commercial literature is often confusing in that sometimes the consumer is instructed to take the probiotics with meals , sometimes before or after meals , and occasionally on an empty stomach . this has led to serious confusion for the industry and the consumer . surprisingly it doesn 't appear as if any studies had ever examined this question , until now.to be able to measure probiotic concentrations , minute by minute throughout the process , they had to build a fake digestive tract , a fake stomach and intestines , but complete with real saliva and digestive enzymes , acid , bile , etc . what did they find ? here 's the survival of three different types of probiotics before , during , and after meals , and separately in oatmeal and milk , milk alone , apple juice , juice , or water.conclusion : probiotic bacterial survival was best when provided within 30 minutes before or simultaneously with a meal or beverage that contained some fat content . thanks again dr. greger for this informative video ! ! how about hyperactive intestines . would probiotics and prebiotics help in that situation ? hyperactivity can be a result of the variety of cells trying to compensate for intestinal destruction while fighting pathogens in the gut , so i personally believe that pre and probiotics , but mainly food culture , can assist in helping the rebuilding , maintenance and battle-for-good in your gut . also , just to note , prebiotics are usually fibers ( or whatever non digestible substance ) that promotes growth , well being and activity for gut flora.so ﻿ eating a pro-biotic vegan yogurt … would that be good ? eating a probiotic yogurt may help , just be wary of the sugar content . shoot for non-sweetened varieties and consume it with a whole fruit . aside from probiotic yogurts though , consuming more fermented / cultured foods ( and probiotic supplements if you desire , i don ’ t rely on them ) will aid in the defense line and repair crew of your gut.skip the dairy and go directly to whole fruits and vegis , grains , starches . the dairy causes mucus which adds to the gut trying to rid the body of them . the fiberous natural foods will heal the gut , sweep it clean , and give the little gut bacteria something to grow on.i heard the man say fat content . seems odd that your interpretation did not include fat.the question was about vegan yogurt : ) man we are getting so smart.re : probiotics for diarrheaseven years ago , i had a serious case ( all 10 biopsies came back positive ) of microscopic colitis . i had been sick — and getting progressively worse — for several months , had become severely lactose intolerant , and had lost 15 pounds . other options eliminated ( liver nearly destroyed , with talk of transplant possibly necessary ) , my gastroenterologist said the only remaining option was corticosteroids . having spent a lifetime keeping my weight under control , i refused , saying i ’ d rather die , and , frankly , expected to do just that.my husband put me on an “ all white food diet ” ( nothing to stress the colon ) that he found on the internet and bought the most potent probiotics he could find . with his treatment , i was completely cured in about six weeks.i am a firm believer of probiotics … and very glad i refused the steroids.ediep you should review our probiotic products. http : / / www.myxcellentchoice.com / riverwoods23 . our formulator john r taylor naturopath and author of the wonder of probiotics collaborated with world renowned probiotic expert dr. khem shahani . dr. khem shahani was a pioneer in the field of probiotics and is widely regarded as one of the world ’ s leading probiotic authorities on their role in digestive health and immune response.what was on your “ all white food ” diet ? a question we have all pondered … . thanks ! i have a question … are probiotics recommended as a daily supplement or just as a “ treatment ” for a period of time after taking antibiotics ( or for some other digestive issue ) ? if the latter , for how long should they be taken ? from my experience , if you needed them once , better keep taking them . they ’ re expensive , so i ’ ve tried dropping them after all seems well , but every time i do , it isn ’ t long before problems begin to resurface.you only need to take them a few times before the bacteria in you gut will self colonize . adding more probiotics after this point is pointless . typically diet determines which strain will proliferate.there are very few , if any , probiotic strains that actually colonize ( they are foreign organisms to the body after all ) , most do not last . so yes , you need to take them on a regular basis.gut bacteria feed on soluble fiber and the colony grows . plant food is known as a prebiotic for this reason . the gut is an ecosystem of its own , the flora is not threatened by the bodies immune system . there is no evidence to conclude that one must continue taking probiotics after the gut is colonized . yes they are foreign , but they are not circulating throughout the blood stream.and is their ability to remain within the gut dependent upon the existence of an appendix ? there are many variables here … just went to a seminar where the phd recommended 2 weeks on and 2 weeks off . if the bacteria get too used to being supplemented , they could get lazy and not reproduce . if you give them a little shock every 2 weeks , they remain strong . i am in the midst of trying it.would be good to have a reference to evidence for this if know.i particularly like when you make written comments on the audio as i often do not have time to listen to the complete audio version . i think i am a visual learner , rather than auditory . mthx , love you info.does cooking kill the probiotics in a food ? does tempeh contain probiotics ? can tempeh be eaten straight from the package without cooking ? the answers are : yes , no and no . tempeh does not contain any known probiotic . unless specifically added no naturally fermented product can contain probiotics . these have to be added specifically . as tempeh is a fungus , it is wiser to fry or cook it before eating.a slight tangent , but as living with pets has been associated with reduced infections and allergies in children ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-cats-or-dogs-more-protective-for-childrens-health / ) , i thought this recent paper examining the microbiota of families with dogs was worth sharing . dogs are bringing a bit of nature back into our sanitary , but less biotically diverse households , and sharing it with us : song , se jin , et al . “ cohabiting family members share microbiota with one another and with their dogs . ” elife 2 ( 2013 ) . http : / / elife.elifesciences.org / content / 2 / e00458dogs : the probiotic for your household.darryl : the study you point out reminds me of a study that i saw summarized on tv not too long ago . they looked at the bacteria on the skins of a team of roller derby ( ? i think it was that – where they race around a tract in teams on roller skates ) women . they looked before and after a game . after the game , the bacteria had changed significantly . the team members were sharing a lot more bacteria with each other . or something like that.my ( great dane ) dog lies on my lap on the couch and licks my face in the morning to get me up . i imagine i ’ m just swimming in his microbiota ( a new word for me ) . but as long as it ’ s mutual , i guess i have no reason to be grossed out.thanks for bringing this up.i love it when a doctor tells me i have an excuse to eat , “ a meal or beverage that contained some fat content . ” ; - ) alas and alack , i don ’ t think i have a reason to take a probiotic supplement at this time . if i do find myself with the need in the future , i ’ ll be reviewing this video.interestingly enough , it was my dog who recently needed a probiotic supplement after being on antibiotics . he ate a special probiotic powder made just for dogs for a couple of weeks in addition to his regular meals . i think it ’ s kind of funny that my dog got probiotics in light of darryl ’ s comment about “ dogs : the probiotic for your household . ” ( nice comment darryl ! ) sort of a circular thing at my house.just one more reason to love dogs ! thea no need for supplements , just try some live wild cultured whole foods like cashew or other nondairy cheese , sauerkraut , kimchi , natto , miso , kombucha , mustard , nondairy yogurt , kefir water etc.i am a big fan of cashew cheese made of home-made rejuvalac . i ’ m just super-conscious of how calorie-dense it is . that ’ s a big concern for me . and of course , i couldn ’ t feed that to my dog … also , i have no idea what / which probiotics are actually in the home-made rejuvalac – or if it makes a difference how old the stuff is . one theory i have is that the bad bacteria multiply and take over any good bacteria the longer the rejuvalac has been sitting in my fridge . my theory is that the anerobics are bad and anerobics can take over the longer the liquid is in an air tight container . i don ’ t have any evidence for that.just some thoughts . i eat the cashew cheese for fun / taste , not for need . if i truly needed probiotics for a medical reason , i wouldn ’ t personally rely on any of those whole foods you listed . i would want to take something that is controlled with the correct / needed bacteria . if you have a link to a site showing specific analysis of the probiotics in the foods you mention , i would be interested in seeing that . i ’ m cuirous to know what was found and how much variation there is from product to product and batch to batch.thanks for your thoughts.i had seen something like that in my google scholar alerts but can ’ t find it now , i ’ ll be sure to post it here when it comes up again . btw there are no bad bactria that grow on cultured food , except perhaps mold on the top you can just scrape off – wisteria , e coli , etc are all animal based and are only found on plants that have been comtaminated , i.e. someone pooped on it or put sewage sludge on it.http : / / link.springer.com / article / 10.2478 / s11756-014-0367-7 # page-1 discusses the conversion of exopolysaccharides in probiotic bacteria to prebiotic nutrients for the distal colon bugs , good background write uphttps : / / www.consumerlab.com / reviews / probiotic _ supplements _ lactobacillus _ acidophilus _ bifidobacterium / probiotics / is an apparently good report on probiotic supps but you have to pay to see itdr . greger , i ’ m wondering if you could make a recommendation as to which brand or which bacteria i ’ m supposed to look for ? ( i recently had to take a round of antibiotics for a uti . ) there is a dizzying amount of products on the market , and i ’ m not sure what to look for . do you have a favorite brand ? align is a good product and easy to find . it is packaged so that it does not need to be refrigerated , which makes it good for traveling or bringing to the office to take mid-day , if you prefer.studies have shown the best time to take a probiotic is on an empty stomach before eating , preferably in the morning . but , if you ’ re not feeling better in a week , you may want to double the dose , so you ’ ll be taking it twice a day . this link ( http : / / www.endomune.com / learn / suggested-uses-side-effects ) has some good info about side effects.i work with endomune and i ’ d be happy to help answer any other questions you may have.i have several problems like dandruff , a yeast body odor , and my flatulents really stink . any ideas ? i ’ m vegan and eat very little processed food . it might be because i have low levels of good bacteria in my gut.what are the best sources of probiotics ? i ’ m vegan and need to take probiotics i think.thank you for these videos that answer questions i have a hard time finding answers to ! ! ! if you get any info on brands of probiotics that would b nice ! i ’ ve read about a probiotic called just thrive probiotic that claims 100 % survivability because its in spore form . not sure what that means or how true it is . does anyone know anything about spore probiotics ? how can you test a probiotic to see if it is still alive ? why do i often get diarrhea after taking probiotics ? does that happen to anyone else ? who conducted the study ? joseph , i recall that dr greger said in an earlier video words to the effect that studies show introducing a high load of bacteria to the body ( such as in some food cultures ) can release a wave of endotoxins which cause inflammation throughout the body – and he stopped eating them because of this . is he still of the same mind about this ? dr. greger is very good at updating his videos if something is misrepresented , so you can assume his content is accurate . if it ’ s not and you see a goof he ’ d surely like to know about it ! to try and help answer your question i think the bacteria dr. greger mentioned is very different from probiotics if that is what you are referring to ? here is his video that discuss bacterial endotoxins in food . let me know if this helps and thanks so much for your patience.sincerely , josephi was referring to fermented vegetables . previously , in response to someone ’ s question in the comments section dr greger said he stopped eating kim chi which he eat regularly before the below and another study which i can ’ t find the link to , showed that even fermented vegetables introduce a high load of bacteria to the body and it can release a wave of endotoxins which cause inflammation throughout the body . ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dead-meat-bacteria-endotoxemia / ) – would you ask dr greger whether he still avoids fermented vegetables such as those one can purchase in glass jars in health food outlets ? i understand that its not necessary to eat fermented vegetables to get a healthy microbiome if one is eating well but i would still like to know whether eating fermented vegetables is something to avoid . many thanks ! ahhh , okay , benj here is the video from 2010 on kimchi . if his position has changed from this video i ’ ll let you know ! thanks ! joseph apple juice , colon health , dairy , fat , juice , milk , oatmeal , probiotics , stomach health , supplements , water proper timing of probiotic supplements may improve their survival . what dose should we take and under what circumstances ? see the first video in this series , preventing and treating diarrhea with probiotics . then i compared probiotics to prebiotics in preventing the common cold with probiotics ? , and friday i 'll end on gut feelings : probiotics and mental health.i was surprised to find so few actual data on this topic , but that is par for the course for much advice about dietary supplements . see , for example , this series : vitamin d supplements should also probably be taken with meals for maximum efficacy ( take vitamin d supplements with meals ) .for more context , check out my associated blog posts : probiotics and diarrhea , probiotics during cold season ? , how should i take probiotics ? , and how probiotics affect mental health
PLAIN-2759	breast cancer and alcohol : how much is safe ? recently , the iarc , the international agency for research on cancer , the official world health organization body that decides what is and what is not cancer-causing , concluded that alcoholic beverages--all alcoholic beverages are to be considered carcinogenic to humans.most recent research has focused on acetaldehyde , the first and most toxic alcohol metabolite , as a cancer-causing agent . seems that bacteria in our mouths oxidize alcohol into this carcinogen called acetaldehyde , which we then swallow.there 's convincing evidence that alcohol consumption increases the risk of breast cancer , but most of the data derive from studies that focused on the effect of moderate or high alcohol intakes , while little was known about light alcohol drinking ( up to 1 drink / day ) , hence this new meta-analysis of studies that compared light drinkers to non-drinkers , and found a moderate but significant association with breast cancer , based on the results of more than 100 studies.they estimate that about 5,000 breast cancer deaths a year are attributable to light drinking , meaning nearly 5,000 women that died of breast cancer maybe wouldn 't have if they had stayed away from alcohol completely , leading to an editorial in the medical journal breast that concluded " women who consume alcohol chronically have an increased risk for breast cancer that is dose dependent but without threshold , " meaning there 's apparently no level of alcohol consumption that doesn 't raise breast cancer risk at least a little . so , no safe threshold . any level of alcohol consumption appears to increase the risk of developing an alcohol related cancer.for example , the harvard nurses ’ study found that even consumption of less than a single drink per day may be associated with a modest increase in risk . forget a single drink what about a single sip . a new study found that even holding a teaspoon of hard liquor in your mouth for 5 seconds — and then spitting it out results in carcinogenic concentrations of acetaldehyde produced from the alcohol in the oral cavity instantly after a small sip of strong alcoholic beverage , and the exposure continues for at least 10 min after spitting it out.even alcohol-containing mouthwash can give you a carcinogenic spike . the researchers conclude , " all in all , there is a rather low margin of safety in the use of alcohol-containing mouthwash . typical use will reach the concentration range above which adverse effects are to be expected . until the establishment of a more solid scientific basis for a threshold level of acetaldehyde in saliva , prudent public health policy would recommend generally refraining from using alcohol in such products.so why isn 't the same recommendation made for alcoholic beverages ? well , as the harvard paper concludes " individuals will need to weigh the risks of light to moderate alcohol use on breast cancer development against the benefits for heart disease prevention to make the best personal choice regarding alcohol consumption . they 're talking about the famous j shaped curve . while smoking is bad and more smoking is worse , and exercising is good and more exercise is better , for alcohol there appears to be this beneficial effect of small doses . a six-pack a day raises overall mortality , but so does teetotalling.the # 1 killer of women isn 't breast cancer , it 's heart disease , and a drink a day reduces the risk of heart disease . why just reduce the risk of heart disease , though , when you may nearly eliminate the risk of heart disease with a healthy diet ? so a plant-based diet that excludes certain plant-based beverages may be the best for overall longevity . nice way to wrap it up michaelthanks for sharing what others refuse to share.i wonder what the risk is if your use mouthwash like i do . rinse with mouthwash , spit , light rinse with water , toothpaste , rinse and re-rinse until my mouth does not have any visible paste left . : { } ? what about alcohol based deodorants ? what about social drinking ? my heritage is french , italian , and spanish . needless to say , we are wine drinkers . and for generations , the women in my family have lived well into their 80 ’ s and 90 ’ s . most of us drink moderately , and not hard liquor either , but almost exclusively red wine . however , when we get together for family gatherings , we have been known to polish off a couple of bottles of wine . does this social bonding help protect us against our ‘ bad habit ’ .according to dr. dean ornish , people with strong bonds — friends and family ties — enjoy a bolstered immunity which may protect them from coming down with maladies like cancer and heart disease , which affect the rest of the population eating the same diet ( usually meat-based ) . now , i am a vegan and i have a healthy life style overall , but i do enjoy an occasional glass of wine . and i don ’ t have any of the risk factors that are associated with developing cancer . what is wrong with women enjoying an occassional glass of wine ? i have to say , i often wonder if some of these studies targeted at women aren ’ t motivated by a puritanical bias on the part of the researchers . i suppose we ’ ll hear next that men may still drink moderately , but if you ’ re a women , you ’ d better not take so much as a sip . look , i know that many of these studies are not fool-proof . researchers may be affected by unconscious biases towards certain groups ( e.g. women drinkers ) . and the results may be skewed . so i have some questions . did they take a healthy vegan lifestyle into consideration , or were they looking mainly at meat eaters ? this is still a puritanical society when it comes to what women can or can ’ t do . well , perhaps i ’ m just rationalizing . i do like my wine . all the same , i ’ d like to see more studies before i accept these results . i don ’ t see anything wrong with an occasional glass of wine enjoyed among friends.a lot of problems , which affect both genders , are associated with alcohol consumption – of course some of them dose dependent : violence ( probably mostly men ) , car accidents , hypertension , stroke , colorectalcancer , diabetes , osteoporosis , atrial fibrillation , heart failure etc . the true safe upper limit for both genders is probably low . that said , i drink wine every week , and i have no intention of stopping that . and you make a good point , you eat healthy , it is a part of social life , social bonding , eating well , it makes you relax , it tastes great – and hey its plant based ! : - ) for perspective , breast cancer accounts for only 3.3 out of 100 deaths among american women . cardiovascular diseases accounted for 10 fold the number of deaths . ( http : / / www.cdc.gov / nchs / data / dvs / deaths _ 2010 _ release.pdf ) i think these two papers are worth perusing : sun , qi , et al . “ alcohol consumption at midlife and successful ageing in women : a prospective cohort analysis in the nurses ’ health study . ” plos medicine 8.9 ( 2011 ) : e1001090. http : / / www.plosmedicine.org / article / info % 3adoi % 2f10.1371 % 2fjournal.pmed.1001090women who drank moderately ( and even daily ) had a better chance of living to 70 without a medical history of serious diseases ( cancer , diabetes , cardiovascular disease and stroke , parkinson ’ s , ms , etc . ) , loss of cognitive function , disability , or mental illness . this measure aggregates a whole range of potential health setbacks.and on the other side : britton , a. , m. g. marmot , and m. shipley . “ who benefits most from the cardioprotective properties of alcohol consumption — health freaks or couch potatoes ? . ” j epidemiol commun h 62.10 ( 2008 ) : 905-908. http : / / jech.bmj.com / content / 62 / 10 / 905.shortphysically active non-smoking women with healthy diets didn ’ t get the heart / stroke risk benefit from alcohol seen in the general population.i have started to have some tooth problems and i started to swish with salt water instead of the alcohol based mouthwash . i find the salt water is far more soothing than the alcohol based mouthwash , which is very irritating . is salt water the best thing to swish one ’ s mouth with ? i do use sea salt and of course don ’ t drink the salt water.the best thing to swish is organic coconut oilthanks , and what i found on the web about “ oil pulling ” which i think you are referring to is very interesting.hello , what about kefir ? when you leave it several days it generates a little of alcohol , may be less than 1 % but it ’ s alcoholi heard dr. oz recommend a glass of beer per day as being beneficial . i think that was irresponsible . some don ’ t want to stop at one glass . and with the information in this video , it would be best to avoid all alcohol and go plant-based.how about grape juice ? i wonder if this casts a totally different light on the use of alcohol based herbal tinctures . what do you think ? how bad it is if i am using listerine day and night , every day ? and is it possible that it effects the liver ? the teetotalers in the studies showing the j shaped curve may have been people who had a history of alcohol dependence . they also may have been abstaining because of other health problems such as liver disease . they need to re-do those studies , excluding those with a history of alcohol related diseases , and controlling adequately for other health-related behaviors.so what about alcohol in herbal tinctures ? acetaldehyde , alcohol , beverages , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , cancer , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , exercise , harvard nurses ' health study , heart disease , heart health , lifespan , longevity , mortality , mouthwash , oral cancer , oral health , plant-based diets , safety limits , smoking , vegans , vegetarians , women 's health , world health organization nearly 5,000 breast cancer deaths a year may be attributable to just light drinking ( up to one drink a day ) . previously i 've addressed the pros and cons in alcohol risks vs. benefits . the other mouthwash video i referred to is don ’ t use antiseptic mouthwash , part of a video series on improving athletic performance with nitrate-containing vegetables ( if interested , start here : doping with beet juice ) .as you can see in my volume 13 dvd listing , i 've got another video coming up in a few weeks , breast cancer risk : red wine vs. white wine . make sure you 're subscribed ( for free ! ) so you don 't miss it.how else might one reduce breast cancer risk ? see , for example : or any of my 75 videos on breast cancer .
PLAIN-2769	the mcgovern report george mcgovern , who died last year age 90 , was best known for his 1972 presidential defeat to richard nixon , be he also chaired a committee that released the first dietary guidelines in january 1977 . " the simple fact is , he said at the press conference of their release , " that our diets have changed radically with the last 50 years with very harmful effects on our health . these dietary changes represent as great a threat to public health as smoking . " " the diet of the american people has become increasingly rich – rich in meat and other sources of saturated fat and cholesterol and sugar . " " most all of the health problems underlying the leading causes of death in the united states could be modified by improvements in diet . " " ischemic heart disease , cancer , diabetes , and hypertension are the diseases that kill us . they are epidemic in our population . we cannot afford to temporize . the public wants some guidance , wants to know the truth , and hopefully today we can lay the cornerstone for the building of better health for all americans through better nutrition . " as dr. hegsted later recounted in an interview--a founding member of harvard 's nutrition department that spoke at the press conference — " the meat , milk and egg producers were very upset . " and they weren 't the only ones . the president of the international sugar research foundation called the report “ unfortunate and ill-advised , " all part of the emotional anti-sucrose , anti-table sugar tidal wave conspiracy evidently . from the official record : " simply stated , people like sweet things , and apparently the mcgovern committee believes that people should be deprived of what they like . there is a puritanical streak in certain americans that leads them to become ‘ do-gooders . ’ " the president of the salt institute felt that there is definitely no need for a dietary goal that calls for the reduction of salt consumption . in fact the assertion that " improved nutrition may cut the nation 's health bill by one third " was challenged . see , what you don 't understand is that healthcare expenditures increase if the lifespan is prolonged . see if people live longer because they eat healthier it could be more expensive . as some researcher pointed out , " if tobacco were banned the increase in the expected lifespan would simultaneously increase the cost of care of old people which comes under the category of healthcare expenditures . " if people eat healthier we might have more old people to take care of ! the national dairy council likewise recommended the dietary goals be withdrawn and reformulated to have the endorsement of the food industry . you know as soon as haagen das says their ok , then go for it.the two industries that went most ballistic , though , were the meat and egg producers who demanded additional hearings be held . the president of the american national cattlemen 's association described why the industry " reacted rather violently , " complaining that meat is never mentioned in a positive way in the guidelines . the only mentions of meat were those associating meat consumption with various degenerative diseases . " if these dietary goals are moved forward and promoted in the present form … entire sectors of the food industry ( meat , dairy , sugar , and others ) may be so severely damage that when it is realized that the dietary guidelines advised as surely will be the discovery production recovery may be out of reach . ” " thus guided by my conscience , ” said the president of the national livestock and meat board , “ i am certain that actions of the animal industries to ensure americans are properly fed with abundant meat and other animal foods is an honorable and morally correct diet course . " the meat industry recommended the committee withdraw the dietary guidelines and issue a corrected report . they especially didn 't like guideline # 2 to decrease meat consumption to lower saturated fat intake . senator dole — kansas senator dole offered to have that amended from decrease consumption of meat to instead " increase consumption of lean meat . " “ would that taste better to you ? ” he asked the president of the cattlemen 's association , who replied , “ decrease is a bad word , senator " . by the end of the year , a revised version was released ; guideline 2 was changed to " choose meats , poultry , and fish which will reduce saturated fat intake . " that wasn 't enough for the meat industry . they wanted the whole committee on nutrition to be eliminated completely and its functions turned over to the agriculture committee . the new york times , noting that the agriculture committee looks after the producers of food , editorialized that this would be like " sending the chickens off to live with the foxes , " and that 's what happened . the senate committee on nutrition and human needs got disbanded and placed within the senate committee on agriculture , nutrition , and forestry . mcgovern , though , never gave up the fight . when an interviewer confronted him with the serenity prayer 's " grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change , " mcgovern rejected the notion , saying : " i keep trying to change them . " thanks dr. greger ! love the video ! one of the reasons i started changing my diet 4 years ago was because of the knowledge i gained about the food industry / politics from reading michael pollan ’ s books . not that i agree with his “ grass fed beef is ok ” mentality anymore but the history lesson was enraging . i felt so suckered by corporations . however , i realized we all have a choice of what ’ s on our forks . of course dr. greger and forks over knives are the main reasons i ’ m vegan today . this is one of your best videos yet . thank you . “ all truth passes through three stages . first , it is ridiculed . second , it is violently opposed . third , it is accepted as being self-evident . ” arthur schopenhauer , german philosopher , 1788-1860.the truth is out ! ( and has been for 35 years ) where the f … is the info to the general public … . michael , you are the best.how long is it supposed to take to get to stage three ? ? this video explains why our government fails to advocate proper nutrition for the country : special interests control our government . dr. greger , you have hit a home run ! right ! a friend of mine living in japan complained that she can ’ t find flax seeds anywhere . i looked into it and found out that the japanese government had banned the importation of flax seeds because they tested them and found them to be genetically modified ( she can still get chia seeds ) . japan and most european governments exercise the precautionary principle to gaurd the health of their people . here in the us , our government uses the “ prevarication principle ” to gaurd the health of corporate profits . i ’ m wondering if it may not be time to move.i have been to korea and japan . their food is healthy but not all of it is guarding the health of their people lol . everything has msg and many snacks have aspartame.unfortunatelly , the score is still industry : 1000 , public : 0i haven ’ t been able to locate an online , full-text version of the 1st edition report from 1977 . can anyone point me to it ? thanks ! i believe this is it ( page scans only ) : http : / / babel.hathitrust.org / cgi / pt ? id = uiug.30112023368936beautifully done ! thanks for an excellent history lesson.this is a great example of how our governments are failing us . we work , we pay taxes , and ( generally ) we are getting sicker . we work , we pay taxes , and they lie to us ( fails to tell the truth ) . we work , we pay taxes , and the government fails to protect us.if mcgovern had emphasized eating more meals composed of only fresh fruits and vegetables instead of demonizing other foods , he might ﻿ have bypassed the whole debate . the other industries would have been forced to argue that we eat less fruits and vegetables.fascinating and disturbing at the same time.thank you for exposing the truth behind the politics.thank you for the excellent information ! thanks for this article dr. greger . its a good reminder of the usa ’ s degradation of governance . at some point , hopefully soon , according to strauss and howe of “ the fourth turning ” , this corrupt institution , which relies on financial support from major moneyed interests , will fail , and be replaced by a system that has an effective firewall against moneyed influence . i do wonder though , how that will come about … as it will likely be over the dead bodies of so many institutions and lobbyists who currently control our government.that was then , thank you . who has risen to the challenge ? to whom do we turn to lend our support in congress ? who to fight ? we are the converted . doesn ’ t this topic deserve a blog of its own ? become preachers : some of us believe meat is murder , the science says it is suicide . whatever your style , in-your-face or softly-softly , push the topic. force the issue. you may loose a “ friend ” or two .. but together we must grass-roots this thing across the planet to grease political change … we can live with.great video , once again the health of a nation was decided by industries that make their money without caring about the consequences of their actions.goverments first aim is to think about the health of their people , not the health of some “ biased ” industries … thanks dr greger ! ! i find this information fascinating . i also find it helpful in backing up something that i have been trying to explain to people – that the really big picture of what we know about healthy eating has not changed for decades . some of the nuances have changed and will continue to change . but the over-all diet that equals healthy has been known for a long time.compare that will all the confusing nutritional controversy you hear on the news all the time . american media anyway continues to do humans a huge disservice . i often wonder , if the american media did their job , would the government be able to get away with their misdeeds ? thanks again dr. greger for an awesome video . i ’ m looking forward to the new volume.this is one of your very best ; reaches deep into the power relationships that determine whether we live longer and healthier or die sick and not yet old . those interested should see colin campbell ’ s recollection of this moment in our government ’ s collusion with the livestock industry ’ s manipulation of truth , its abrogation of its regulatory function that is intended to keep us safe . see also david servan schreiber ’ s memoir for mcgovern ’ s assessment of the disastrous effect that his report and his refusal to repudiate it had on his political career . the agri industry is playing for very high stakes ; we discount that fact at our peril.bravo dr. greger ! thank you for educating the public on how we have been bamboozled and sold out by our federal government and the food industry . it is a true samson and goliath fight but our grass roots movement has taken hold and we will never ever give up on sharing the truth about how the villainous foods ; animal protein , dairy and oil guarantee a life filled with disease and ailments . cheers to the healing powers of falling in love with delicious foods that love us back ! ! the food politics is very similar in canada , with a lobbyist registry . i don ’ t know that the registry has helped the animal rights movement , but it is at least a glimmer into the lobbying activity of various meat , milk , and egg industries in canada . we as consumers , can play a much bigger role in publishing data from food inspectors , lobbying politicians , and so on . it may not tip the balance , but we may save a lot of lives by working together on specific ag issues.while fruits and vegetable help promote health , why is gerson therapy not working base on the study by nci ? great video . just one thing i don ’ t understand : why does it say it ’ s the first u.s. dietary guidelines ? the wikipedia page shows there has been a few before 1977 : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / history _ of _ usda _ nutrition _ guidesthis was the first to be put out by the gov ’ t for the american people that suggested they change the way they traditionally ate that lead them to be way healthier than we are today.the tobacco industry was sued for knowingly selling a product that caused cancer … basically misleading their customers . can a similar lawsuit be brought against the fda ? a fantastic piece ! ! ! i think this should be broadcast on the nightly news – every week ! thank you dr. greger , for this excellent video ! great to understand the history and politics behind nutrition guidelines.i wonder what our heath costs would have looked like if we had been able to take a strong public health initiative to truly improve our diet , instead of the compromised watered down version we have to contend with . it would have been such a great investment ! getting the correct unbiased , evidence-based information out there is the next best thing , because more and more people are demanding healthier nutrition as they discover the benefits.thanks for your contribution to this information … .it is invaluable ! evidence-based and this website do not go togetheryap all you want , mr. corporate shill , ,, you ’ re either that or a dumb sonovabitch that is so insecure you ’ d rather be ‘ right ’ than healthy . you ain ’ t right , nor do you have the brains to read a study … i still vote for ‘ being paid by the evil tower of big business where you concoct lies to spew out.you do realize this report was spear headed by a vegan , and the report is why so many american fear real animal fats from eggs and beef , which is absurd.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = xbfqc2kxm9cthis little video is interesting enough , i suppose . still , it has done nothing to sway my opinions . yup , public policy involves a lot of politicking . nothing shocking or revelatory there.eggs and beef have never been the problem folks , and never will … don ’ t blame old foods for new disease … sugar , white flour , vegetable oils and many other processed foods yes , real foods like eggs / beef , c ’ mon get realare you kidding ? have a look at the the swathes of research detailed on this site that say exactly that : yes , beef and eggs are a problem ! in his “ trends in food availability ” study , dr. barnard has pointed out : “ over the following century , annual per capita meat consumption soared from 123.9 pounds in 1909 to over 200 pounds in 2004 . in the same interval , annual cheese intake rose from less than 4 pounds per person to well over 30 pounds . that extra 75 pounds or so of meat and 30 pounds of cheese — per person per year — have contributed a load of fat , cholesterol , and calories that are joined by more calories from sugar , the intake of which has surged as well . ” sure , sugar , processed grains , and oils are not healthy , but plenty of empirical research ( in fact , the balance of the scientific research ) bears out that beef and eggs are not health food and that plant-based diets are the way to eat for long-term health.keep watching and reading this site to learn more about what current empirical peer-reviewed science has to say on the topic of nutrition and health.i have posted this before and ill post it again so we can view what the science says about eggs.eggs are considered good sources of lutein and omega 3 as well as an excellent source of protein . for these reasons , they are considered health foods . looking at these claims in detail , chickens have lutein due to the fact that they have a varietized feed , these nutrients are not inherent of eggs . based on the nutrient data found on the usda database , 10 grams of spinach has approximately 12 times more lutein then 10 grams of an egg . we cannot really consider eggs an appropriate source of this nutrient.https : / / www.ars.usda.gov / sp2userfiles / place / 12354500 / data / sr25 / nutrlist / sr25a338.pdfregarding omega 3 , current levels of omega 3 in eggs are highly inadequate and one must consume around 30 eggs to reach an acceptable level of omega 3 for the day . a male needs around 1.6 grams of omega 3 per day , a female needs around 1.1 grams a day . a large egg contains about .037 grams of omega 3 . omega 3 in the ala form processes to epa which is also processed to dha . these fats are anti-inflammatory . omega 6 processes down to arachadonic acid which is highly inflammatory . according to the national cancer institute , eggs are the number 2 top contributor of arachidonic acid in the american diet.http : / / riskfactor.cancer.gov / diet / foodsources / fatty _ acids / table4.htmlbased on this as well as the low omega 3 content of eggs , the benefits received from omega 3 are masked by the high quantity of preformed arachidonic acid . high intake of arachadonic acid is linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , ulcerative colitis , as well as a clear link with cancer development.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed ?

you have done such a fabulous job ( far better than i could ever ) . however , let me sit and ponder it , i may actually throw myself into the fray.thanks for the compliment , and yes , futile indeed . all i can hope is that i made them stop and briefly rethink what they advocate . its shocking really how many paleo dieters came to comment.you are most welcome . yes , they are commenting more often than they used to , and probably will continue to do so in ever greater numbers . so , i have decided to pick my battles b / c frankly , at this point , i find these “ debates ” exhausting . it ’ s like arguing with folks who don ’ t think global warming is an issue or who think that the earth really was created in 7 days.but , that is part of the problem isn ’ t it ? thinking , that is . i love the internet and the availability of information on it . sadly , i fear that most people accessing it do not know how to think critically , let alone discuss issues in an intelligent way . hence , the intense exchanges , the internet trolls , all the conspiracy theories on all sorts of topics . to me it screams the need for better access to quality education and specifically to learning how “ to know ” , understand , and critique all sorts of information . a daunting task , indeed . however , i have faith that it is not an impossible task ( ok , to be honest , sometimes i lose faith in this thought ) .it saddens and angers me that certain “ experts ” – some of them with prestigious titles and credentials — know this is the dynamic at play and choose to prey on these folks because it makes them richer . meanwhile , public health suffers . ( one of the reasons i admire dr. g so , is that he does not make a profit off the work he does on behalf of public health . ) oy , i guess i went off on a bit a tangent . really though , you handled yourself beautifully . you deserve a golden carrot.indeed , the standard for evidence is so low for these people and they have no interest in investigating what they are saying . one of the prominent posters literally told me that there were so many nutrients in grass fed butter that there was no room to list hem all . i promptly checked the nutritiondata database and found quite the opposite , it was empty calories , as all free fats are . some vitamin a to maintain freshness but that ’ s about it.http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / custom / 2244512 / 2i am sure that this person read that grass fed butter was rich in nutrients and had no interest in finding out for themselves if this was really true . this mindset is exhibited by all of them and i am sure a prominent figure has given them this information . i agree with you , it is quite disturbing when someone like that purposefully misconstrues the data or shows misleading studies to promote their claims.seems like these folks are simply cuckoo for coconut oil . so be it.i have reached the point if people want to guzzle gallons of coconut oil for so-called health benefits , let them . i will continue to eat in a way that makes sense nutritionally , environmentally , ethically , and , yes , scientifically , as best and as often as i can.your efforts have been noble and tireless . ( i read the butter exchange ) . really , how do you find the energy and motivation to continue ? my motivation comes from the fact that people may read the posts and come to a health decision based on these posts . i want to make sure that everything is covered , so i continue the debate to the point where they have exhausted their supply of usually flawed or misconstrued arguments and data . at the point that they begin going in circles with me i usually stop the debate , and leave it to the hopefully neutral readers to decide who ’ s argument is more solid and what advice they should take from it.these debates also get me to look up information which furthers my own knowledge.well , you have worked your magic on me . i probably am not a neutral reader anymore , but i was at one point . and , your arguments and style have won me over.keep on keeping on ! as you point out correctly , there is indeed a lot of vegan propaganda on the web . that being said , a credible argument can be made for shifting in the direction of eating more plant products over animal products.the argument goes that plant products have much higher density of essential nutrients and antioxidants than animal products . plant products also have a far lower concentration of toxins than animal products . common concerns on nutrient sufficiency of vegetarian diets are authoritatively answered by the academy of nutrition and dieticians , who argue that properly planned vegan and vegetarian diets are healthful at all stages of the life cycle . follow the link below for details : http : / / www.eatright.org / about / content.aspx ? id = 8357keeping this argument in mind , dr. greger does provide some useful supplementary material for those interested in vegetarianism.best of luck with your dietary experimentation ! usda and fda advice is unreliable , according to william harris http : / / treegrower.org / health / cal % 20presents.htmlthanks so much this is changing my life and my families . i don ’ t know if its possible but would love to share and swap healthy recipes with your audience.patti : i agree , this information * is * life changing . you are not alone.concerning healthy recipes : some of us do share recipes from time to time on this site , especially in context of a video / topic . however , there isn ’ t ( yet ? ) a specific place on this site for doing so in any sort of significant way.i know that there are several good , free blogs where people post healthy vegan recipe ideas . but they aren ’ t so much about swapping recipes as sharing ideas from a particular person . if you are most interested in getting some good ideas for healthy eating , i ’ ll share my favorites with you : 1 ) the ( free ) on-line 21 day kickstart program – where you can get 21 day ’ s worth of meal plans , including recipes from a very well researched group that gets results.2 ) my favorite cookbooks : let them eat vegan everyday happy herbivoregreat vegetarian cooking under pressure vegan on the cheapjust straight microwave or saute with water instead of oil when called for in the recipe and you are golder.best of luck to you.thanks dr. greger.i was curious if you have done any videos on farm subsidies.there is a lot of articles on the internet that suggest that a lot of taxpayer money goes to producing feed for farm animals . but i don ’ t know anything about politics . i am curious if there is any truth to this ? the government should have no more role advising people on what to eat than advising them on what religion to practice . when you give that kind of power to the government , don ’ t be surprised when special interests determine the result , whether it ’ s what kind of food we must buy or what kind of health insurance we must purchase . the solution : get the state out of the health care business entirely . we need a separation of health and state for the same reason as a separation of church and state.what a fantastic and informative video the comments below are also important to read . thank you , dr. greger and toxins and almost all for your contributions ! elected representatives of the people , hahaha , ,, , and big business donations , equal ‘ let the people eat poison , it pays better ’ .great one ! corporations have lobbyists with deep pockets . the american people have no lobbyists to protect their interests . it ’ s not fair.your just wierdspamspamspamspamspamspamspamspamspamthere are 3 goals in mind : 1 ) moneyed interests protecting profits 2 ) bought politicians protecting future political campaign contributions 3 ) ideologues who exercise confirmation bias and refuse ( i mean absolutely refuse ) to objectively consider anything nutritional science says that challenges what they do .

PLAIN-2779	raisins vs. jelly beans for athletic performance after about an hour of strenuous exercise , long-distance athletes can really start to deplete their glycogen stores , the body 's source of quick energy . studies dating back to the 30 's found that by hooking athletes on a treadmill up to an iv drip of sugar water , you could delay fatigue , and that drinking sugar water could help as well . so the sports supplement industry has come up with an array of energy shots , gels , bars , and chews — even sports jelly beans , used , what a coincidence , by the jelly belly cycling team . in fact the jelly belly candy company paid for a study that found that said jellybeans could shave 4 or 5 seconds off of a 10km cycling trial compared to sports drinks or gels . but what about compared to raisins ? given that professional , collegiate , and recreational sporting events are supplement centered and heavily marketed to , athletes at all levels may be left with the impression that ‘ ‘ specially designed ’ ’ supplements are essential for optimal performance . yet , these products are often expensive and cheaper , natural foods that may provide a healthier alternative are often overlooked . there are low-cost , natural food products rich in carbs , such as sun-dried raisins that have the potential to improve performance to a similar degree . raisins are nutritious , convenient , typically palatable , and are a cost-effective source of concentrated carbohydrates . but do they work as well ? they work exactly as well . same time , same power output . same thing comparing raisins to a commercial sports gels--same respiratory exchange , carb and fat oxidation , and energy expenditure . in fact the only significant difference was that in " hedonic scores " pleasantness scoring of raisins beat out the jelly beans . versus jelly beans with flavors like extreme watermelon there was a greater preference for just raisin flavored raisins . dr. greger , do you have any thoughts on people with lupus avoiding garlic because it can rev-up the immune system , which can be detrimental with those having autoimmune diseases such as lupus . the johns hopkins lupus center has a list of “ things to avoid ” if you have lupus ( garlic being one of them ) . they also suggest avoiding alfalfa sprouts . garlic is highly touted by many vegans but i think it is prudent to address this issue on your site as there are quite a few here that deal with autoimmune diseases such as lupus . one can still receive the benefits of a plant-based diet without ingesting garlic.interesting predicament . i ’ m also very interested in the answer . thanks for bringing it up.yes , indeed . maybe folks end up on a plant based diet because it seems to help lessen some of the symptoms of autoimmune diseases . a piece of advice i have often encountered is that one with autoimmune deficiencies / diseases should consider abstaining from anything that can either heighten , enhance , and or stimulate the immune system . this is the reason many folks claim to avoid mushrooms , chlorella , bee pollen , garlic and onions , echinacea … .. i don ’ t know the true answer to all this , as some of these just mentioned substances can be beneficial for people , but this just might be for people with normal , balanced immune systems.can anyone tell me where to ask a question on this site ? i ’ m new to being a vegan , started a couple months ago and i ’ m gaining weight ! i don ’ t eat junk food , it ’ s frustrating ! help ! you may want to reduce the starch components in your diets like potatoes , pasta , grains , noodles and especially sugary foods . and increase non starchy veggies like kale , brussels sprouts , brocolli , spinach etc . 1 lb of fat is ~ 3500 calories , so if you can cut at least 500 calories per day theoretically you can shed ~ 1 lb fat in a week . be persistent and consistent and good luck ! ! thank you for your input ! ! good words by the other people who have replied to you . personally , i eat a whole lot of potatoes , grains , and legumes , and i won ’ t gain weight at all . maybe you ’ re different . however , for sure avoiding processed foods ( even veggie burgers ) would only help ; save your “ junk food points ” only for “ emergencies ” . i eat all the whole foods i want and won ’ t gain weight . i do gain a bit of a belly when i get on a junk food roll , which goes away real quick when i get back on the whole foods track.keep consuming the whole foods , which includes the awesomes like kale and other darker greens . you can eat wholefoods until you ’ re full so please don ’ t calorie restrict ; that would be a huge mistake . i really can ’ t imagine too many people gaining weight eating plant-based whole foods.exercise burns calories and builds strength . i ’ d recommend high intensity workouts three times a week . i ’ d check out funk roberts mma and start with spartan metabolic workout week 1 . if you really don ’ t want to exercise , then you should still lose weight , but i really think you should exercise.oh , one more thing : vegans should supplement b12 . don ’ t worry about it not being “ natural ” ; the world has changed and we must adapt . look up b12 on this site and learn more . be mindful of dogmatic vegans who speak in absolutes . best wishes.i also eat plenty of grains , and they seem to have a minimal effect on my weight . how concentrated the grain is can make a difference though , e.g. grain flour in the form of bread compared to eating the actual wheat berries , rice , oats , buckwheat groats , millet , etc . for someone who ’ s tried everything else first to lose weight i might suggest looking into that.and although i eat as many grains as i want , the focus or priority of the meal is always veggies . i tend to fill up on the veggie “ sides ” , then move on to the grain and bean based part of the meal.i ’ d also reiterate what you said about never restricting ! my personal philosophy is that if you have to restrict what you ’ re eating , you ’ re eating the wrong foods ! what other animal ever tries to limit its food intake ? all i ever think about is if i ’ m getting enough calories during the day . it feels like a much more natural way to live.also i just wanted to clarify this since sally ’ s new to this stuff , that veggie burgers are super duper great ! just make them yourself . : ) thanks so much for all the great input . i do make homemade vegi burgers . i do eat a lot of oats. does anyone think that may be a problem . i eat either steel cut oats or a homemade granola ( oats , seeds , nuts , aagave , coconut ) for breakfast and sometime i have the granola for a snack . i have a vegi sandwich on daves killer whole wheat bread for lunch and usually a salad and bean soup or pasta for dinner . carrots , almonds , raisins , oranges for snacks. my husband went vegan only a few days a week and of course lost 4 pounds and i gained 2 . i just thought i would lose weight.sally – in a word – yes . grains are very calorie dense as is the agave you use in the granola . agave is very very high in fructose which is not favorable for health or losing weight . nuts and seeds are wonderful foods but they ’ re not good for weight loss so you may want to limit those to 1 / 2 oz daily or no more than 1 oz . the bread is also calorie dense as is dried fruit like raisins . you can lose weight by centering your diet around vegetables which are naturally low in calories and the healthiest foods on the planet . check out dr. fuhrman ’ s 6 week plan . the salad is the main dish so you could ditch the bread and crumble a home made veggie burger on your big salad for lunch ! good luck ! ji , most resources cite 3,500 cal / pound of fat . but have you ever done the math ? 9 cal / gram times 454 grams in a pound = 4,086 cal / lb of fat . my explanation is that the 3,500 number is for a pound of fat tissue which contains water and other non-caloric matter . but since when we lose weight , we are draining fat from cells rather than removing chunks of tissue , i believe the 4,000 figure is more accurate.still , your sugestion of a deficit of 500 calories a day is good advice.dr. greger does regularly take questions from the comments sections and put them in the q & a section , so perhaps he will see this one ! if i could throw in my two cents , i would suggest looking into a few resources : 1 . dr. doug lisle has a fantastic presentation called “ how to lose weight without losing your mind ” . it ’ s an hour long , on youtube . highly recommend.2. dr. neal barnard offers a slew of books as well as the pcrm website , which offers a 21 day kickstart complete with menus and recipes.3. the healthy librarian has a great blog and some great pointers when it comes to weight loss / maintenance3 . happy herbivore and fatfreevegan are both online blogs with great recipes . happy herbivore also offers weekly menus / shopping lists for a small fee.what you ’ ll see that they all have in common is a two pronged approach . the first is to do away with animal products . you already have that part done ! the second part is doing away with oil / oily foods . a teaspoon of oil here or there may not seem like a big deal , but it can make all the difference with weight loss.my personal story : upon going vegan i didn ’ t lose any weight , but after going oil-free , mostly out of curiosity , i lost 15 lbs in maybe a month and a half or two . i don ’ t know exactly because i actually didn ’ t realize i had any weight to lose and i wasn ’ t really paying attention . one day i just noticed . after that my weight was what it was basically in high school and the weight loss stopped . and i don ’ t feel like i really changed anything . you don ’ t even notice the lack of oil , but then when you do eat some in a restaurant or something , holy moly ! the oil will have a really strong and kind of unpleasant taste.hope that these resources help you out ! all the best.thank you so much for the information ! ! i ’ m going to look up that info and will try cutting out oil . i don ’ t think i use much oil but i ’ ll focus on it now. greatly appreciate the info ! ! ! i really hope these help you enjoy checking these out ! other authors you might look into include rip & caldwell esselstyn , jeff novick , joel fuhrman , and bryanna clark grogan . my personal favorite cookbook right now is vegetarian cooking under pressure by lorna sass . it is actually vegan . it uses a pressure cooker , which i had never used before , but am now obsessed with ! also if you happen to like indian food , i only recently realized that in addition to the regular pcrm 21-day kickstart , they also have an indian version ! lots of recipes , a meal plan , and cooking videos.i ’ m going on and on , but i get so excited about food ! when people wonder what i eat , i just think , there will not be enough days in my lifetime to try all the vegan recipes i want to try ! congratulations on your journey so far and good luck ! re : vegetarian cooking under pressure i love that one too ! the garlic lover ’ s lentil soup and thai chickpeas are the bomb aren ’ t they ! what are your favorites ? : ) b00mer : concerning recipes from lorna sass ’ s book : re : thai chickpeas . amen ! i ’ ve brought that dish to several potlucks , served next to a bowl of quinoa that people could ladle them over – and they were big hits.i ’ ve not yet tried the garlic lover ’ s lentil soup , but now i ’ m going to.my current favorite is the chickpea stew with sweet onions . i ’ ve made it many times now with many variations . for example , if you want it to cook faster , just use a smaller bean . i ’ ve also had fun experimenting with the spices . and i ’ ve added other ingredients , such as mushrooms . i ’ ve replaced the red onions with fresh fennel bulbs . etc . basically , i ’ ve twisted it so many different ways that it doesn ’ t really resemble the original in some of my experiments . but that just means to me that the recipe is an awesome base to start with that lends itself to a lot of creativity so that you don ’ t get bored.if you are ever looking for dessert , her bread-pudding things ( i can ’ t remember exactly what she calls them ) at the back are really yummy and big hits with company.thea : thanks for the suggestion ! i ’ ll try the chickpea stew next . you just made next week ’ s menu planning that much easier . : ) definitely make the lentil soup ! and be sure to roast those peppers . it comes out quite thick and thickens further overnight . i serve it over rice but over quinoa if you prefer would be great as well.thanks so much for all the great input . i do make homemade vegi burgers . i do eat a lot of oats. does anyone think that may be a problem . i eat either steel cut oats or a homemade granola ( oats , seeds , nuts , aagave , coconut ) for breakfast and sometime i have the granola for a snack . i have a vegi sandwich on daves killer whole wheat bread for lunch and usually a salad and bean soup or pasta for dinner . carrots , almonds , raisins , oranges for snacks. my husband went vegan only a few days a week and of course lost 4 pounds and i gained 3 . i just thought i would lose weight.i don ’ t think oats would be a problem , they are pretty hard to overeat . however the nuts , seeds , and coconut are all more calorically dense and are a lot easier to overeat . that ’ s kind the gauge that i use . if you can overeat it , well , you can overeat it ! best to either avoid or pay close attention to it . oats , pasta , beans , veggies , these are all low caloric density foods that your hypothalamus can more easily register and tell you when you ’ re genuinely full . our bodies have a harder time figuring out this stopping point when the foods are more calorically dense.i know personally that i could eat an entire bag of cashews or pistachios and not even feel full . for this reason i avoid snacking on them . i do however use nuts in a more intentional and controlled manner when cooking . some chopped peanuts added to pad thai , or slivered almonds as a garnish on a white bean tomato quinoa pilaf . when combined with all the veggies , beans , and grains , it is impossible to overeat the nuts themselves.in addition i eat flax and chia every morning as part of my oatmeal . but again , mixed into oatmeal , i know that i won ’ t overeat them.of course this is if you are trying to lose weight ( which you said you are ) . for people who actually need to gain / maintain weight , or ironman competitors , foods like nuts , seeds , and coconut may be perfect . so don ’ t get caught up in one expert saying nuts are great , another saying they ’ re bad ; try giving up nuts , seeds , coconut , or whatever for yourself and see what happens.i really like dr furhrman as well . he does a great job getting someone started in the right direction . his book eat for health will be helpful for you . he is all about eating your greens.i want to know the answer to this also . i wonder what is new for diabetic neuropathy ? i understand that the german ’ s treat it with lipoic acid , vitamin d , and etc , and it is highly effective. thanks for your answer . elizabeth in ny ~ after seeing this video i tried creating a raisin-based sports gel ( raisins and water ) that would match the carbs-per-gulp of commercial sports gels . gag ! it is way too sweet.the goal of sports gels is to get fast absorbing carbs into the body of endurance athletes . most endurance athletes require low sweetness for palatability . that is why most sports drinks and gels use maltodextrin as the primary ingredient . matodextrin has about the same fast absorbing glycemic index score as glucose but a much lower level of sweetness . raisins are the opposite . carbs from raisins are 50 % frucose which are both slower absorbing and much higher in sweetness than glucose.when it comes to healty nutrition , grapes and raisins are the way to go . but the makers of sports drinks and gels know what they are doing for their market too.plenty of very high level endurance athletes , including ironman , use dates over sports gel and doing fine. the makers of sports drinks sure know what they are doing for their market , money.hi steve , i try and stay away from any sports products because they are so nasty . have you tried just raisins ? or dates ? also for long runs i like coconut water . also a fruit smoothy before a long run is amazing . none of the intestinal issues and plenty on board energy that lasts.i tried making a raisin “ gel ” which was too sweet to gag down . i ’ ll try straight raisins with a gulp of water and see how things go . how many raisins do you eat at a pop and how often ? thanks for the encouragement.no ! no .. no ! gels are much more nutritional than f … ing raisins because they contain an artificial flavoring , like the kind found in a burger king strawberry milk shake , containing the following ingredients : amyl acetate , amyl butyrate , amyl valerate , anethol , anisyl formate , benzyl acetate , benzyl isobutyrate , butyric acid , cinnamyl isobutyrate , cinnamyl valerate , cognac essential oil , diacetyl , dipropyl ketone , ethyl acetate , ethyl amyl ketone , ethyl butyrate , ethyl cinnamate , ethyl heptanoate , ethyl heptylate , ethyl lactate , ethyl methylphenylglycidate , ethyl nitrate , ethyl propionate , ethyl valerate , heliotropin , hydroxyphenyl-2-butanone ( 10 percent solution in alcohol ) , a-ionone , isobutyl anthranilate , isobutyl butyrate , lemon essential oil , maltol , 4-methylacetophenone , methyl anthranilate , methyl benzoate , methyl cinnamate , methyl heptine carbonate , methyl naphthyl ketone , methyl salicylate , mint essential oil , neroli essential oil , nerolin , neryl isobutyrate , orris butter , phenethyl alcohol , rose , rum ether , g-undecalactone , vanillin , and solvent.as i said above . nasty ! wow . just wow.now that ’ s just silly . first , we are not so fragile that 100 % of our diet must be nutrient dense . yes , absolutely , we need to eat a nutrient dense diet to be healthy . however , some of us have other needs that require attention , such as getting enough calories into my body during a 6 or a 20 hour mountain climb , some of which is at a high level of intensity . well designed sports gels ( which do not have an appalling ingredients list like the one you offered ) are , at least for me , the most effective way to support good performance . of course , what is also important is to remember to return to proper eating when you are done.i wish it were true that i could eat raisins rather than a sports gel to get the results i need during endurance sports . i ’ m jealous of those who can . but it is unreasonable to compare the motive for using a sports gel to the motive for drinking a burger king milk shake . and it is unreasonable to conflate the design and intent of these two products.why is it not true ? why can you not eat raisins during your mountain climb ? it has been said … if you cannot pronounce it … you should not be eating it . sounds sensible to me.therefore you never find idiots eating quinoa ! or are they idiots because they don ’ t eat quinoa. hmmmmmaccording to a calorie counting website , one would need ~ 2.5 mini boxes of raisins to equal one 110 calorie pack of clif shot gel ( vanilla-flavored : organic maltodextrin , organic dried cane syrup , water , natural flavor , sea salt , potassium citrate . ) . i ’ d much rather eat whole foods , however , gels can often be more convenient during * endurance runs . * in my experience , it would be hard to dispense , chew on a sufficient amount of raisins , and run at the same time during a 50k run – and get my salt intake ( to replenish what i ’ ve lost ) . ( i have almost choked on food before , while running . ) thanks for the info ! http : / / caloriecount.about.com / calories-raisins-seedless-i9298 “ however , gels can often be more convenient during * endurance runs . * ” i ’ m with you on this point . i ’ ve tried all kinds of whole foods for runs , but the packaged up gels are easiest to carry and consume while mobile , and sometimes at high speeds.very true for 50k . even the gels can be stomach upsetting by the end of a marathon.right on.dear rc brillantes . take one cup of raisins , 2 tbsp water , chuck into operating food blender , add optional cinnamon , or other flavours … .pour blended mix into plastic food bag , twist & tie knot trim excess for convenience , keep in freezer till day before required … .tear open corner of bag with fingers and teeth whilst running , and drink contents . your welcome.ha ha , loooove your sense of humour . “ raisin flavoured raisins . ” : - ) i stopped eating those bars … read , read , read the labels .. warning .. bad fats ! hi , looking for advice on increasing calories for a whole foods plant-based type ii diabetic , training for a marathon . thanks ! i remember dr. gregor showing how green grapes are essentially the wonder bread of the plant kingdom . however , raisins are dried green grapes . i ’ ve been wondering if i should stop eating raisins for this reason . i wish they made raisins from red grapes.although the antioxidant content of green grapes compared with red is much lower , it is not an unhealthful food , and still contains an array of phytonutrients which should not be avoided. candy , cost savings , energy , energy gels , exercise , fatigue , industry influence , jelly beans , raisins , sports drinks , supplements raisins may be preferable to sports supplement jelly beans and commercial energy gels . other sports supplements may be worse than just a waste of money . see , for example , heterocyclic amines in eggs , cheese , and creatine ? and heavy metals in protein powder supplements.this is the third of a three part video series on the latest science on dried fruit . check out the last three here : compare the antioxidant content of raisins to other dried fruits in my videos dried apples versus cholesterol and better than goji berries.beans , beans , good for your heart — but only the non-jelly variety ! for more context , please refer to the following associated blog posts : best dried fruit for cholesterol and raisins vs. energy gels for athletic performance
PLAIN-2789	protein , puberty , and pollutants early onset of puberty is considered a risk factor for a number of diseases in adulthood , including hormone-related cancers , a shorter lifespan , metabolic syndrome , and cardiovascular disease . the conventional thinking has been that the age of puberty has been getting earlier and earlier because our children have been getting fatter and fatter . well our kids have been getting heavier , especially in the united states — we 're # 1 ! but while the age of a girl 's first period has been dropping in the us and asia , in europe--despite their kids getting heavier too--there hasn 't been a steady decline in puberty onset . so it may be less about how much kids are eating and more about what they 're eating . the most consistent link between diet and premature puberty has been animal protein consumption . for example , every gram of daily animal protein intake — that 's the weight of a paperclip — is association with a 17 % increase in the risk of girls starting their periods earlier than age 12 . why this link between animal protein and premature puberty ? well we know meat increases the levels of the growth hormone igf-1 and that alone is associated with early onset puberty , but maybe animal protein is just a proxy for the endocrine disrupting chemicals that build up the food chain in animal products . recent reports found " significant associations between exposure to environmental pollutants and sexual maturation . " this was done in europe . in the u.s. a similar relationship was found with the flame retardant chemicals found in fish and chicken . " over the last three decades , human exposure levels of these industrial pollutants in the u.s. have increased from virtually nonexistent to almost everyone carrying them around . they appear to have multiple adverse effects , but " of all the potential toxicities , endocrine disruption may be the major concern in children . and those with the most circulating in their bloodstream appeared up to 10 times more likely to start their period early . but since they 're found most concentrated in the diet in fish and chicken maybe the level of these chemicals in their bloodstream is just kind of a proxy for meat consumption . either way , more animal protein is associated with early onset puberty , whereas plant protein has the opposite effect " children with higher intakes of vegetable proteins start puberty 7 months later than average , and children eating more animal protein start puberty 7 months earlier than average . soy seems most protective . " girls with the highest levels of dietary isoflavone intake — the phytonutrients in soy foods--may experience their onset of breast development approximately 7 – 8 months later than girls with the lowest levels of intake . " what effect might these shifts have on disease rates ? well " delays in the timing of puberty in response to beneficial dietary habits ( higher intakes of vegetable protein and soy , and lower intakes of animal protein ) may be of substantial public health relevance : a later age of starting ones period is related to a reduced risk of breast cancer , and a later first period is associated with a lower total mortality , meaning a longer lifespan . hence , a delay in the timing of puberty by approximately 7 – 8 months that is achievable with dietary modifications — either more plants or fewer animals--may translate into a 6 % reduction in breast cancer risk and an up to 3 % decrease in total mortality . and not just a problem in girls , boys eating more meat in childhood appear more likely to grow up with the kind of abdominal fat deposits that increase risk for heart disease . i ’ m wondering if 0.90 and 0.91 are that different ( although i totally believe in general message – another point from china study which gets verified by another resource i trust ) . btw i noticed caucasian teen guys who do wrestling get bald extremely early – so i was wondering if it is meat and / or excercise or probably both leading to excessive hormone production .. it might be the steroids young athletes are inclined to take theses days.it could also be the supplements that many young athletes take : whey protein , creatine and i just saw that they have an igf-1 in powder form.what is the lesser evil gmo plant protein or chemical laden animal protein ? both are avoidable , and the animal has probably been eating gmo all its life anyway.gmo1. is this a genuine question or just a straw man ? why is non-gmo plant protein not an option ? 2 . let ’ s pretend it ’ s not an option : 80 % of corn and 90 % of soy in the u.s. is fed to animals , not people . a pound of meat requires sixteen pounds of grain to produce . now which seems worse ? especially when you add in all of the other persistent fat soluble environmental toxins accumulated in the animals ’ tissues ? the answer is pretty clear.the answer is clear . buy meat that is fed what it ’ s supposed to eat : grass . the difference between a grass-fed cow and a grain-fed cow is night and day . just like you can buy homegrown organic vegetables you can buy farm raised hormone free animal products.grass fed , organically raised beef a. isn ’ t an option for 98 % of the world , due to the sheer resources it would require to raise it . b. doesnt change the fact that the animal is still subjected to toxins in the air and general environment that are unavoidable and get stored in the animal . so you subject yourself to the animals toxins and your own.what are these magical hormone-free animals you speak of pray tell ? what exactly do the use for cell-cell communication , soft whispers ? organic vegetables are not contaminant free . nothing is . your only choice is between more contaminated and less contaminated.a grass fed cow will consume even more food than a grain fed cow due to the lower caloric density . their food may not be genetically modified , but they are still part of the food chain , their food still contains environmental pollutants , and they are still concentrating them in their tissues.how people can think that the nutritional profile of an animal completely changes with its diet is beyond me . if i eat mostly kale , or mostly corn , sure an analysis of my tissues may lead to some detectable differences , but it ’ s still going to be human flesh . i still produce hormones , i still have dioxin , pcbs , flame retardants in my tissues , i still have saturated fat in my tissues , arachidonic acid , etc.frank , both are still evil ! there are plenty of alternatively good options around for choices to keep you well ! learning about how much chemicals are circulating through our blood – so disheartening.it ’ s a shame we this info isn ’ t presented to all parents . it ’ s so vital.this may be a relatively crazy question , but could early-onset puberty have benefits in promoting earlier brain development ? i ’ m thinking especially of prefontal cortex development , which could in theory reduce risky behaviors and therefore reduce overal ( all-cause ) mortality , despite increasing the risk of certain cancers , etc . i saw that one study says it is not . but this subject / phenomenon is , on the whole , poorly understood.i ’ m so glad i found this way of eating before i have my own children ( which will probably happen in the next few years or so ) . i ’ m sure there will be all sorts of comments from the in-laws , but thanks to dr. greger i ’ ll have a mountain of information to respond to them with . i ’ ll be darned if people want to shame me into intentionally poisoning my children with animal products just to make themselves feel more comfortable.i am facing the same issue ! my husband and i will probably start trying to get pregnant in a year or two and only one of the four future grandparents has agreed to feed them how i see fit . i foresee this being a big issue in my relationships with my family members.do vegan children grow to normal height ? can you do a video on that please ? based on the science vegan children should grow taller . going through puberty early does cause a growth spurt but also closes off the growth plates . males who have lost their testicles never go through puberty and continue to grow into their twenties and end up taller . a proper vegan diet should result in delay in onset of puberty and later growth spurt and closing off of growth plates . you can eat an unhealthy vegan diet and end up as a fat vegan or a sick vegan ( see dr. mcdougall newsletters on those subjects ) december 2008 and october 2002 respectively.my four year old daughter has developed strong body odour , and has always been vegan . do you have any advice on what i should try to eliminate from her diet ? chat rooms mostly talk of animal products , others sugar & i am thinking to start with removing processed soy products as a starting place eg tofutti cream cheese a d soy sausages ! i would appreciate any diet related advice thanks ! dr. gthank you for the work you do ! i am still going back and forth on the topic of animal protein and i just wish you could help . i read both sides of the debate and i ’ m just left feeling annoyed . do any of these studies that point towards a plant based diet compare those who do eat meat but that meat is entirely grass fed , eaten in moderation , cooked in liquid and eaten along with copious amounts of plant foods and whom also live generally healthy ( no smoking , excess sugar , etc . ) ? i mean really , is all meat consumption bad ? again dr greger is fascinating and enlightening . i am 53 and didn ’ t start periods until aged 17 , i was mainly vegetarian back then , vegan now . also , the so called ‘ change of life ’ in women , i believe can be transited in a more gentle way on a vegetarian or better still vegan diet . i had no problems . thank you dr greger for all your work.the paper “ effects of lifestyle on the onset of puberty as determinant for breast cancer ” is not included in the “ sources cited ” below the video . it can be found here : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17220700and strangely , i haven ’ t been able to find the parts that are cited in the video ; for example : « children with the highest intakes of vegetable proteins or animal protein experience at least their growth-related puberty onset up to 7 months later [ … ] » where does it come from ? thank you.in the early north american trials of water fluoridation newburgh ny had its water fluoridated while kingston ny was used as a control and the water did not have its water fluoridated . the trial was started in 1945 and terminated in 1950 and declared a success in reducing tooth cavities . in the mid 1950 ’ s an md , i don ’ t remember his name , reviewed the data . one of his many observations was that the girls in newburgh started puberty 6 months earlier than the girls in kingston . it should be noted that the water sources for the two cities was different at the time with differing mineral content also . this is described in christopher bryson ’ s book “ the fluoride deception ” .however in trials with monkeys and mongolian gerbils a similar effect is observed . these trials were conducted with good protocol.earlier , post 1950 , a chinchilla rancher made the same observation in his chinchillas . he also believed that there was a transgenerational effect also.these studies give support to the idea that endocrine disrupters are a cause of the early onset of puberty.dr. greger discusses fluoride here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / the-dangers-of-fluoride / the cause of early puberty is probably multifactorial . the trend started before the introduction of the many artificial chemicals such as phthalates . many of the persistent organic pollutants probably contribute to the problem . fluoride is another issue that is complex . interestingly as dr. greger pointed out in his video avoiding common disorders dental caries appear to be a more recent problem for us .. courtesy of the food processing industry . from a complex systems perspective introducing one chemical to prevent one problem has the potential for unanticipated consequences which can be either good or bad . we will probably never know about these since we don ’ t invest the time or have the expertise to look for these effects . our reductionistic approach to our health has led to many advances but we need to understand its limitations. abdominal fat , adolescence , animal products , animal protein , asia , body fat , breast cancer , breast development , breast disease , breast health , cancer , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , children , endocrine disruptors , europe , fat , fish , flame-retardant chemicals , growth promoters , heart disease , heart health , hormones , igf-1 , industrial toxins , isoflavones , lifespan , longevity , meat , men 's health , metabolic syndrome , mortality , persistent organic pollutants , phytonutrients , plant protein , poultry , premature puberty , protein , puberty , seafood , sexual health , soy , turkey , vegetable protein , women 's health the early onset of puberty in girls associated with animal protein consumption may be due to endocrine disrupting chemical pollutants in the meat supply . for more videos on this topic see : if you 're not familiar with igf-1 , i have a series of videos about the growth hormone ( though mostly in relation to cancer risk ) . see , for example , the answer to the pritikin puzzle and cancer-proofing mutation . and if you 've never heard of " metabolic syndrome " i talk about it in metabolic syndrome and plant-based diets . is it possible to overdo soy ?

PLAIN-2799	meat fumes : dietary secondhand smoke the last time i talked about this study was in the context of carcinogens in the smell of frying bacon , the ability of the fumes generated by frying meat to mutate dna , potentially explaining both the “ increased risk of respiratory tract cancer among cooks ” as well as the “ lower proportion of deaths from respiratory diseases and lung cancer among vegetarians . ” this was borne out in a new study on the exposure of pregnant women to both the consumption of grilled meat as well as exposure to the airborne fumes of grilling meat , even if they didn 't eat it . yes , the study found that evidence that prenatal exposure polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a diet including grilled meat might be hazardous for fetal development . for example , the effect of ingested barbecued meat consumed in the last pregnancy trimester resulted in birth weight deficit of 165 g , a smaller birth weight . but even if she didn 't eat it , airborne exposure alone amounted to a birth weight deficit . compared to no exposure , oral or airborne , just being around the barbeque was associated with a birth weight deficit , including a smaller head circumference in the newborn . see , after being absorbed into the body , these cooked meat compounds are distributed to almost all internal organs and are transferred through the placenta to the fetus , and it appears that newborns and young children are especially vulnerable to the toxic effects in terms of birth outcomes , most importantly , it was recently documented that prenatal exposure to airborne pah may also have an effect on the future cognitive development of children . even just living next door to a restaurant preparing meat may pose a hazard . they measured the incremental lifetime cancer risk , the excess cancer cases expected in back-door neighbors of restaurants given what 's spewing out of the exhaust outlets attached the the fume hoods in the kitchen . they compared what was coming out of chinese restaurants , american style restaurants , and barbeque joints . which do you think was worse ? chinese ! why not the barbeque places ? they think it might be because of the fish . they 're broiling more fish in chinese restaurants than in the barbeque joints . how bad is it ? they estimate that given the excess cancer risk you wouldn 't want to live behind a chinese restaurant more than a day or two a month , though maybe you can squeeze in an extra day behind one of the other restaurants . their model suggests it may be easier for adults since they breathe more , eat more , and have more skin for the carcinogens to be absorbed through compared to children . instead of trying to breathe less , though , it might be easier to just move , or convince the restaurant to go vegetarian . and most certainly don ’ t grill your children ! many food stores intentionally exhaust cooking fumes from their deli department into their entrances . it has been shown to increase the amount of food purchased in that store . i try not inhale , just like bill clinton.just in time for all those super bowl tailgate parties.the absolute best restaurant in my town , bar none , is a vegan chinese place . absolutely delicious ! i recommend looking around your town to see if you have something similar . i live in a relatively small city and we still have a restaurant like this . it is not advertised that way , so you have to look to find it . maybe your city will have something similar – all the traditional chinese foods you are used to , plus other dishes , and still all vegan . perfect ! i wish ! 98 % of my area ’ s residents will ask what a vegan is ! ( groan ) oh boy . that ’ s tough . that ’ s a whole different world . my thoughts are with you … .what can make a grown man stop grilling ? a pissed off , pregnant wife armed with this information ! the jedrychowski study seems like one that faces a huge correlation / causality hurdle . i suspect next to impossible to separate effects on fetal development from inhaling bbq fumes and other environmental impacts of living in the same household environment.the chen study is much more compelling here . continuous restaurant fumes and somewhat randomized back-door neighbors would tend to cancel out household to household environmental variation.i was just sent this email : i ’ m not up for gewtting into a debate with you every time i write something on my wall about veganism , the evidence is conclusive for me , vegan diets killed or main people . so either stop posting on my wall or i will remove you . i do not wish to put my energy in the direction of someone who discounts other peoples experiences in the pursuit of his own agenda ! the comment : ( january 31 , 2013 ) : what she says on the link is misleading . she equates a vegetarian diet as being bad for the planet because it involves cutting down the rainforests and destroying the planet ’ s topsoil . but all that deforestation is to grow grain for factory farms . vegans don ’ t advocate for that . grasses are good as they hold the topsoil , but why have pasture land for grass-fed , methane-farting cows ? that ’ s still the animal-slaughter business . plant fruits trees and walnut trees with gardens in between . fruit sugar , carbs , is what the human brain runs on . there can be some animals , but they are for loving , not eating . lierre keith slanders the vegan lifestyle , yet apparently she was never really a vegan , and her logic in equating bad agriculture and a vegan lifestyle is flawed . the science , nutritionfacts.org , china study , etc . , demonstrate that it is the animal protein and fats , not only the pesticides and hormones of modern factory farming , that stimulates cancer and causes heart disease and so many illnesses.i find it amusingly ironic that an anarcho-primitivitivist ( hunter-gatherer reactionary ) as keith is using such advanced technology as facebook … or even a computer.the smell of super bowl grilling hangs thick in the air while i walk the dog , and all i can think about is the message in this video.what do you think of liquid smoke ? is this just as dangerous ? what do you think of liquid smoke ? is this just as dangerous ? dr michael i think you are one interesting person , i really enjoy listening to these videos very much lolwhat a great resource your website is , doc ! perfect for cutting through the hype to provide evidence-based arguments.meat cooked at high temperatures ( roast , grill , bbq , fry ) seems to be far more harmful than meat cooked at lower temperatures ( poach / steam , microwave , boiled soup / stew , slow-cook crockpot ) .what are the best studies to show this ? has anyone looked at large populations over a long period ? i wonder whether the negative effects of eating meat might be largely cancelled out by only using lower temperature cooking methods ? i have a nitrate sensitivity ( acts like an allergy : hives , itchy throat , burning tongue ) . recently , have had some mild reactions when around ball games , food courts , etc . i was wearing gloves and did not eat anything . can nitrates be carried through the air ? animal products , animal protein , bacon , beef , cancer , carcinogens , chicken , children , cooking methods , dna damage , fish , infants , lung cancer , lung disease , lung health , meat , mouth cancer , nasal cavity cancer , oral cancer , oxidative stress , plant-based diets , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , pork , poultry , pregnancy , protein , restaurants , throat cancer , tongue cancer , tonsil cancer , turkey , vegans , vegetarians , voice box cancer , women 's health the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the vapors released from cooking meat may be hazardous for fetal development and increase the risk of cancer . the link to the previous video i referenced is carcinogens in the smell of frying bacon.how else can we protect the next generation ? check out : have you tried our improved search function ? if you put in pregnancy in the search box in the upper right-hand corner you 'll see that this is just a sample from the 79 results.how else can we protect our lungs ? see preventing copd with diet and treating copd with diet.for some context , please check out my associated blog post : heading shrinking from grilling meat
PLAIN-2809	apple skin : peeling back cancer apples themselves are awesome , but it ’ s not because of the juice in them but rather , perhaps , primarily what ’ s found in the peel . within the last year half a dozen studies have touted the benefits of apple peels , for example this one in the journal nutrition and cancer . the antiproliferative effects of apple peel extract against cancer cells . we know the more apples we eat , the lower our apparent risk of several cancers . the peels are the really good part , yet are often discarded . for example apple peel is a waste product of dried apple manufacturing ; in one little country chile , they throw away 9,000 tons of apple peels a year . that 's like 20 million pounds--a tragedy ! so these researchers decided to see what we ’ re missing . here are two cell lines of human prostate cancer and two of human breast cancer growing merrily away in petri dishes — they ’ re the little black dots you can see . they are blissfully unaware that researchers at the university of wisconsin were at whole foods buying some organic gala apples . the peels were thrown in a blender and a tiny bit dripped on the unsuspecting cancer cells . and then a bit more and a little more and as you can see by the end neither the prostate nor breast cancer cells were very happy . this ain ’ t chemo ; it ’ s just apple peels . how did they do it ? “ to obtain a clue regarding the mechanism they determined the effect of apple peels on the tumor suppressor protein maspin inside the cancer cells . maspin is a tumor suppressor gene that has been shown to have tumor suppressor , antiangiogenic and antimetastatic properties in both breast and prostate cancer cells . the tumor cells found a way to turn this gene off ; and apple peels turned it back on . an upregulation of this tumor suppression gene as you add more and more of the apple peel extract to each of the cancer types . they conclude apple peels may possess strong antiproliferative effects against cancer cells , and they should not be discarded from the diet . dr greger , if i juice the apples , with the skin on of course , am i reaping the benefits or does juicing change the antiproliferative effect of maspin ? thank you audrey pellicanodr don i hope you don ’ t mind . i found this comment on another video and thought audrey might find it helpful . i believe dr greger has said the whole food is generally best . don ’ t we lose the fiber with juicing ? drdons schilly76 • 8 months ago − as a general rule when foods are processed ( blended ) or nutrients are extracted ( water , fiber ) they are less beneficial . as this video shows there are exceptions to the rule when dealing with complex systems . garlic needs to be crushed to allow for the mixing of chemicals to liberate an antioxidant that is beneficial . broccoli is another interesting case see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / vide … . cooking is another variable that needs to be considered see video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / vide … . since juicing removes fiber it is less beneficial as fiber is a valuable nutrition . dr. greger has done 25 videos touching on the value of fiber but you might start with http : / / nutritionfacts.org / vide … .this is the first time that i ’ ve seen a comment that notes that blending food is less beneficial.i have green smoothies about every other day . they include almond milk , greek yogurt , lots of spinach , a banana , strawberries , blueberries , unpasteurized honey , chia seeds , and hemp seeds . everything is raw.i felt like blending all of these items had no effect on their nutritional content ( since they are all whole , raw , and uncooked when they go into a blender ) . am i mistaken ? ? ? ( lay the truth on me ) only in that the question was about juicing not blending . you dump the fiber when you juice . i guess some people save it and use it in cooking.hello , blending too much spinach raw could pose health risks because of the oxalates . also , blending is oxidation the greens faster which reduces their nutritional value quickly if not consumed soon . tata.i have a centrifugal juicer and when i juice an apple , a lot of the peel goes into the bin yes , but for for all that the first part of the juice i get is very red , so some of it is going into the juice as well . if you get the seeds and stem out first , you can always collect the juiced fiber from the bin and use it . personally , i find apple peel very difficult to eat . at least on the typical red apple . maybe i should try gala apples.to eat a chicken , eat like one . how about them apples ’ – peels ! i like to dry fruit , including apples . drying apples with the skin on results in a tough and unpleasant texture to the skin . so i peel the apples i intend to dry , save the peel , and use it in my fruit and vegetable smoothies . my vitamix will wiz that peel down to a liquid and results in a good taste , a nice mouthfeel , and of course , all that nutrition . caveat : be sure to use organic.more generally , if you buy into the concept of whole foods , dump the juicer and invest in a superblender such as vitamix . your body will thank you.this video was so fun ( those poor unsuspecting cancer cells ! ) and so clear.i eat an apple a day during winter . ( my dog gets some too . ) as a kid , i hated the skin . as an adult , i tolerate it , but don ’ t like it . so of course we learn that that ’ s the healthiest part. sigh.just as vitally important for exploding cancer cells is eating the seeds with the rest of the apple.celticson : you post surprises me . i thought that apple seeds contain significant amounts of arsenic and that one should definitely not eat them . i ’ m curious why you would advocate eating the seeds . do you do that yourself ? do you have a link to a study that uses apple seeds ? thanksno arsenic but does contain cyanide . good news- the rest of the apple has counter-properties for the cyanide , so all is balanced nicely.thanks for the correction ! balancing cyanide ? i don ’ t know about that … thea et al . , please note : dr. g reports science and cites refs . what does eve do “ so you don ’ t have to ” ? can you choose wisely ? was this study done with organic apples ? if so , i wonder if same results will apply with non organic ? i try to eat organic apples . but if it is not organic , i wonder if it ’ s healthier to take the peel off ? wish there was a way to edit or delete . just saw vid- organic ! cell lines in a petri dish are better than nothing i suppose but may not extend that much to cancer cells in situ . it would be nice to know if the cancer cells were primary cultures or cell lines instead.what i do is i thinly slice the apples on a mandoline slicer leaving the peel on . i then sprinkle cinnamon on the slices and then place them in the oven for about two hours . at the end i have apple chips or crisps and i can easily eat three apples worth without feeling full . it one of my favorite snacks i make , that and sweet potato chips.hey kip ! great idea . i don ’ t know if you are raw vegan or not , but wondering about temp. and also do you use lemon or anything to avoid oxydation ? why is store bought apple fiber not made with just apple peels and not the center sugar laden portioni start my day with a smoothie made from fresh ( mostly organic ) fruits , vegetables , nuts , seeds , protein powder , cinnamon and almond milk . i always include an apple ( seeds , peel and all ) . i look forward to the smoothie every morning because it is so delicious ! apparently the seeds are a good source of cyanide , which will collects in you system . i too , ate the whole apple until i read that factoid in the paper about 5 years ago. http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / cyanidethis puts a different spin an earlier video “ dried apples vs. cholesterol , ” 1 / 12 / 12 , the problem is it ’ s hard to find dried apple rings with the skin on . by the way , i ’ ve heard the same thing about seeds , how could any amount of cyanide be tolerable ? sorry , 1 / 10 / 12.i don ’ t remember the last time i peeled my apples — perhaps childhood . nowadays , all but the core goes into the vitamix with other fruits . thanks dr. greger , team , and apples . : ) http : / / www.deccanherald.com / content / 304101 / superfoods-may-cause-cancer-nobel.html dr. greger – please comment on this article . it ’ s already posted by the plant based crowd who dismiss the power of “ super foods . ” which is the amount recommended for daily consumption of apple skin to prevent cancer ? it has the same effect if consumed dehydrated ? i follow dr. greger ’ s reviews of the research with great interest so i am very keen to hear his reaction to this research : http : / / life.nationalpost.com / 2013 / 01 / 10 / u-s-failing-in-war-on-cancer-and-antioxidants-superfoods-focus-is-part-of-the-problem-dna-research-pioneer / by dr. francis crick concerning the possibly negative influence of antioxidant loading through food intake . it was just a quick read but what i took away from it was that these foods may interfere with the action of chemo during treatment.i left stage iiib lobular invasive carcinoma behind me fifteen years ago after the usual treatment regimen of slash , poison , and burn ( for which i am grateful , despite my description of it ) but now sustain life and health with a whole plant food , no processed ‘ phood ’ , low fat eating plan . and yes , i do load up on antioxidants with a home made tea blend of rose hips , hibiscus , fresh ginger , amla , and lemon . i love it and hope that since i no longer take any prescription medication that this concoction is doing me a lot of good and maxing out what i can do to prevent a recurrence.i think it ’ s pretty easy to comment on the given article … dr. francis crick fails to offer a succession of reproducible peer-reviewed scientific studies in support of his contention . facts trump rhetoric and opinion , every time – regardless of your credentials.well said totally agree ! good day dr. greger , i would like to firstly thank you for providing nutritional facts to the general public for creating a deep understanding of dietary and lifestyle improvement and to debunk the food myths the food industry markets heavily to us.i do not know whether or not you take video requests. but if so i would greatly appreciate if you did a discussion on phytic acid and its beneficial or detrimental impacts on our system . i have recently found a video by these youtubers http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

how safe is it ? “ the benefits of eating the peels ( even from conventional apples ) far outweighs any risk that may come from the pesticide exposure ” and “ one should never let pesticide concerns lead one to skimp on fruit and vegetable consumption ” … really ? so children and those with weakened or haywire immune systems should have no concerns about toxic load ? it ’ s blanket statements like this from supposed medical professionals that make me angry . conventional agriculture is slowly making us sick – sometimes not so slowly – and you would have us just go along with being poisoned ? you are ignorant.http : / / www.ewg.orgthe point is , if you have a choice between organic candy or conventional apples , you should not consume the andy out of fear of pesticides . the health benifits of the apple far outweight the candy.says you ? you need to read a biti understand your concerns . the pesticides are worrying , but the primary issue in the united states is lack of fruit consumption . the first priority should be to consume enough fruits and vegetables , as avoiding them due to fear of pesticides will bring more harm then eating a fruit with pesticides . once we have reached adequate level of consumption , the next hurdle would be to try to buy organic as much possible.eata mea : let ’ s keep nutritionfacts a place for respectful debate . — — - i thought i would add to toxins ’ excellent reply so you can see that there are hard numbers to back up what he is saying . consider the following quote from one of dr. greger ’ s blog posts , where he puts pesticide consumption into perspective . : “ a new study calculated that if half the u.s. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables , 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented . at the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases . so by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk , but that ’ s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption . even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks . ” for more information : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 06 / 25 / apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes / hope that helps.thanks for that information thea , i was not aware of those numbers . very useful knowledge to have for sure.i love apple peel . if i didn ’ t feel bad about throwing the rest , i would eat only apple peels.fascinating article , it does make me wonder about apple cider vinegar in this scenario.keep it simple and eat a couple apples a day ! most apples are loaded with cancer causing pesticides. so … … … .. i am wondering about the consumption of other edible peels , say of tomatoes , potatoes , cucumbers and different varieties of squash . what are the benefits vs. risks of pesticide expose of these foods ? i ; love apples , but it ’ s getting hard to find any that aren ’ t coated with wax ( or whatever it is they dip them in ) . even organically grown apples are often coated . i now peel my apples to avoid eating the coating . is it safe to eat it ? i think it not only adds unwanted chemicals to the diet , apples with this treatment have a mushier texture and less flavor. angiogenesis , antiangiogenesis , apple juice , apples , breast cancer , cancer , dried fruit , epigenetic changes , fruit , fruit juice , gala apples , juice , men 's health , organic foods , polyphenols , prostate cancer , tumor suppressor genes , women 's health apple peels appear to upregulate the tumor suppressor gene maspin and have strong antiproliferative effects on breast and prostate cancer cell growth in vitro . what 's wrong with just drinking apple juice ? see my last video apple juice may be worse than sugar water . peeling conventionally grown apples does get rid of a significant proportion of the pesticides , but the benefits of eating the peels ( even from conventional apples ) far outweighs any risk that may come from the pesticide exposure . of course one can get all the benefits without the risks by choosing organic , but one should never let pesticide concerns lead one to skimp on fruit and vegetable consumption . to see what a whole diet full of plant foods can do to prostate and breast cancer cell growth see ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay and the answer to the pritikin puzzle , respectively . more on the wonders of apples in dried apples versus cholesterol and apples & breast cancer.for some more context , please check out my associated blog posts : dr. greger 's natural nausea remedy recipe , apple peels turn on anticancer genes , and breast cancer & alcohol : how much is safe ?
PLAIN-2819	potassium and autoimmune disease potassium is best known for lowering blood pressure and stroke risk , but “ a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial of potassium supplementation was tried in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , ” published in the journal of pain . rheumatoid arthritis is kind of the classic autoimmune inflammatory arthritis . sufferers tend to have inappropriately low glucocorticoid levels , which are circulating steroid hormones like cortisol that suppress inflammation , and so low levels may allow for more inflammation . glucocorticoids also help our kidneys excrete potassium , and so when we eat a lot of potassium , our adrenal glands secrete more glucocorticoids so we don ’ t build up too much , and so maybe if you gave people with rheumatoid arthritis some extra potassium it would boost steroid levels and help with the inflammation . so they bumped their daily intake up to 6500 a day — still not reflective of our evolutionary heritage , but at least making the cut for adequate intake — and indeed , higher potassium intake was associated with an improvement in rheumatoid arthritis and a lower disease activity and pain intensity reflecting an anti-pain effect for potassium ” and so they suggest planning a successful dietary regimen , including much more use of leafy vegetables . those placed on a plant-based diet experience a significant increase in potassium intake . though even those eating vegan aren 't eating enough greens , maybe this bump in potassium helps explain why plant-based diets are so effective at treating rheumatoid arthritis . if this is the mechanism , though , if potassium rich foods boost natural anti-inflammatory hormones in the body , then should it work for other inflammatory conditions ? that ’ s exactly what was suggested recently . some studies have shown vegetarian diets to improve psoriasis symptoms maybe this is why , suggesting a “ cortisol-potassium ” theory as a novel mechanism for the beneficial effects of vegetarian diets . would more potassium in your diet have an effect on frozen shoulder ( adhesive capsulitis ) ? good question ! i have suffered twice in both shoulders and would love to be able to prevent another recurrence . of course , i wasn ’ t eating vegan at the time.i was eating vegan when it started , that ’ s why i am wondering if there is anything i can do diet-wise to help . i know physio is a must with daily excercises but work kind of sucks because of the amount of time i spend on the computer . moving that mouse and typing all day is killing me.larry l , vegan diets can vary in their degrees of healthy versus processed and unhealthy content . if you are eating all the “ fake ” meats and cheeses and eating from packages rather than the produce section then the vegan diet is probably no more healthy than the standard american diet.grains can also play a dramatic role in the inflammation process for many people . start by going gluten free but if that still doesn ’ t help , then i would suggest cutting out all grains . there are theory ’ s that cross sensitivity with grains can cause problems as well . focus on plants , legumes , tubers and squash for your diet and see if that makes a difference in how you feel.good luck in your journey . laura ki follow mcdougall ’ s diet pretty much , very little processed foods , pasta , beans , rice and lots of fruits and vegetables . i eat the occasional bag of potato chips mind you . i have always eaten grains so maybe cutting out gluten , as you say , might help.i would strongly recommend massage therapy for adhesive capsulitis , if your rmt or lmt is familiar with treating this . if not , call around and find someone who is . on your own , lie on your stomach and allow your arm to swing like a pendulum to help open up the joint capsule.sorry to hear about your condition . adhesive capsulitis is a tough disorder but given correct treatment and time usually responds . diet wise it sounds like you are doing great . you should continue to eat a variety of fruits , vegetables and spices … see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / garden-variety-anti-inflammation / and want to avoid alot of omega 6 ’ s in processed oils especially corn oil … easy to do if you eat whole foods and avoid foods with labels . lastly you could consider taking a omega 3 supplement daily see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2 / . your condition is well recognized but the underlying mechanism ’ s are poorly understood and treatments are evolving . a review article … abstract available through pubmed , frozen shoulder in j bone joint surg jan 2012 by robinson et al provides an overview . i don ’ t think potassium will help but by eating a variety of plant foods you will get more potassium . best wishes.where are you getting that info ? you are probably iodine deficient . i suffered with extreme pain for 1 1 / 2 years with a frozen shoulder that refused to heal , despite three courses of pt and an anti-inflammatory diet . when i added iodine it healed 90 % in one week , and 100 % by one month . read about iodine by googling iodine protocol . i don ’ t believe in the crazy-high amounts that are advocated ; but no doctor will disagree with 1 mg ( 1000 mcg ) a day . i actually take 6.25 mg a day for cancer prevention , and have benefited greatly from it , and it gave my thyroid enough iodine ( i was hypothyroid ) that i need no thyroid meds . it ’ s amazing stuff , and we ’ re all deficient . iodized salt doesn ’ t cut it.one of the journal screen shots states “ more use of leafy green vegetables low in starch and not cooked with boiling water . ” does steaming leafy greens keep more potassium than boiling them ? if not , how do we cook leafy greens to prevent loss of potassium . is all of the postassium lost when boiling ? potassium , as well as other minerals and water-soluble vitamins , leaks into the water you use to boll your vegetables . thus , unless you consume that water too , you waste a significant part of the mineral and vitamin content of your food if you boil it . steaming does not present the same problem.what about washing greens in a very weak vinegar / water bath as my local farmer ’ s market recommended for all fruits and veggies ? that is to clean them and also to reduce e coli related food poisoning ( lots of that happening with veggies due to water runoff – or can even be just from unclean hands of pickers and handlers , etc . does this also leech nutrients ? the bath allows the addition of anti-bacterial vinegar . just running water has no anti-bacterial properties , so the quick bath seems the only way to really clean them . are they then much less nutritious ? this would probably leech no more than what rain would also do . solubility increases with temperature . when you boil your veggies in hot water , you have high temperature and prolonged contact . when you wash them , you use cold water and for a short contact.some people believe that raw is the way to go with leafy greens . i personally like mine cooked , which makes it tough to follow my doctor ’ s recent dietary recommendations.i am writing a book about the benefits on a plant-based-diet and needn ’ t i say more . michael , there is no need for you to keep putting on any more videos on your site , if people have not realized this by now , then they are either blind or do not want to listen.the real problem is that people are either lacking the knowledge or have been brainwashed about the system mankind has adapted about drugs , bad advertisements about food choices , diet and weight loss and not actually focusing about the benefits of diet has upon our over-all health.the health care system needs to be changed and more emphasis has to be focus on the real truth about diet ad the influence it has towards our health . prevention is better than the cure . diet is the solution and not drugs , politics power nor money.there will always be bias toward health in large cooperation ’ s and food establishments , if they do not open up their eyes and look outside the box towards good natural nutrition towards battling the fight towards disease.do i need to say more on this subject ? john from maltatrue , the issue of food and nutrition is multi-layered and complex but the science in these fields is constantly evolving and uncovering new , interesting , and applicable findings . therefore , i think there is no need to stop making these videos , as i and others are still interested in what current science has to say on the topic of plant-based nutrition and human health . yes , i am convinced of the benefits , but i still want to know and learn more . so , please do not stop ( although , i don ’ t think that you were even contemplating doing so . ) john , i understand your frustration . that being said , let me give you another perspective on the benefits of dr. greger ’ s work ( videos and blog posts ) . i ’ ve only been eating a vegan diet for four months at this point . the information dr. greger shares helps me stay enthusiastic about , and committed to , my nutrition-related goals . i agree with wholefoodchomper : the scientific community regularly uncovers new , interesting , helpful discoveries about plant-based nutrition . dr. greger does more than anyone else i know of to share that information with ordinary people throughout the world.i agree with john ’ s comments below , but by all means keep the videos coming . i find them inspirational and with 2 minute segments it makes it easy to stay up to date . i ’ ve forwarded some of your videos to quite a few friends and find they are receptive to the ideas , partly because they are packaged in the short segments.i think part of the problem is education and getting information out . the second part is that it is not easy for people to change when faced with long established habits … . what to buy , how to prepare food , etc . so it takes both knowledge and a path to follow , and you help provide both.i like the saying from toyota : “ it is easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting ” . so just providing a few simple ideas on how to get started and constant reminders is extremely useful.hi dr greger.i have some questions not related to potassium . ( sorry , i couldn ’ t find where to post general questions on your site . please feel free to move my question or to tell me to post it somewhere else ) 1 . does green tea stain your teeth as much as coffee ? 2 . do you still recommend drinking at least 5 cups of green per day ? my doctor told me i should cut down to 2 or 3 caffeinated drinks per day because my blood pressure could be a little lower ( it was still in the normal range , but towards the top ) . however , i do drink mainly coffee . 3 . would i still get all the benefits if i drank decaf green tea ? or if i drink 3 caffeinated teas and 2 decafs per day ? thankyou very muchgreen tea has less caffeine than coffee so drinking as uch tea as coffee means you ’ ve cut down caffeine . but what doesn ’ t have caffeine is tulsi aka holybasil tea . a medicinal beveravsed for thousands of years . see dr. mercola.computerdr. g has a mini-video on tulsi tea here . and , many many videos and articles on green tea here that may answer some of your questions.as for dr. mercola , i ’ d be wary of any advice he has to offer , he does not seem like a very credible source of health advice or information , at least not to me . stick to what you can learn on nutritionfacts.org instead.dr. joseph mercola ’ s education background is : university of illinois at chicago – ( uic ) 1972-1976 chicago college of osteopathic medicine 1978-1982 chicago osteopathic hospital 1982-1985 family practice residency . chief resident 1984-1985 board certified american college osteopathic general practitioners july 1985 state of illinois licensed physician and surgeonhe is a fellow at the american college of nutrition ; member of the international academy biological dentistry and medicine ; advisory board member american nutrition association ; advisory board member price-pottinger nutrition foundation ; advisory board member weston a. price foundation ; advisory board member bio-solar proto ; and was chairman , department of family practice at st. alexius medical center , hoffman estates , il 1988-1993you may not agree with him whole food chomper , but he is a credible source ! dr. mercola is a smart businessman , to be sure . however , regardless of the degrees he has obtained and the positions he has held , i believe that dr. mercola is not a credible source and am ( and will continue to be ) weary of any health / medical advice he has to offer.great info . dr. m has taken to being a supplement salesman and the discredits him to me regardless of previous education or titles . i ’ ll stick with dr gregor who is great at getting the research togather for us . then we can make our own decisions.according to dr. andrew weil , a harvard trained physician who practices alternative medicine , “ any food or drink capable of staining clothes or carpets can also stain teeth – that includes fruit juices , red wine , blueberries , soy sauce , and curry . ‘ good quality green tea that is really green in color ’ is less likely to stain teeth than inferior grades of “ green ” tea that looks brown when brewed . ” dr. weil suggests “ rinsing your mouth with water after you drink tea ( or coffee or colas ) . be sure to brush your teeth twice a day with a whitening toothpaste and to floss daily . ” more at : http : / / www.drweil.com / drw / u / id / qaa400151 “ while green tea and coffee both have caffeine , coffee has a significantly greater amount per cup . ” http : / / www.livestrong.com / article / 288832-caffeine-in-green-tea-vs-coffee / “ as long as the number of cups you drink remains the same , replacing your morning coffee with a cup of green tea will reduce your caffeine intake by about 70 % . one cup of coffee contains 100-150mg of caffeine ; a cup of green tea has only about 25mg of caffeine . however , there are many variables affecting these numbers . for example , the caffeine content of different types of green tea can vary ; also a longer brewing period can result in more strongly caffeinated tea . ” learn more : http : / / www.naturalnews.com / 034227 _ green _ tea _ caffeine.html # ixzz2gheu0pnwdr greger . , which plants prevent or help with psoriasis ? although psoriasis is based on genetic skin problem , living on vegetable lifestyle doesn ’ t fully the problem .. i have only one preventable option , based on my experience is turmeric .. some people talk about coconut butter .. any other suggestions ? i don ’ t think there is one particular plant food which helps psoriasis but a vegetarian or plant based diet in general reduces arachidonic acid ( in the body ) which serves as a precursor to pro-inflammatory substances . as you already know , psoriasis is a genetic disease but it is also triggered by inflammation mediated by t-cells . some studies ( not all ) have shown benefits with omega-3 fats , fasting or low calorie diets and vegetarianism . some people with psoriasis have gluten sensitivity and improve on gluten-free diets . wolters m , diet and psoriasis : experimental data and clinical evidence , br j dermatol . 2005 oct ; 153 ( 4 ) : 706-14.i have had relief with tea tree oil products : shampoo , conditioner , and scalp treatment . this has been much more effective than prescribed topical treatments . one dermatologist recommended black castor oil , but this is not pleasant to use on the scalp.i have a colleague who is a dermatologist who has had success with a plant based diet with attention to specific oils in his treatment of his patients with autoimmune disorders such as lupus and psoriasis . as a family medicine physician i haven ’ t had experience with diet and psoriasis . i have seen the success of proper diet across a host of chronic diseases including other autoimmune disorders . i imagine that like most chronic conditions genetics is a very small part of the picture . that said , there is literature to show that nutrition is a factor in psoriasis . you need to work with your physicians but it seems to me that a general recommendation might involve starting with a plant based diet with vitamin b12 supplement and avoidance of gmo foods . of course finding a physician who is willing to work with you and your diet while prescribing more conventional therapies is always a challenge.hi don and all – i am the dermatologist that he is referring to . here is a basic list of things everyone does.1. dairy free2 . gluten free ( no gluten free junk food like breads made from potato flour or tapioca ) 3 . oil free except very small amounts olive , coconut , or ghee4 . 1-2 lbs of veggies per day – half cooked half raw5 . only 3-4 servings of animal protein per week – vegans do not do any better than those who eat high quality animal protein in small amounts . just an observation.6. boswellia , ginger , and turmeric7 . handful of nuts per day or hemp seed oil 1 tsp twice per day8 . level of 25 , oh vit d at around 50that is the basics and things get modified as time goes by especially with efa ’ s but really if anyone wants other information please contact me on facebook . an environmental toxin discussion is done and we discuss stress reduction techniques as well . i also prescribe meds and light therapy . i practice conventional dermatology but have had great success when people want to do something different . i have offered it probably close to 1000 patients and only around 40 have taken me up on it , of those only one has not responded . cheers , jonathancan you provide a link to the data on potassium levels of various foods . i want to focus on the ones with the most potassium , the new usda national nutrient database for standard reference is now out ! our tax dollars hard at work to analyze the nutrient content of more than 8,000 foods . i ’ m so glad you asked this question , charlene , because i ’ m surprised more don ’ t know about this incredible resource . if you ’ re looking for the most concentrated sources of any particular nutrient in the new 2012 database , click here . then scroll down to potassium and click on potassium-sorted by nutrient content and poof ! a list of about a thousand foods ranked from the most concentrated source ( 2,675mg in each cup of concentrated tomato paste ) down to zero in “ foods ” like lard and hard candies . you can also download the list alphabetically to make it easier to look up your favorite foods . and that ’ s just the beginning ! warning : browsing the nutrient database can be addictive for nutrition geeks – like me ! ( though if you were a true nutrition geek you ’ d already be sleeping with the entire database under your pillow : ) .so the next time you see me do a video on fiber , for example , ( like relieving yourself of excess estrogen ) you can look up to see which foods have the most.see fat burning via flavonoids and wonder where the heck you can find them ?

dr. greger has an excellent post on this under “ ask the doctor ” : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / which-foods-have-the-most-potassium / to totally agree with mikes below comment . yes ! please dr , greger , keep up the good work and keep showing the videos you truly work very hard in showing and producing . if was not for people like you then most people who be blind to the truth about the health benefits of a plant-based-diet in the reduction of the leading causes of death and disease.the hardest part of health is actually trying to convince people to change their eating habits and lifestyle.john from maltai love how greger based his video on the estimated daily intake of paleolithic diet ( that included a lot of meat : 87mg of iron ! ) to promote a meat free diet . this website is one big contradiction.actually , dr. greger , cited 6 sources for the basis of this video and not just the 1 you refer to . i ’ m not sure how this one incident you found equals a “ website [ that ] is one big contradiction . ” how so ? could you please explain ? gee , which paleolithic diet ? there is no such thing as a “ paleolithic diet ” that is based on any paleolithic population to be used as a reference point . and there are dozens of paleolithic diets among late-20th and early-21st century theoreticians , with widely varying composition.iron abundant in dark leafy green vegetables , which don ’ t run as fast as animals and whose iron is more bio-available to humans . so there is a very high likelihood that much of the iron in early human diets came from dark leafy greens . when diagnosed with serious anemia , i spent 2 months as directed by doctors w / iron supplements & putting red meat back into my daily diet and felt like hell — different from the anemia , but yet another source of unwellness . so i told the docs i ’ d researched & found this high quality source of bio-available iron in dark leafy greens , would continue the iron supplements but wanted to swap out the dark leafies for the meat . doc approved . i went hardcore vegan w / emphasis on the dark leafies , and saw immediate improvement in how i felt day to day as well as in the underlying health problem . dr. dan , your comment together with your embedded skepticism suggests a very un-scientific mindset.hello doctor , i became vegetarian and then vegan when i was first diagnosed with ra . i also did a food challenge to eliminate any food sensitivities . i responded extremely well and although not symptom free , i looked and felt so much better . until i had my first child . he is now 3 and my daughter 1 and my ra is worse than ever . i still eat a vegan diet and i eat lots of potassium rich foods ( ie beans greens , dried fruit , banana ) although i do not eat potatoes or tomatoes . what can i do now ? i am now taking sulphasalazine and considering adding hydroxychloroquine . i have been on 10mg prednisone almost continually throughout my pregnancies and breastfeeding but am now slowly coming off 1 mg per month ( currently at 5mg . ) any advice appreciated as i am only 38 and i ’ ve seen my hands and feet rapidly changing in the past year . thank you.melissahave you went gluten free ? i have ra and i feel so much better ( still struggling with symptoms … . ) but less miserable , especially with my stomach.not being much of a scientist , i need to break this down to what should i do . are you saying that cordisol is not a bad thing after all . what is the difference between glucose-codisol and codisol that we are warned comes from stress and contributes to over weight , and i thought many other bad things . or am i all mixed up on this ? i am on a all plant diet with a big green salad in the evening . i often put greens in my meals too , but have to say that i don ’ t pile up my plate with swiss chard , or collards . is that the suggestion here ? cortisol ( a glucocorticoid ) , is a hormoone produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and is released during periods of stress and when blood sugar runs low ( hypoglycemia ) . this hormone is essential for life and for survival as it is part of the “ fight-or-flight ” response . when under stress ( physical , mental or emotional ) , cortisol is released into the bloodstream to provide us with the ability to handle the stress by increasing blood sugar ( glucose ) for energy so we can fight or to flee the danger .. it is only when too much , or too little , cortisol is released over long periods of time that we run into a problem . too much cortisol , over long periods of time , may be caused from chronic stress , such as constant worrying , feeling overwhelmed by too many responsibilities , and / or dealing with a long term crisis in your life . when too much cortisol is produced over long periods of time it has been shown to have detrimental health effects . one symptom of too much cortisol may be an increase in weight gain , especially around the middle increasing ones risk of cardiovascular and other disease . on the other hand , too little cortisol , leaves us feeling depleted and incapable of dealing with with lifes little stressors and weakens our immune system . cortisol is essential for life – it is about having the right amount released at the appropriate time and then returning to normal after the danger has passed.regarding the greens – try incorporating them into soups and casseroles , sneak them into all your meals so you can get more into your diet.hi there i suffer of chronic psoriasis , i take methrotexate whicch harms my liver , is there any kind of food i must avoid , i have recently did a cleansing though and i fell much better . please help me out , it is much appreciate it. thanks in advancedr . greger- i have plaque psoriasis and i eat a gluten free vegan diet . do you have any other dietary suggestions to help alleviate my psoriasis and boost my immunity ? any research dr. about psoriatic arthritis ? my brother has it and he takes a shot for it every month . i suggested he try a vegan diet and he shrugged it off.hello doctor ( s ) , my questions is regarding potassium supplements . specifically , i can refer to trophic brand ’ s potassium chelate 90mg .. it is designed to absorb readily . it says to take 1 / day — i took one yesterday but felt my heart beating a bit faster and a few other twinges : this was after reading the side-effects of potassium to watch for ( heart attacks , paralysis , etc . ) . there wasn ’ t any warning label on the bottle , so i drank another glass of water , reassured myself , then felt fine . if it were so dangerous i would think there would be some indication on their labelling or website but there isn ’ t.what do you think of supplements ? on the dr. oz tv show , he indicated 4700mg / day — how do we know we ’ ve reached that ? what does that look like ? he also said its good for brain fog ( which i experience sometimes ) so thought i ’ d try potassium supplements in addition to my varied diet ( consists of a variety of things , but nothing processed and very low gluten ) .would you recommend potassium for brain fog – or another supplement ? should i stop taking this potassium supplement or only take half a pill ? what benefits should i watch for so i know that it is working ? thank you : ) if your dr. has not prescribed potassium supplements for a specific medical reason and your primary basis for taking these supplements is information from the dr. oz show , i would immediately cease potassium supplements . a diet rich in plants can provide more then enough potassium . a single serving of any fruit provides 10 % of the dv of potassium , beans are rich in potassium , as are greens . its not something you should actively seek if consuming a healthy diet . i would also not get information from dr. oz . he flips flops between many diets , advocates for many junk supplements and often brings guests on his show who speak to the dead.toxins : re : dr. oz . i recently saw an article that said that some researchers took x numbers of dr. oz shows and then collected and researched all the medical claims . i don ’ t remember all of the exact numbers , but it was something like half were shown to be incorrect and a certain percentage more shown to have no backing in the medical literature . i knew it was bad , but wow . that ’ s really bad.i can ’ t say i ’ m surprised ! thanks for your reply . my primary reason was actually to reduce the brain fog . what natural or supplement would you recommend ? ( there were other questions on my original post as well ) valerie , i don ’ t know of any supplement to reduce brain fog . that falls out of my expertise . this may not help at all , but are you consuming enough omega 3 ? try eating a couple tablespoons of flax a day . other than that , i am unable to help you . it may be something you should talk with your dr. about.thanks for your reply . my primary reason was actually to reduce the brain fog . what natural or supplement would you recommend ? i hope it is not too late to make a comment here , but as just about everything to do with health and nutrition i find this so confusing.when i look at a periodic table of the elements , potassium is in the same group , group 1 , as sodium . yet they say that it is so important to get your potassium for the day … almost 7.5 grams of the stuff … and as far as sodium it is like 2.5 grams i think – but sodium is bad for blood pressure , and potassium is good ? does this make sense ? how can this be explained , and furthermore … how on earth can i ever get 7.5 grams of potassium a day unless i spend all day eating bananas and drinking coconut water ? i ’ ll do it if i have to , but someone please explain this , show me the way ! ; - ) i think the recommendation for potassium is 4700mg per day . someone commented on this a bunch as we tried to weed thru how much 4700 really looks like ! check this out if interested we have a fairly long comment thread in the beginning . thanks , brux.sounds like another reason to switch to 50 % potassium chloride salt for cooking if your salt intake is on the high side.it ’ s a sad thing to see only one video under cortisol . this truly shows the ignorance of the doctor and his lack of knowledge on health in general.cortisol plays the most prominent roll in health as it ’ s what ’ s released by the body in response to stressors . it manifests itself as insulin resistance ( type 2 diabetes ) . it chooses what fuel to burn ( carbs , proteins , fats ) which is the difference in weight gain and loss . it plays a prominent roll in the immune system function , and ultimately it decides whether you are healthy or not.your body needs salt ( iodine ) so good salt , because your thyroid needs it for it ’ s function . your body also needs potassium but in much greater quantities . think a ration of potassium to sodium of 3-5 : 1 . you don ’ t have to worry about potassium : sodium ratio ’ s as long as your diet is rich in vegetables , animal proteins and saturated fats.you may have lots of great ideas and information bobby , but just showing up and calling the doctor ignorant and saying we all ought to believe what you say without any proof is a bit unrealistic and in fact just rude . if you have something to say explain what it is , and tell us what you base this on.how does cortisol “ choose what fuel to burn ” ? where do you get this 3-5 : 1 potassium to sodium ratio ? how do you know your iodine level and how much should we get ? really , put up , or … you know what . not trying to be a jerk , but millions of people who do not know what they are talking about post comments like this all over the place . you have to support your arguments ! agreed . anyone is free to comment , but please be respectful and include research if possible to give everyone a chance to try and understand better . thanks for this nice post brux.dr. gregor , thanks for the interesting video . i have ra and i am on my elimination diet and cannot handle most of the food . some foods increase flare in my symptoms and i am working hard to understand those culprits . i am concerned about my daily potassium intake , as your study shows that potassium is important for ra people . so , the only option left with me , for the time being , is to take supplements . but when i read about potassium supplements , there are so many different types of potassium like , orotate , citrate , aspartate monohydreate , phosphate dibasic and gluconate . which type should be taken as a supplement and how much ? arthritis , autoimmune diseases , blood pressure , cortisol , greens , hypertension , inflammation , pain , plant-based diets , potassium , psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis , steroids , supplements , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians plant-based diets appear to decrease inflammation via a variety of mechanisms , including boosting our adrenal gland function due to the consumption of potassium rich foods . this is the third of my three video series on potassium this year . check out wednesday 's 98 % of american diets potassium deficient and yesterday ’ s nutritionfacts.org video-of-the-day preventing strokes with diet . i 've got a few other arthritis videos , including preventing arthritis and diet & rheumatoid arthritis . eating healthy doesn 't improve everyone 's joint pain , but as with all nontoxic treatment modalities , they should always be tried first.for some more context , check out my associated blog posts : plant-based diets for psoriasis , plant-based diets for fibromyalgia , and mushrooms and immunity
PLAIN-2829	unsweetening the diet the third way artificial sweeteners may counter-intuitively lead to weight gain involves maintaining the cravings of , and dependency on , all things sweet . by continuing to consume any sweeteners — with or without calories — we are unable to train our flavor preferences away from intensely sweet foods . its like if you go on a low salt diet , for the first few weeks everything tastes like cardboard until your taste buds have a chance adapt to the new norm . after that , natural low sodium foods tastes perfectly fine and adding table salt tastes gross because it ’ s way too salty . same thing with the sweeteners . at home maybe you use erythritol — that 's great , but then you go on vacation and what if you forget it at home ? you still take your preference for intensely sweet food with you and that may end up translating into the increased consumption of less than healthy foods . so those are the caveats even for something nontoxic like erythritol . it ’ s safe , but only you don ’ t use it as an excuse to eat more junk food . does this include high fruit intake ? fruits should not be put at the same level as added sugars . fruits are indeed very healthy and we should eat plenty of them.i ’ m salivating just looking at those donuts … i agree . the photo is making me want donuts ( or doughnuts , as we write in canada ) .now i ’ m thinking about the donut shop across the street . why did i read this ? : ) lol , i think y ’ all are proving dr. greger ’ s point : ) your brain is making you want donuts . someone might be addicted to sugar.eat teenty bananas a day and tons of other fruits and you won ’ t crave doughnutzzdr . greger – could you comment on the benefits , if any , of eating sacha inchi seeds ( also called savi seeds ) . they are being touted for their omega 3 content . are the claims justified ? hi itsme , have you eaten sacha inchi seeds before ? i haven ’ t just yet , but am certainly curious . you asked dr. greger whether the hype surrounding their omega-3 content is warranted . if i may , research confirms that sacha inchi seeds wield an impressive 6 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per serving , comprising approximately 50 % of their fat content . and since omega-3 fatty acids promote health in myriad ways , sacha inchi seeds will compliment the 250 mg of microalgae-based dha that dr. greger recommends daily . let me know if you try them , as i ’ ll be interested in whether you enjoy their taste.but how much omega 6 is present . i ’ ll stick with the flaxif it comes from a plant , eat it . if it ’ s made in a plant , don ’ t eat it.i highly recommend date-almond rolls , which are now available in most grocery stores . it ’ s just whole fruits and nuts + fun.if date-almond rolls are available at most grocery stores is it safe to guess they are made with refined ( bleached ) flour ? hi dr greger . i have suffered from chronic fatigue for many years of my life ( since my teens ) . i have also always been a big sugar addict . i ’ ve been vegan for about 10 months now and am disappointed to find i still suffer from the chronic fatigue . so i have decided to give up refined sugar and processed foods in the hopes that it will help me . i am also hoping to lose a bit of the “ chub ” i carry around my middle . but i ’ m confused about fruit – i read a lot of information online stating that fructose is bad on the liver and contributes to weight gain . i know that fruit is the natural form of fructose , but a lot of people seem to say if you ’ re giving up sugar because of addiction reasons , you should steer clear of fruit as well . i ’ m quite torn about this because i love having my dr fuhrman vege / fruit smoothie in the morning for breakfast and i know fruit is full of nutrients that my body can thrive on . but is fruit consumption sabotaging my attempts to get over my sugar addiction and lose my excess fat ? are there certain fruits ( e.g. dates ) that i should cut out completely ? i often use dates to make raw vegan sweet treats on the weekend . any help much appreciated ! thank you for such a helpful and informative website ! according to another video from dr. greger , dates are fantastic ! see : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / are-dates-good-for-you / have you had your thyroid checked ? craving sweets , fatigue , cold hands and feet are possible warning signs . i learned this from dr. kripps of kripps pharmacy in vancouver . he is 90 and still works one day a week at the pharmacy . take a look at his video about thyroid at the bottom of this page : krippspharmacy dot comhe also wrote a book on this topic . good luck , chelsea ! have you had your thyroid checked ? sugar craving and fatigue can point to a problem there . iodine can help with this . see dr. greger ’ s video about vegan and omnivore vitamin deficiencies.i first learned about the thyroid symptoms from stephen kripps of kripps pharmacy ( krippspharmacy dot com ) in vancouver . he ’ s 90 , full of life and very knowledgable in how to stay healthy . their line of supplements was recommended to me by a nutritionist in the u.s.xylitol ; could you comment more on the sweetner xylitol ? i ’ ve used it and from what i read , it ’ s really good but i can only read what the seller has to say . is it as good as it sounds ? dr. greger recommends to stay away from xylitol because it draws water out of the large intestines which leads to diarrhea and possibly dehydration.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / a-harmless-artificial-sweetener / erythritol on the other hand is neutral and may even have antioxidant like properties.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant / i agree . not everything has to be sweet . sweet and salty often mask the myriad of other flavors . my favourite sweeteners are fruits . when i want something sweeter , i use dates.i ’ ve been taking date sugar with me in a sandwich bag when i go on trips . i ’ ll do the same with this stuff . i went to meet my wife ’ s biological family and when i pulled ripened bananas and dates from my bag , i got smiles from all around . love knows best. artificial sweeteners , caloric restriction , calories , erythritol , fat , junk food , obesity , overeating , salt , sodium , sugar , sweeteners , weight loss all sweeteners--natural and artificial , caloric and non-caloric — help maintain cravings for intensely sweet foods . the other two mechanisms by which low calorie sweeteners could counterintuitively lead to weight gain were explored in wednesday 's and yesterday ’ s nutritionfacts.org video-of-the-day . if one is able to maintain a healthy diet at home and away , though , then there may be no dietary downside to moderate erythritol consumption . see erythritol may be a sweet antioxidant . just remember that though most erythritol is absorbed before it reaches the large colon , a small precentage remains , so if you eat sufficiently large amounts you can indeed trigger the osmotic diarrhea seen more commonly with the non-absorbed sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and xylitol.for some context , please check out my associated blog post : how to gain weight on diet soda
PLAIN-2839	side-effect of fenugreek consumption cancer prevention is all well and good , but there is a side-effect of fenugreek seed consumption , it makes your armpits smell like maple syrup . “ analysis of human male armpit sweat after fenugreek ingestion . and yes , it happens to women too . “ in this study , the strong ‘ ‘ maple-syrup ’ ’ odour which appears after fenugreek ingestion was investigated . ” they had men plaster some guaze pads into their armpits before and after eating a tablespoon of fenugreek seeds , “ sweat was collected over a 24 hour period , and given to a panel of 8 , odor assessors to get their take . they described what they smelled as cocoa , roast beef , carrots . … spicy. gravy , honey rose and lilac , peach-like , raspberry . i guess it could be worse . there was one assessor who described one of the fenugreek odor compounds as musty sweet onion socks . another agreed , but thought it more like fruity floral socks . of course there was the boring assessor who was like , uh , smells like fenugreek . this is a harmless phenomenon ; the only reason i bring it up is that there is actually a serious congenital disorder , called maple syrup urine disease , branched-chain ketoaciduria . it 's completely unrelated but breastfeeding infants with mom ’ s using fenugreek to boost their milk production may be misdiagnosed . so if you 're pregnant or breastfeeding and eating fenugreek , make sure to tell your ob just so they don 't worry . how much fenugreek , and in what form , is most efficient for increasing strength , then ? study sited in yesterdays video use 500 mg / day of a standardized extract ( to 70 % of some frenugreek component or other ) i have been using it for years to heal my colitis . i buy the seeds from an indian store , i found that the organic kind was not as potent . put a tbls in 2 cups of water to soak over night , in the morning add warm water and drink it . it is very strong so you may want to add , raisins or honey . the seeds expand and you can eat them with soup , yogurt or on their own.hey , i like the smell of maple syrup ! does fenugreek increase breast size ? or is that a myth ? no it does not . it does help to produce breast milk for breast feeding moms.yes , it does help with the production of milk , but fenugreek is bad for infants and kids . there are many cases where babies have gone unconscious from it , as well as bad stools and other side effects.in a cup of coffee , with cocoa powder.sweet stuff ! aha ! fenugreek is the base for the condiment “ hilbe ” , a yemenite jewish garnish that is spread on pita or added to soups . i can buy hilbe at the shuk at my favorite pickle-n-olive shop . the yemenite jewish community has known for ages that hilbe can lower blood sugar , its ability to improve muscle strength and having the potential to fight cancer are two more good reasons to add it to your diet.have there been any studies with fenugreek & its effect on women ’ s strength-building ? there are none sadly , and this is one of the only studies of its kind . although i wouldn ’ t doubt that a similar affect would be seen with woman as with men.i ’ ve been adding powdered or freshly ground fenugreek seeds to sweet potatoes or winter squash , often with other curry spices such as turmeric , coriander , cinnamon , ginger , or cayenne . the maple-ish flavor of the fenugreek goes well with the sweetness of those vegetables , and their sweetness counters the fenugreek ( or turmeric ) bitterness.i want you to cook for me … mmmm ! do you bake and mash with the spices ? would love to try it.great culinary tip for us fenugreek newbies ! thx ! fenugreek is something i discovered by becoming a vegan , and i am so glad . i love to toast it , add some oil , garlic , paprika and soy sauce , then add in steamed potatoes . it is de-lish ! and now i learn it is anti-cancer . woo hoo ! ooo ! another great tip that i cannot wait to try ! this is so , so , so interesting ! thank you to those people who commented on this video about how you use fenugreek . i needed some ideas . thanks ! that is a great side effect ! a natural deodorant of sorts . how about a recipe for the chia mango treats ? : ) i ate neatly two tablespoon of fenukgreek seeds during first trimester of pregnancy .. do i need to take any thing to reduce its impacts .. please response my query asapfresh fenugreek greens ( not seeds ) can be used along with parsley and cilantro with beans ( pinto or red beans ) onion and garlic to make a good tasty stew . fresh fenugreek can be found in persian stores ( it is called shambaleleh ) . you can easily grow your own by planting some of the seeds ! we also grind the seeds and add to bread when we bake bread where it adds a nice rich flavor.sounds yummy ! and , judging by the recent video about sprouts , i bet you those sprouted fenugreek greens have even more antioxidants . now , i need to find me a persian store in town . i gotta try that stew ! do you have a more exact recipe or a name for the stew so that i can search it on the net ? hi dr greger . how do you eat your fenugreek powder ? i have tried a few recipes so far and none have been good . it ’ s strong stuff . thankshope you don ’ t mind me chiming in . ; - ) you could probably use powdered fenugreek in the recipes shared by herehere and j potter above . i got a bit experimental myself . since viewing this video i rushed out to get some powdered fenugreek at an awesome co-op in town . i ’ ve been adding it to my coffee , homemade chai tea , and most recently to a modified sweet carrot salad inspired by a _ forks over knives _ recipe ( p . 109 ) .for my homemade chai , i usually use whatever spices i have . these days its whole cloves , powdered cinnamon , powdered allspice , crushed cardamom pods , fennel seeds , ginger ( raw or powdered ) , and now powdered fenugreek . i don ’ t measure these ingredients out so , if you need exact measurements i recommend hitting up your preferred search engine for a more concise recipe . but what i do is add water to a pot , throw in some tea bags ( green , oolong , jasmine , peppermint , you can use whatever you like or have ) , then i add the spices i have , i let that boil and steep for a few minutes . then , i pour the tea mixture through a fine mesh sieve to separate out all the floaties . i add a bit of soy milk to the mix and a touch of sweetner . viola , chai tea with a bit o ’ fenugreek.for the modified sweet carrot salad inspired by a _ forks over knives _ recipe you will need : 5-7 shredded carrots , 2 peeled and diced apples ( or leave the peel on if the apple if it is organic ) , 1 tbs of hibiscus tea ( recipe called for apple juice , but the tea is all i had ) , juice of 1 lemon , 1 / 2 tsp of powdered cinnamon , 1 / 2 teaspoon of powdered fenugreek , 1 / 4 teaspoon of powdered ginger , and 1 / 2 cup of trader joe ’ s golden berry blend ( golden raisins , cherries , cranberries , and blueberries ) . mix and chill for about 1 hour . i thought it was pretty good and was exactly what i needed to satisfy my sweets craving tonight.i imagine you could also add a bit of the powdered fenugreek to your smoothie or oatmeal mixture as well.i gotta tell you , though , this video tells no lie . just the few days of sprinkling powdered fenugreek in my food and i can already smell the difference . will have to see if the muscle mass follows suit . : ) thanks ! : ) how much fenugreek should you consume a day ? i am a body builder and would like to improve my muscle mass and strength . i have been taking about a tablespoon or so a day ( ground ) since watching the video . today i realized that despite a spin ride , sweating a lot and forgetting to put on deodorant- there was no body odor that i could detect.i don ’ t think it smells like maple syrup at all ! it smelled like urine to me when my husband started taking it ! i asked him to stop because the stench was so pungent and made me sick . before we figured out it was the fenugreek , i thought he ’ d stopped washing his hands after using the bathroom ! yikes ! your post made me think , what if what i smell as maple syrup smells like urine to someone else ? that is entirely possible.my wife is now forbidding me to eat fenugreek . she doesn ’ t like that i have a new smell : ) i bought some fenugreek capsules to start taking , and i noticed on the side it warns against taking while pregnant . what ’ s with that ? and is it so dangerous that i should stop taking it even while trying to conceive ? i believe there was some concern it may induce labor.i ’ ve been milling fenugreek seeds for about three days now and adding about a tablespoon to my pre-work out shakes . not only have i started to notice the strength increase but my arm pits totally smell like maple syrup ! win ! i think i would rather have armpits that smell like maple syrup , then cancer anytime … … .. get real . i take fenugreek for $ 500 alex ! ! ! ! i was told fenugreek is pretty much a cure all . i have a dr appt on the 8th for anal fissures that wont heal , would you recommend using this . i have read it helps with inflammation and digestion health . part of the reason it wont heal is hard stools from my specific diet i have to be on . this pain is horrible and i need something to help get me through ! ! ! if fenugreek seeds expand when placed in water , does it expand when digested ? just curious , i have cardiomyopathy and i ’ m overprotective about everything internalized.yes they absorb water and expand ! how about you just take a 3 / 4 tea-spoon full of fenugreek in morning then drink on cup of water after that . this might suppress the bad odor . oozyi ’ ve been taking a total of 1200 milligrams of fenugreek seed extract a day and my ankles and knees swelled up after 3 days of taken. does anybody know of this as being a side effect ? ? i like soaked fenugreek seeds but stopped eating them when i read that hormone sensitive breast cancer patients should not eat them . is this true ? much tastier way to decrease blood sugar and cholesterol levels . less drug side effects.my wife cants stand the smell … said it emanates from my pores . i was wondering if anybody had tried mixing with baking soda or something to deodorize the fenugreek / methi seed powder ? i love cinnamon as well and add it to smoothies and such so was thinking possibly blending this together with the methi . any suggestions / discoveries ? how about fresh fenugreek ? can u please suggest me .. can i consume fenugreek seeds as im effected with bells palsyre : bells palsy . some procedure may help . self : dealing with bouts of trigeminal neuralgia . found in my “ high ” state of pain ( and much research ) a chiropractic method : subtle manipulation . google : nucca , put in your postal / zip code to find the closest to you . it is expensive but helped in my case.good luck.so eating the seeds wont make my pits stink like maple syrup ? and i will make gainz in the gym ? i made an very yummy fenugreek tea today . added apple juice for a third of the tea ( with the water ) , cinnamon , cloves , and a couple teaspoons of sugar . tastes like apple pie ! there ’ s a great persian stew called gormeh sabzi that uses fenugreek leaves . i ’ ve loved it ever since i first tried it . the recipe also uses dried lime balls and kidney beans . i ’ ve never had it without lamb or beef but i bet it would be great without . they serve it with crunchy rice called tadiq … my favorite preparation is http : / / foodviva.com / curry-recipes / methi-bhaji-methi-sabzi / also , my daughter loves http : / / southindianvegrecipes.com / wheat _ recipes / methi _ chapathi.html even though she doesn ’ t have much interest in eating vegetables otherwise . you could probably make these recipes without oil or limited oil.fenugreek leaves cooked with finely chopped onions + tomato + garlic tastes yummy with bread / roti … .you can grate cheese into the sandwich too. body odor , breast milk , breastfeeding , fenugreek , infant formula , infants , maple syrup , pregnancy , side effects , spices , women 's health fenugreek seeds may protect against cancer and improve muscle mass , but they can make your armpits smell like maple syrup . make sure you see the " prequel " to this video benefits of fenugreek seeds . what happens to armpit odor of those embracing entire diets full of plants ?

PLAIN-2849	protein and heart disease we know that the quality and quantity of fat is tightly correlated with the risk of our number one killer , heart disease , but what about protein ? out of harvard recently : “ dietary protein and risk of ischemic heart disease in middle-aged men . independent of source , and independent of fat , do you think total protein intake was associated with more heart disease , less heart disease , or no difference . and the answer they found was , no difference . the quantity didn ’ t seem to matter , but what about the quality ? the source of the protein ? “ we observed no association between [ total ] dietary protein and risk of total ihd in this group of men . however , higher intake of animal protein may be associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease in “ healthy ” men , meaning those without hypertension , high cholesterol or diabetes , healthy only in quotes though given their higher risk of heart disease due to their consumption of animal protein.they also “ observed a significant inverse association between higher vegetable protein intake and risk of fatal heart disease . ” meaning the more plants and less animals one eats would appear to be better for the heart even independent of the fat issue . so the benefits of a plant-based diet may extend beyond just avoiding saturated animal fat.but isn ’ t protein just protein , though ? how does your body know if it ’ s coming from a plant or an animal ? well , proteins are made of a string of amino acids , and the there are some amino acids more common in plants than in animals , particularly glutamic acid , which a study published in the journal of the american heart association was found , for example , to potentially “ have independent blood pressure-lowering effects , which may contribute to the inverse relation of vegetable protein to blood pressure , " meaning high plants , low pressure.their data “ generally reinforce current recommendations for a high intake of vegetable products as a part of comprehensive nutritional / lifestyle approaches to preventing and controlling major established cardiovascular risk factors and epidemic cardiovascular disease . ” thank you ! so , do you think that saturated fat , as utilized in studies , is just a marker for animal protein intake ? reason i ask is the issue of cow ’ s milk ghee in ayurveda . has saturated fat , but no animal protein . anecdotally , practitioners in india ( no formal studies i could find ) are reporting reversal of coronary artery blockage when patients move to an essentially vegan diet , but uses ghee instead of vegetable oils .. given that ayurveda was geared towards the promotion of longevity , would be interested to hear your thoughts.just curious , not trying to be confrontational , but how does ghee not have animal protein if it is from cow milk ? thanks ! since it is clarified ( separated ) , the milk solids and moisture are removed , leaving only the fat part of the butter behind . the solids that are removed constitute the protein , whereas the fat contains , well … fat ! : ) incidentally , ghee contains 8 mg of cholesterol per teaspoon , according to wikipedia . o _ oagreed . also has a ton of vitamin k2 . i ’ m interested in looking at this a bit further , given the huge role ghee plays in a traditional ayurvedic diet . ayurveda was geared towards promoting longevity , so i assume they would ’ t recommend an agent if it was disease causing . however , the mechanism needs to be clarified ( no pun intended ) .i was thinking the same . i can ’ t believe for example that coconut products would cause health problems.coconut milk and oil are indeed unhealthy as they contain a very high saturated fat content.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-coconut-milk-good-for-you / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-coconut-oil-good-for-you / wrong . sorry , that ’ s just plain wrong . not all saturated fats are the same . coconut oil does not contain the long-chain fats found in animal products or lard . medium chain fatty acids , mcfa ’ s , are good for you . they don ’ t go into your fat cells , but straight to the liver where they are converted into energy ( without sugars or carbs … good for diabetics ) . the health benefits of coconut oil are numerous , well researched , and documented . i don ’ t have room here to list them all , but you can find them . do a little research. http : / / www.livestrong.com / article / 261372-coconut-oil-nutrition-facts / i prefer to rely on the available science rather than look at articles on the internet . what you are suggesting about coconut oil is false.coconut oil does indeed contain medium chain fatty acids and this may be metabolized differently but there are very few studies to make the conclusion that coconut oil is “ ok ” or that medium chain saturated fats are negligible . a tablespoon of coconut oil has about 11.7 grams of saturated fat. about 8 grams of this is medium chain saturated fat and about 3.7 grams of this is long chain saturated fat . we have an abundance of evidence concluding that that long chain saturated fats are harmful so we cannot consider this oil a healthy option based on that alone.as far as minerals and vitamins go , there is not one significant vitamin or mineral in coconut oil . the only vitamin present in a tablespoon of coconut oil is .1 micrograms of vitamin k which does not even register as a percentage of daily value . its also absent of any omega 3 fats . just looking at coconut oils nutritional profile we see that it is clearly a junk food . junk food is by definition empty calories. http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / fats-and-oils / 508 / 2the available science on the oil is limited and does not really support coconut oil as a “ superfood ” .the evidence to prove its health benefits are scant.only 1 study on weight loss : forty obese women cut their food intake by 200 calories a day and exercised four days a week . half of them used two tablespoons of coconut oil ( about 240 calories ’ worth ) every day in their cooking and half used soybean oil . after three months , both groups had lost the same amount of weight , about two pounds. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19437058only 1 poorly concluded study with very mixed results on alzheimers : placebo and coconut oil consumers scored no different on a cognitive impairment test when the subjects were randomized . if they weren ’ t randomized ( which could represent stacking up the placebo group with very sick patients ) then the coconut fat consumers scored slightly better after 45 days in the study . after 90 days though everyone pretty much evened out in cognitive improvement which does not show any real gain. http : / / www.nutritionandmetabolism.com / content / 6 / 1 / 31only 1 old study done to “ support ” heart disease : “ in the only study done in people in the last 17 years , malaysian researchers last year found that when they fed young men and women 20 percent of their calories from coconut oil for five weeks , ldl ( “ bad ” ) cholesterol was 8 percent higher and hdl ( “ good ” ) cholesterol was 7 percent higher than when the participants were fed 20 percent of their calories from olive oil ” just because both bad cholesterol and good cholesterol went up does not mean that coconut oil is protective against heart disease and it does not at all mean its healthy . this doesn ’ t make good sense. http : / / www.ajcn.org / content / early / 2011 / 10 / 26 / ajcn.111.020107after looking through the livestrong article , the only support of evidence are opinions of a couple doctors from oprah . the opinions of doctors do not count as science . the only study that the livestrong article posts is the one i discussed about weight loss which is not significant.i do use coconut oil … … .i love it ! mollyhorn gave a great answer … ghee is casein and lactose “ free ” colin campbell told us almost 8 years ago that a similar relationship between animal and plant protein exists in relation to cancer . this is more reason to avoid animal protein.i love protein too , just plant protein . just imagine how strong you can become eating plants and how healthy you ’ ll be . look at the fantastic pic below of one of the greats billy simmonds.just like windows 8 . have to change things up to keep me thinking . ( argh ! ) please don ’ t start charging for your changes , i truly appreciate what you do , and all for free ! here , here ! this website is a true public service ! do you think soy ( namely in the form of edamame beans , tempeh , or tofu ) or quinoa would yield similar results since they are high quality proteins ? tofu also has a comparably higher amount of saturated fat for being a legume ( food ) .dr. greger , this seems to imply that adding msg to one ’ s meal of animal protein would make it more like plant protein , and possibly confer the benefit of lowering blood pressure . however , i suspect the amounts of msg added to food in a typical chinese restaurant , for example , would greatly exceed the proportion found in plant protein.i am happy to eat less meat or no meat at all . it ’ s been nearly half a year now . i question why nutrition studies are done on men only . don ’ t women get heart disease too ? knowthyfood.com stated that “ after researching these products , my understanding is that they both contain high quantities of the amino acid glutamate , which has the same toxic effect as msg described in excitotoxins : the taste that kills written by dr. russell blaylock . ” what are your thoughts on nutritional yeast and other yeasts such as autolyzed yeast added to many foods ?

see cdc report on environmental chemical exposure , the first in this video series on our dietary exposure to industrial pollutants . there ’ s better ways to lower the levels in our bodies than liposuction — in monday ’ s nutritionfacts.org video-of-the-day i ’ ll explore the food sources of flame retardant chemicals . in the meanwhile please feel free to check out any of the other 1,000 + covered topics.if you haven ’ t yet , you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here.interesting and disturbing simultaneously ! before i watched the ending i guessed that new yorkers would have the highest flame retardent levels because of 911 . i don ’ t know if this is why but it probably added to the breast burden.it ’ s pretty clear that living in america puts one at increased risk for toxic exposure ! we ’ re even the country that allows the most gmo ’ s to be fed to our kids , grand kids , friends , relatives , parents , and ourselves . enough already ! ! ! lets start being informed on at least some of the toxin ’ s that are in our food such as bt ( bacillus thuringiensis ) toxin and round up weed killer – both of which are in nearly all the corn , soybean and canola oil which is about 90 % gmo . vote yes , yes , yes on proposition 37 if you live in california.and buy organic if possible to minimize exposure to these harmful chemicals.tell the world we ’ ve had enough already ! ! ! i love this video series but it makes me sad because of the disturbing reality of it all ! ; - ( if fish is one of the worst sources and japanese people tend to eat a lot of fish , why are they the lowest on the scale ? ok … .that is sad . could it be partly due to the increased adipose tissue americans carry ? and , adipose tissue is full of toxins ? it is so important to limit exposure as much as possible . keep a chemical free yard , use glass , stay away from processed foods , buy organic , grow your own.and yes dr. hemo , hope proposition 37 passes because “ as california goes , so goes the rest of the country . ” the authors of the cited study provide the following explanation as to why they chose breast adipose tissue : “ adipose tissue is the preferred tissue to measure steady state concentrations of lipophilic contaminants such as pbdes and pcbs accumulated over time since measurements in breast milk or serum may be affected by surges in blood lipids ( [ archibeque-engle et al . , 1997 ] and [ petreas et al . , 2004 ] ) and may be biased . ” ( see discussion section , paragraph 1 ) very interesting . and such a comment on american society and priorities.the quantities vary so greatly by us state that it can ’ t be just diet . what about air-dropped fire retardants used against wildfires ? another candidate might be the much higher air pollution resulting from more temperature inversions in the cali-fornia ( hot desert ) climate.also , fire retardant fabrics from furniture , carpets and building materials , tend to leach more in warmer average temperatures.does anyone have any established theories on why ca is so bad ? and why us new york worse ? yes , by all measures of air pollution ca easily beats nyk and it has more wildfires and more inversions , so these variables can ’ t be the biggest factor by a long way . whatever would seem to differentiate the us from other countries seems to work in reverse between these two states . i hope we are going to get an answer.someone has suggested that it ’ s building materials and furniture that contain halogenated fire retardants that is the real problem . they are more widely used in the us than elsewhere and ca has more stringent controls than nyk . it ’ s frightening stuff . seehttp : / / greensciencepolicy.org / sites / default / files / janssen-frd-presentation01-09.pdfthe discussion section of the source article provided key insights as to why these flame retardants ( i.e. pbdes ) are so high in california , namely : ” pbde levels in house dust from california were 4 – 10 times higher than previously reported in north america and pbdes in serum of california residents were nearly twice those of the general us population ( zota et al . , 2008 ) , consistent with california ’ s flammability standard and the presumed high use of flame retardants . ” ( from the discussion section , paragraph 2 ) ironically , dr. greger cites the one paper that shows no association between flame retardants ( i.e. pbdes ) and diet . to wit : “ our findings of no association between diet and pbde levels is inconsistent with an emerging literature demonstrating modest associations between pbde body burden levels and consumption of meat , poultry ( fraser et al . , 2009 ) and dairy ( wu et al . , 2007 ) . ” ( from the discussion section , paragraph 4 ) any chance you could tell us , your canadian readers , where we fit in ? i wasn ’ t able to find studies on canadians however based on studies so far on other populations it is mainly depends on what you eat … unless you have other exposures such as industrial , community exposures ( i.e industrial plants , water ) and / or household products . hopefully the standard “ canadian ” diet ( cad ) is better then the standard “ american ” diet ( sad ) .i wonder why dr. greger does not tell everyone that there is already a cure for cancer , and it was found by dr. max gerson ( who fled nazi germany ) in the 1920 ’ s . the gerson cure for cancer should be known by everyone ! please , dr. greger , tell the american public about this . dr. gerson collected thousands of patient case files , and he has developed a cure for many types of cancer as well as certain other diseases . for example , he successfully treated dr. albert schweitzer ’ s family with his cure , which allows the body to heal itself using the potent chemicals found in fresh fruits and vegetables . check out dr. gerson ’ s therapy on the internet ! i have some videos on gerson coming up ( see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2012 / 10 / 11 / vol-11-nutrition-dvd-now-available-proceeds-to-charity / ) . unfortunately the available data doesn ’ t support its efficacy.simply , because according to current empirical data and evidence to date , sadly , there is no cure for cancer . hyperthyroidism in cats is being diagnosed much more frequently compared to just a couple of decades ago . pbde exposure has been implicated.arlene blum , a famous mountaineer , has a compelling mountaineering / flame retardent slide show presentation . in the 70 ’ s she got flame retardent pulled from children ’ s pajamas . now she ’ s working hard to get flame retardent removed from furniture . the pbde industry is almost criminal . belgium , california , china , czechoslovakia , fibroids , flame-retardant chemicals , france , industrial toxins , japan , liposuction , new york city , pbdes , persistent organic pollutants , singapore , spain levels of flame retardant chemical pollutants ( pbde ) in the tissues of women from around the world are compared . i covered pbde 's previously in flame retardant chemical contamination and the problem with organic salmon . how contaminated are americans in general ? see cdc report on environmental chemical exposure , the first in this video series on our dietary exposure to industrial pollutants . there are better ways to lower the levels in our bodies than liposuction — in monday 's video-of-the-day i 'll explore the food sources of flame retardant chemicals . in the meanwhile please feel free to check out any of the other 1,000 + covered topics.for some context , please check out my associated blog posts : pollutants in californian breast tissue , protecting our babies from pollutants , and why are children starting puberty earlier ?
PLAIN-2869	good grub : the healthiest meat thanks to the chinese space program , scientists in beijing recently published a formal nutritional analysis of what may be the healthiest animal to eat . “ “ the nutritional value of insects for human consumption during deep space flights . ” more arginine that soybeans . more zinc than pumpkin seeds . more protein than even snail meat . the selling point , though , is their low saturated fat content . especially when they 're baked , not fried . and one pound of powdered worms gets you all the vitamin b12 you need for the day . “ could an african caterpillar be the new beefsteak ? “ just 3 and a half ounces of caterpillars can provide all of an adult ’ s recommended daily protein , along with iron , b vitamins , and other essential nutrients . ” and they ’ re efficient . whereas we waste about 90 % of nutrients when we feed grains to cows , less than half the nutrition of edible plants is wasted when we route them through bugs.described as a “ an endless source of protein , ” but how do they taste ? they are considered highly nutritious and also have a quote unquote pleasant taste . what exactly so they taste like ? “ people have said that the taste of the beetles is varied ; just to compare it something everyone ’ s familiar with they reported their similarity to octopus . ” a pound a day of powdered worms ? there are safer and cheaper sources of vitamin b12 . what about arginine ? worms , whales , pork rinds and what else ? see fat burning via arginine . sourcing protein from plants may still be preferable , despite what the paleo diet folks assert . that appears to be the direction the american space program is going . what are the downsides to eating insects , though ? that ’ s the subject of monday ’ s video-of-the-day bug appétit : barriers to entomophagy.if you haven ’ t yet , you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here.not. going . to . happen.if you were raised from birth to eat x foods , i bet you could raise children to eat y foods , which are shown here to be more healthy . there ’ s a slow momentum pushing for insect-eating now because it ’ s more nutritious and sustainable.agreed. and in that vein , some “ foods ” are rejected because one was not reared on them . the sustainablity argument is what will probably take hold the most — it ’ s a good angle / justification for people to use.pretty soon you ’ ll find insect pills — it ’ s a much nicer way to consume all the nutrition . i bet the only way you ’ d get people to eat this stuff right now would be to claim it will make you drop 20 lbs in a week without having to exercise . highly-processing it would be a bonus.dr. greger , has your definition of healthy changed recently ? does healthy no longer refer to those foods with the highest antioxidant content ? i ask because you didn ’ t state the antioxidant content of insects in this video and that was your previous basis for comparison of all foods . just looking for consistency ! i think dr. greger is using a common idea that something high in protein is heathy- of course , we know for the last series of videos on igf-1 that it isn ’ t , and so , i take dr. greger ’ s comments in this video to be an expression of his unique sense of humor . once in a while he intersperses his educational videos with a good dose of humor by reporting on the unusual side of nutritional science . i ’ m sure he ’ s not seriously suggesting that we eat powdered bugs.lol. of course he ’ s not . unless you ’ re in space perhaps . anyone taking a visit ? he ’ s saying it ’ s healthiest meat , not healthy necessarily.plants good . meat bad . bugs better than regular meat . … or oven-baked tarantula.guest : i am not as sure as you that bugs are off the menu.entomophagy is a serious business : http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / eating _ insectsperhaps not all bugs are off the menu . read leviticus 11 : 20-25 yum … crunch , crunch ! eewwww.you have made your point with me ! ( if people think that eating animal foods is so good , why don ’ t they actually eat the healthiest animal foods . let ’ s put this animal “ food ” into perspective … ) alas , it sounds like eating those insects is still not going to come close to the health benefits of a plant-based diet . another point of the video . as bcveg pointed out , where are the antioxidants ? ( unless argenine is an antioxidant ? ) and of course , by definition , those insects would not be supplying all those vital phytonutrients . etc . those silly researchers / study that the video was quoting from seem to be focusing on the wrong aspects of health . and they are thinking of sending people into space with that … i don ’ t know about anyone else , but i ’ m not interested in eating a pound of worm powder a day to get my b12 allowance . did you notice how he sneaked that in there ? i think i ’ ll stick around on this planet and eat the plants thank you very much.as suggested by “ guest ” , dr. greger was obvioiusly being facetious with this whole video . though this is highly culture-specific humor . whereas in our culture eating insects is a taboo topic , in many other cultures and at many other times , entomophagy has been considered a valuable source of nutrition.funny that from an environmental and health perspective is probably better to eat insects than to eat the non-human mammals that humans normally consume , since insects are lower down on the food chain.tastes like chicken ! ever smell or taste powdered earthworms ? used in traditional chinese herbology so we had it in my school clinic . all i can say is , “ nasty ! ! ! ! ” maybe some others taste good i don ’ t know . i have had the random bug get chomped in my mouth accidentally while running or biking and they generally are pretty bitter and unpleasant . i think i will stick to kale and beans for now thank you.taking a look into animal fats and saturated fatty acid intake i see no direct correlation between sfa ’ s and chd : http : / / www.nutritionjrnl.com / article / s0899-9007 ( 11 ) 00314-5 / abstract http : / / archinte.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ? articleid = 1108492 http : / / content.karger.com / produktedb / produkte.asp ? doi = 10.1159 / 000229002 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2824152 / interesting . are you aware of any studies where people have had the severity of their chd reduced by adopting a high-saturated-fat animal foods diet ? there are studies that seem to indicate a plant-based diet is capable of this regression of chd.i don ’ t think a high saturated fat diet is taking a moderate approach to nutrition . i do however know of studies showing reduced chd through weight resistance training on a high protein diet while in a caloric deficit . : ) not all saturated fats are equal . this could partly explain why saturated fat isn ’ t always linked with heart disease.among the sfas , stearic acid ( 18 : 0 ) appears to have a neutral effect on ldl-c , while lauric ( 12 : 0 ) , myristic ( 14 : 0 ) , and palmitic ( 16 : 0 ) acids are considered to be hypercholesterolemic. http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 135 / 9 / 2075.fulli think it ’ s better to use a holistic approach and look at meat and dairy instead of isolating nutrients . animal protein , cholesterol , nitrosamines , endotoxins , and saturated fat all play a role in ill health . this can sometimes be difficult to prove in short term controlled studies and long term studies based on questionaires aren ’ t perfect either.fibre , antioxidant and phytosterol intake can mask the effects of saturated fat.even if it ’ s not that bad , which it likely is , you can do better.the paleo diet is thoroughly covered here by dr. greger http : / / atkinsexposed.org / high protein diets are not healthfulthe evidence of the link between saturated fats , ldl and coronary heart disease is overwhelming , despite what a few hand picked studies might suggest . a good review of this is in the video series at http : / / www.plantpositive.com plant positive digs very deep exposing the truth.so mike , are you giving us the “ ok ” to induulge in bbq spiders or should we stick to a meatless diet ? strangely , i haven ’ t seen a lot of proponents of paleo promoting insect consumption … hmm . guess it grosses them out to much . i can ’ t believe that insects didn ’ t play some role in the human diet at that time . i like to season my insects with a little raid ( just kidding ) .dr greger , thank you for being and endless source of inspiration.wanted to ask you something . i like to put peanuts in my morning smoothies . would raw , soaked and / or roasted peanuts be the best option ? i realize roasting would probably get rid of some anti-nutrients , but also ( i suspect ) destroy some efa : s ? keep up the amazing work ! anderscooking would not significantly affect the essential fatty acids but keep in mind peanuts have too much omega 6 and hardly any omega 3 . people are getting too much omega 6 which does not allow omega 3 to synthesize to dha and epa . i would recommend putting walnuts , or ground flax seed in your smoothies instead.keep the ratio of omega 6 : 3 at 4 : 1 or better . peanuts have a ratio of 4400 : 1 which is way off the charts.hilarious synchronicity : yesterday after watching this video , i went to my coop to buy food . they had opened and were asking member opinion on a new “ energy bar ” . it was primarily peanuts and dates and tasted like that but it contained , “ cricket flour for protein . ” no noticeable flavor from the crickets though . wonder what whole a cricket dipped in melted chocolate would taste like ? ? ? ah , thanks for roaching this subject : ^ ) timely , too ! maybe they ’ d be a good treat — or perhaps a trick — for the goblins who will be darkening my door soon . good info on the nutritional content ; looking forward to more of the downfalls . good stuff to know when an entomophagist asks , “ so how much protein should i be getting , then ? ” i love how people are grossed out by bugs , yet don ’ t give a thought about consuming chickens waste products , pus , mucous , various internal organs , eyes , veins , etc. of other animals ; how consuming little kitties is “ horrific , ” yet a baby calf is yum ! i ’ ve told some meat eaters ( who like to argue that we need meat / protein ) that if that ’ s really their concern , they should / would be eating insects . yet , for some reason , that doesn ’ t go over too well.i get enough insect protein from those stubborn enough to stay on the veggies out of my garden … look out bugs . the freegans are out to get yousince do vegans consume any animal life ? i believe this is tongue in cheek . yum , yum renfield ! hmmm . . . different cultures view the eating of insects differently . i guess that explains why when i eat at a chinese restaurant and i point out the fact that there are bugs in my food , the waiters react with disdain for me for reporting it.yuk ! when my dedicated veg ’ n friends say that all the other primate animals are vegetarian . but we know that all the herbivore animals probably get a lot of bugs in their mouth while chomping on the plants . thry certainly can ’ t wash the fruits and veggies . the chimpanzees have created tools so that they can get to bugs . so maybe i should start eating bugs the way my primate ancestors did.hey , thats great , but is there also a kosher ( non bugs ) source of iron ? maybe the # 2 or # 3 on the list ? is there a list ? thanks . guywhole grains and dark leafy vegetables will be the best sources of iron . check out this video on mineral enhancement http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found / bugs bred for comsumption will never have crawled the earth anyway since they will have come from breeding containers . so this superstition driven arguementation needn ’ t be let loose on bugs in packets.in any case you will probably have eaten more ( non kosher ) crawling insects / bugs by unnoticed ingestion than you ’ ve eaten meals in your life . happy dreams.and just if you wondered … .http : / / www.sixfoods.com / not sure why you would suggest that eating another being is acceptable. arginine , b12 , china , insects , iron , octopus , protein , pumpkin seeds , saturated fat , snail meat , soybeans , vitamin b12 , zinc of all animals , the bodies of insects may have the lowest saturated fat content . a pound a day of powdered worms ? there are safer and cheapersources of vitamin b12 . what about arginine ? worms , whales , pork rinds and what else ? see fat burning via arginine . sourcing protein from plants may still be preferable , despite what the paleo diet folks assert . that appears to be thedirection the american space program is going . what are the downsides to eating insects , though ?

PLAIN-2879	how plant-based to lower igf-1 ? just a few days of walking and eating whole healthy plant foods and our igf-1 levels drop low enough to reverse cancer cell growth.what if we stick with it ? going to some pritikin spa and getting healthy for two weeks is one thing , but what about long-term ? does your igf-1 start to creep back up to standard american diet levels again ? no . here ’ s after 11 days , and it just gets better . people eating plant-based for 14 years have half the igf-1 in their bodies , and more than twice the igf binding protein than those on the standard american diet.we know decreasing animal product consumption decreases our igf-1 levels , but how low do you got to go ? how plant-based does our diet need to get ? well , let ’ s look at igf1 levels in meateaters , versus vegetarians , versus vegans.the aim of this study was to determine whether a plant-based diet is associated with a lower circulating level of igf-1 compared with a meat-eating or lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet , and this is what they found . only the vegans had significantly lower levels . and the same relationship found with igf-binding capacity . only the vegans were significantly able to bind up excess igf-1 in their blood streams.this was a study on women … , what about vegan men ? they found the same thing . so even though vegan men tend to have significantly higher testosterone levels , than both vegetarians and meateaters — which can be a risk factor for prostate cancer , the reason plant-based diets appear to reverse the progression of prostate cancer may be due to how low their igf-1 drops.the bottom line … is that male or female , just eating vegetarian did not seem to cut it . it looks like to get a significant drop in cancer-promoting growth hormone levels one apparently has to eliminate animal products altogether . the good news is that given what we now know about igf-1 , we can predict “ that a low-fat vegan diet may be profoundly protective with respect to , for example , risk for postmenopausal breast cancer . ” to review , i started out introducing nathan pritikin ( engineering a cure ) and the elegant series of experiments that became part of his legacy ( developing an ex vivo cancer proliferation bioassay ) . they were able to demonstrate the mechanism by which a plant-based diet and exercise could suppress the growth of breast and prostate cancer cells and protect against prostate enlargement ( more on bph here , and < a href = " prostate versus a plant-based diet “ > specific foods that may help ) . i also asked and answered < a href = " is it the diet , the exercise , or both ? “ > is it the diet , the exercise , or both ? we learned that the cancer promoting growth hormone igf-1 seemed to be the answer to the pritikin puzzle , but why ? what is it about plant-based diets that lower igf-1 levels and increase our body ’ s ability to neutralize igf-1 ? find out in monday ’ s video-of-the-day protein intake and igf-1 production.if you haven ’ t already , you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here.i have a friend who is fighting a bad cancer . is there any way we can get her injections of this binding protein ? i should have asked if it is a good idea first of all . is it ? would it work on post metastatic ( if i ’ m saying that right – it has gone to other locations now ) . i hope you can answer.thanks for your videos , great work ! i have read that capsaicin and soy protein could also raise igf-1 levels in our bodies ( maybe only processed soy or isolated soy protein for the soy part ) . see : http : / / cat.inist.fr / ? amodele = affichen & cpsidt = 19062253 http : / / www.tandfonline.com / doi / abs / 10.1080 / 01635581.2011.579383 http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = mhyfojbu434could you check the latest studies on theses and enlighten us about what is healthy and in which quantities ? thanks fabien for looking up these studies for us . the second one is particularly . it says that the sea weed , alaria esculenta , downgraded the igf-1 producing effect of soy . this could be why asians can get away with eating soy and have such a low rate of cancers- because they also eat sea vegetables which may counter soy ’ s negative effect . hopefully , other kinds of sea vegetables besides alaria esculenta , that is : dabberlocks or badderlocks , or winged kelp from the north atlantic work as well or better . i found the middle link there very interesting . i ’ ve just ordered some wakabe and welsh laver bread to add to my diet . hopefully that will mitiagte somewhat , any increase in igf-1 due to my soya milk consumption.use almond milk , go slow on the soyi found your links interesting . they all talked about isolated soy compounds though , isovlavones in the first study and isolated soy protein in the second . this may not be different from isolating beta carotene and giving it in a vitamin pill only to find out it increased risk of lung cancer . we didn ’ t stop eating carrots after that study ! i was concerned about the soy issue , but like everything else , if eaten as a whole food , minimally processed such soy milk , tofu , tempeh and miso , i think itvhasctrenendous benefits . soy protein burgers , bacon and other highly processed foods are just that . highly processed junk . stay with a whole foods plant based diet and the benefits are great , even with the inclusion of the soy bean . it ’ s a bean.i ’ ve watched a presentation on youtube by dr. mcdougalle about the death of steve jobs in which he adviced againt fake meats and isolated soy proteins . so , i guess one should avoid all proccessed things and eat beans and whole plants unproccessed.agree … go with the beans / veggies … .if you must … go slow on the soy … … soy isolates are not good overall soy protein isolate does in deed igf-1 more significantly than cows milk. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12629084 the differences found between the igf1 level of vegan and non-vegan are small – only 8 % difference ( in males ) . this difference translate to very little risk reduction for cancer . for example , according to this study http : / / cebp.aacrjournals.org / content / 16 / 6 / 1121.long , 8 % lower igf1 is only 3 % less chance of prostate cancer ( * if * the association between igf1 and prostate cancer is indeed casual ) .also , as i noted in other videos , the pritikin diet which is mentioned in the beginning of the video is not vegan or even vegetarian . dt : 3 % less prostate cancer is quite significant in my opinion when you think about the numbers of people who currently get the cancer.according to prospective cohort studies , consumption of dairy is associated with lower rates of colorectal cancer , breast cancer , and cardiovascular diseases , so the benefits of dairy consumption may cancel the risks.interesting. a conclusion that dairy has overall benefits of any kind is the complete opposite of the studies i am aware of . plus it doesn ’ t make sense . if it makes sense to you , go for it.i wonder who funded those studies … ? just a thought . most epidemiological studies are not funded by the industry.most ? ! are you cherry-picking ? i never tried to count the number of industry funded epidemiological studies . if this interest you , you can count how many of the 18 studies appearing in the meta-analysis below were industry funded.http : / / www.springerlink.com / content / b6103055j6051k60 / there are absolutely no benefits to drinking or eating another mammals mammary gland excretions . especially when one 16oz glass of it is loaded with 360,000,000 pus cells ( dead white blood cells ) and over 1,000,000 bacteria . that is what is allowed by law : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22981577also you allow your body a host of exposures to bugs like mycobacterium avium parataburculosis and this wonderful list from cornell university ; http : / / foodscience.cornell.edu / cals / foodsci / extension / upload / cu-dfscience-notes-milk-under-the-microscope-06-10.pdfnothing like a nice tall glass of sterile pus and bacteria . yum ! a great read is joe keon ’ s book whitewash . a sample preview link is provided. http : / / www.barnesandnoble.com / sample / read / 9780865716766also john robbins ( son of baskin & robbins ice cream legend ) has a great read as well , “ no happy cows ” http : / / www.barnesandnoble.com / w / no-happy-cows-john-robbins / 1106932666 ? ean = 9781573245753drinking milk is almost like signing the old song , “ ddt is good for you and me ! ” the cartoon reference from above . see image . the books you cite are not credible sources.i wouldn ’ t normally reply or waste my time with such an ignorant reply . but in defense of the people who spend countless hours , days , weeks , years and lives dedicated to credible research i must speak up . “ not credible sources ” you say . their sources are from journals such as jama , new england journal of medicine , american journal of clinical nutrition , british medical journal , lancet , annals of internal medicine , american journal of epidemiology etc.in whitewash there are nearly 1000 references supporting the evidence that milk is crap , literally and anecdotally.quotes in whitewash : nathan pritikin : “ the most damaging foods are dairy product . ” john mcdougall , md : “ there is one thing dairy products have more than any other food i can think of : contamination.t. colin campbell , phd : “ dairy has been considered a health food , and that ’ s an unfortunate myth . ” benjamin spock , md : “ cow ’ s milk in the past has always been oversold as the perfect food , but we are now seeing that it isn ’ t the perfect food at all and the government really shouldn ’ t be behind any efforts to promote it as such . ” walter willett , md , mph , drph : “ dairy products shouldn ’ t occupy a prominent place in our diet , nor should they be the centerpiece of the national strategy to prevent osteoporosis . ” oh and joseph keon , phd has his doctorate in nutrition.here is a quote by neal barnard , md as you know one of great leaders in the medical nutrition arena : “ most of us grew up with the idea that mild is healthful , if not essential . and yet research has shown a surprisingly different side to dairy products , linking it to a broad range of serious health problems . whitewash takes a comprehensive look at the problems associated with drinking milk and the industry that promotes it . this book has the potential to dramatically change your health . ” regarding no happy cows i will leave that research up to you to discover but here is a wonderful forward from t. colin campbell , phd : “ john robbins connects the dots that need connecting – environmental , personal health , societal economics , and personal meaning . scientific researchers also would do well to read what robbins says . ” i ’ m not sure what you think is credible but these sources surely are , and have the information to change the world for the better . i hope everyone takes the time to read these books and dispell the myths and hype that commenters such as yourself perpetuate.1. while whitewash have references to paper in scientific journals , these papers were probably cherry-picked . the book has not gone through peer review , which makes it a non credible source.2. if nathan pritikin thought that dairy is damaging , why does his diet includes two servings of dairy per day ? your definition of ‘ credible ’ is your own so i do not understand why you waste your time commenting on a “ non-credible ” site such as nutritionfacts.org. please , for your own sake , keep drinking milk . it obviously serves you well . “ all truth goes through three stages . first it is ridiculed . then it is violently opposed . finally , it is accepted as self-evident ” arthur schoepenhauer , german philosopheri don ’ t suppose you cherry pick studies at all . thank you . much appreciated . thanks for the points ! a review published in the journal of pediatrics focused on the benefits of dairy “ the findings of epidemiologic and prospective studies have raised questions about the efficacy of the use of dairy products for the promotion of bone health . ” after a review of the existing literature and finding “ a positive relationship between dairy product consumption and measures of bone health in children or young adults was reported in 1 of 4 cross-sectional studies ; in 0 of 3 retrospective studies ; in 0 of 1 prospective study ; and in 2 of 3 randomized , controlled trials . only 1 of these randomized clinical trials adequately controlled for vitamin d intake , and it showed no significant effect of dairy products on bmd [ bone mineral density ] ” , they concluded , “ scant evidence supports nutrition guidelines focused specifically on increasing milk or other dairy product intake for promoting child and adolescent bone mineralization . ” http : / / pediatrics.aappublications.org / content / 115 / 3 / 736.longa meta-analysis published in the british medical journal found , “ the small effect of calcium supplementation on bone mineral density in the upper limb is unlikely to reduce the risk of fracture , either in childhood or later life , to a degree of major public health importance . ” and “ the authors concluded that the literature did not support recommendations for consumption of dairy products for bone health end points in children and young adults … our quantitative systematic review confirms this conclusion ” the authors also state , “ our results also do not support the premise that any type of calcium supplementation is more effective than another . ” even studies that used intakes of 1400 mg per day of calcium showed no benefit. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1602024 / ? tool = pubmedan editorial accompanying this meta-analysis pointed out , “ populations that consume the most cow ’ s milk and other dairy products have among the highest rates of osteoporosis and hip fracture in later life . given this fact , it is important to ask whether sufficient evidence exists to continue assuming that consumption of these foods is part of the solution . ” they concluded “ it is time to revise our calcium recommendations for young people and change our assumptions about the role of calcium , milk , and other dairy products in the bone health of children and adolescents . while the policy experts work on revising recommendations , doctors and other health professionals should encourage children to spend time in active play or sports , and to consume a nutritious diet built from whole foods from plant sources to achieve and maintain a healthy weight and provide an environment conducive to building strong bones . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1602030 / a review published in the american journal of clinical nutrition of the research on the effects of dairy products on bone health found 57 studies , and of these , 21 studies were considered to have stronger-evidence , worthy of inclusion in this review . “ of 21 stronger-evidence studies , 57 % were not significant , 29 % were favorable , and 14 % were unfavorable . ” keep in mind that the majority of these studies were funded by the dairy industry , and even with this natural bias and influence to produce positive outcomes , no better than 29 % of the studies were favorable to bone health . one of the studies that showed unfavorable results that was funded by the dairy industry showed some shocking outcomes . the findings showed post menopause subjects who received the extra milk ( three 8 ounce glasses of skimmed milk daily ) for a year lost more bone than those who didn ’ t drink the extra milk . the authors wrote , “ the protein content of the milk supplement may have a negative effect on calcium balance , possibly through an increase in kidney losses of calcium or through a direct effect on bone resorption … this may have been due to the average 30 percent increase in protein intake during milk supplementation . ” skim milk is very high in protein so this is unavoidable unless one is to consume the very fatty whole milk in which 2-5 % of the fat content is trans fat and is very high in saturated fat. http : / / www.ajcn.org / content / 72 / 3 / 681.long http : / / www.ajcn.org / content / 41 / 2 / 254.longits evidence such as this that i am unconvinced calcium should be from cows milk . long term studies on vegan bone density comparing the omnivores diet showed the same bone density “ … although vegans have much lower intakes of dietary calcium and protein than omnivores , veganism does not have an adverse effect on bone mineral density and does not alter body composition . ” the vegan participants had been on a vegan diet an average of 33 years. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19350341i find it interesting that modern society believes that the human species is dependent on the milk of another animal species . the primary biologic purpose of cow ’ s milk is to grow a 60 pound calf to a 600 pound cow in less than 8 months . this is no way natural to humans as cow ’ s milk has high concentrations of protein , potassium , sodium , calcium , and other nutrients to sustain rapid growth . in comparison , these nutrients are at a three to four times lower concentration in human milk than cow ’ s milk . milk is used to promote growth , so how is this natural as human adults to be consuming milk , let alone another species of animals milk ? dairy is a heavy promoter of insulin like growth factor in adults . this spike in igf-1 is the most likely source of positive bone growth in the studies showing favorable outcomes of dairy on bones , not necessarily the calcium . elevated igf-1 does more harm than good in adults , it heavily promotes tumor growth in breast , prostate , lung , and colon cells and accelerates the aging process. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12417786 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16168602the consumption of dairy in children has resulted in earlier puberty . “ the effect of animal protein intake , which was associated with an earlier puberty onset , might mainly be due to dairy . “ an earlier puberty onset has been related to an increased risk for hormone-related cancers in adulthood . for example , a meta-analysis of 26 epidemiological studies reported a 9 % risk reduction for breast cancer with every additional year at menarche . additionally , recent study results demonstrated that a 1-y delay in menarche was associated with a 2.4 to 4.5 % lower total mortality. http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 140 / 3 / 565.longthe concern with dairy and hormone dependent cancer is something to think about as well . it has been shown that consuming dairy significantly increases circulating steroid hormones in woman and that vegetarians have far less of this hormone . “ in conclusion , greater consumption of red meat and dairy products might influence circulating concentrations of shbg and estradiol , respectively . given the well-established role of steroid hormones in breast cancer etiology for postmenopausal women , these findings may have important health implications ” tumor growth from these hormone imbalances is also evident “ a dramatic increase in estrogen-dependent malignant diseases , such as ovarian , corpus uteri , breast , testicular and prostate cancers has been recognized . ganmaa et al. investigated the incidence and mortality of testicular and prostate cancers in relation to dietary practices . among various food items , cow ’ s milk and cheese had the highest correlation with incidence and mortality rate of these cancers ” children are at high risk “ among the exposure of humans , especially prepubertal children , to exogenous estrogens , we are particularly concerned with ” these xenoestrogens from lactating preganant cattle ( the majority of commercial cattle used for milk ) significantly raised estrogen levels in male adults and reduced testosterone levels and did even more so in children . this is significant since these estrogens have mutagenic affects “ toxicological and epidemiological studies have indicated that e2 could be categorized as a carcinogen . milk is considered to be a rich source of estrogens . indeed , e2 concentration is higher in mammary drainage than in the peripheral circulation in high yielding cows . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20211044 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19904296 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19496976thanks for the info . i told a vegetarian that cow ’ s milk is nasty . she didn ’ t want to hear it , and said “ oh you ’ re vegan ” . i said something like , “ it has nothing to do with being vegan ; it ’ s nasty no matter what diet we ’ re on . ” dt , what your claiming is complete nonsense.could somebody on your staff please clarify this ? if i recall correctly , the wcrf / aicr meta-analysis ( www.dietandcancerreport.org ) does conclude that dairy is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer , but also says dairy is associated with higher risk of prostate cancer ( perhaps due to high calcium ) and in their latest update , says it ’ s not clear as to association with breast cancer risk . i also recall a discussion somewhere in that report of the galactose in dairy and the possibility of it increasing ovarian cancer risk . could your staff please have a look and inform us ? this video said at .30 that “ people eating plant-based diets for 14 years had half the igfl-1 in their bodies { } . ” that ’ s 50 % less , not 8 % .br j cancer . 2000 jul ; 83 ( 1 ) : 95-7 . mean serum insulin-like growth factor-i was 9 % lower in 233 vegan men than in 226 meat-eaters and 237 vegetarians ( p = 0.002 ) . vegans had higher testosterone levels than vegetarians and meat-eaters , but this was offset by higher sex hormone binding globulin , and there were no differences between diet groups in free testosterone , androstanediol glucuronide or luteinizing hormone.as is common here some careful cherry-pickin ’ going on here.9 % less igf-1 is all groups taken into account . 50 % less is only the 14 years vegan group.you can be vegan for a month and participate in a study ; long term vegans have a 50 % lower levels of igf1 ! these results are astonishing , nothing less . most meat would have to fast 3-4 for days a week to achieve anything similar . you and meledictis are confusing the studies.the study that compared vegan with non-vegan is allen et al 2000 . in this study , the average igf1 level were 18.5 in vegans vs. 20.1 in meat eaters . this is a small difference.the other study is ngo et al 2002 . in this study , people on the pritikin diet + exercise reduced their igf1 levels by 55 % ( compared to their own levels ) in 14 years . however , the pritikin diet is not vegan ! ( and not even vegetarian ) .one of the problems with this study between igf-1 and prostate cancer is that it ’ s a case-control study . in this kind of study , the researchers go through medical records or use some other kind of survey to find say , prostate cancer cases and then they look at their igf-1 levels , which are of course high . then they find a bunch of supposedly healthy subjects who don ’ t have cancer ( that is , not yet ) to use as controls and they check their igf-1 levels too , to see if there are any differences in their igf-1 . and what do they find ? only very slight differences . why ? because the whole population except for the 2 % who are vegan , are on the standard american diet and eat excessive animal protein , which increases their igf-1 and their risk of cancer . not everyone with high igf-1 gets cancer or gets it right away , but close to half of the population will at some point in their life have to cope with cancer- unless they shrink their odds nearly to the vanishing point by going vegan . that ’ s why those who have cancer now have comparable levels of igf-1 to those who don ’ t- because they ’ re all in the same s.a.d. high animal protein boat and eventually , a good number of them are likely to get cancer- and probably diabetes , heart disease and a whole lot of other aliments . want that ? not me ! i ’ m definitely staying vegan.1. the study i cited was a prospective case-control , meaning that the blood sample were taken before cancer was diagnosed.2. the people in the lowest tertile of igf-1 levels in this study had low igf-1 levels : less than 17.8 nmol / l. this is lower than the average levels observed in vegans in ( allen et al 2000 ) .3 . as i wrote before , according to the allen et al 2000 study , the difference between igf1 levels of vegan and meat eaters is small : ( the average level is 18.5 in vegans vs. 20.1 in meat eaters ) . prospective case-control ? that ’ s a new one on me . a prospective study by definition looks at a topic over a long period of time , while a case-control study is a snapshot in time . this was actually a case-control study , derived from data from a larger prospective study . at any rate , this is not the kind of study you want to try to make a case with ; the statistical significance of the results is too small . in other words , although the study seemed to indicate no particular difference ( for reasons as i explained above- a case-control is far from ideal for nutritional studies ) , the poor statistical power they got from this study indicates that the could very well have been by chance and if they repeat the study , they may well get the opposite results next time . by the way , dt , i feel as if every time someone wants to stand up and express themselves , you take a shot at them . keep this up and no one will want to play with you anymore . i like to think of this as a forum where members support and encourage each other and whose comments show respect and encouragement . but i feel that you are violating these unspoken rules of courtesy and graciousness . i ’ d like to request that if you want to continue on this site that you try to be a bit more discrete in your comments.first time here , and no opinion on this nutrition issue.but it seems to , that all the hostility is and pot shots aare being directed at dt , not from dt.and for what ? for presenting the other side of the story ? and doing it without a hint of hostility ! ! how dare he disagree with you all.well this is the closest subject to my question , so here goes . i am 67 year old make and was diagnosed with prostate cancer ( gleason = 8 ) four years ago and immediately switched to a strict vegan nutritional base . i ’ ve been an avid fan of nutrition facts ( post them on my pinterest site daily ) . for the first time i had my igf-1 level checked ( my doctor didn ’ t have a clue as to why ) after reading / hearing about the beneficial impact of a low igf-1 . mine is now 105 ( very low ? ) and my testosterone is over 800 ; just as the doctor ’ s video mentioned ! but is it low enough to combat my prostate cancer ( recent psa = 7 up from 5.8 4 months ago ) ) . most of my blood work is terrific ( hdl = 71 ldl-74 , triglycerides = 38 ) .it is really hard to develop targets for some of these tests and i want to better understand how i should proceed . current literature is all over the place and none / few address prostate cancer and nutrition.tell dr. greger thanks for his guidance.skip steini love the graph with the baby with the baby chick in it ’ s mouth . gotta tell ya that i love your transitions in your presentation and your attention to detail within them . just fantastic baby ! ! ! oh , great info as well ( as always ) ; - } the studies continue to demonstrate that a plant based diet and exercise is a lifestyle we should all strive for ! eat your veggies and fruit and get moving . pretty straight forward … … .i wonder if you could clarify something for me . i drink a lot of soya milk , i like it and have found i have been able to come off hrt since drinking it ( i ’ m post menopausal ) . i watched a dr john mcdougall video on youtube last night where he said that soya milk increased igf-1 to even higher levels than milk from a cow . i ’ m sure i ’ ve seen a video of yours where you said that drinking soya milk was actually beneficial in terms of lower breast cancer rates . in your opinion , is soya milk safe for me to drink or not ? i ’ m in the uk where the soya milk is certified gm free . just to be on the safe side , sue , maybe you should switch to rice , oat , hemp or almond milk . you probably won ’ t have to go back on hrt , now that you ’ re “ over the hump . ” i wasn ’ t terribly impressed with rice milk when i tried it and although i like nut milks they are quite expensive to make . i might have a go at making some oat milk – i hadn ’ t thought of that . soya milk is so much easier to drink because i can buy it in cartons from the supermarket fridge – i will cut down though ( have been getting through up to 2 pints a day some days ) .dr mcdougall actually pinpointed isolated soy protein and not whole soy products such as soy milk . many of his recipes use soy milk and tofu and he said it was safe . it ’ s the processed meat substitutes he cautioned against that were made with isolated soy protein such fake chicken . note that does not include seitan which is made of wheat gluten flour.when dr mcdougall mentioned soya milk i hadn ’ t realised you could get milk made isolated soy protein . the milk i buy is made from hulled soya beans , so thanks for that – makes me feel a bit better.dr. greger covers how much soy is a safe amount in his future videos . as a sneak peak , the safe range is between 3-5 servings . more than that and you risk igf-1 increases.you can see into the future ? is that 3 – 5 servings per day , week or month ? also , how much is a serving ? i have access to the future videos of this volume . 3-5 servings per day of soy , typically , 1 / 2 cup of soybeans or tofu constitutes a serving and 1 cup of soy milk constitutes a serving.excellent , thank you . that really helps.thank you for posting these great videos on igf-1 ! a question i have is do you know if there has been any research done on the effect of eating soy protein isolate on blood levels of igf-1 ? would love to hear your thoughts on this topic . : ) soy protein isolate promotes igf-1 more significantly than cows milk . i would advise staying away from the stuff ! http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12629084ok . now i am worried . i am a 67 year old woman who was diagnosed with low igf-1 2 1 / 12 years ago . i was told i had the level of a 95 year old . an expensive product called secretropin was prescribed – sprayed under the tongue . no one has ever suggested that i be re-tested . i am not a vegan . my primary sympton was excersize intolerance and , although i don ’ t like being dependent on a med and have tried to do without it , i seem to do much better with it . cancer incidence in my family is very low but my mother had severe osteoporosis and other relatives had diabetes . my father had parkinsons . are any of these related to igf-1 ? what causes low igf-1 and what should one do about it ? other than increasing my animal intake , what could i do naturally ? i have no known problems at present except the low igf-1 and low thyroid for which i take naturethroid . i know that you can ’ t diagnose me from this info but a general discourse on low igf-1 would be very interesting . thank you.thank you for posting this fascinating series of videos regarding igf-1 levels . i am a whole-foods , plant-based nutrition / health coach , and decided for the sake of experimentation to see what my levels are as someone following a vegan diet . the healthy range given was 65-250 . my level was 175 . that seemed rather high ( perhaps ? ) for someone who consumes no meat or dairy . is that indeed a high number , and if i ’ m otherwise very healthy , should it be cause for concern ? colon cancer runs in my family , so i ’ m interested in being proactive to decrease my risk . again , thank you for this , and all of your videos , dr. greger.the study that you cite from the british journal of cancer regarding testosterone is very flawed because the average age of the meat eating men in this study is 52 years old , while the vegan population of men ( only 260 men ) is only 42 years old , and the testosterone levels in men decrease substantially every decade after 30 , so i think to report this as fact is incorrect . the levels of the meat eating men is less because they are older and the vegan men levels is higher because they are younger.back-transformed means presented with 95 % ci in parentheses . values are adjusted for age ( in categories of 20 – 29 , 30 – 39 , 40 – 49 , 50 – 59 , 60 – 69 , 70 + ) , smoking status ( never , past , < 10 cigarettes / day , 10 + cigarettes / day ) , vigorous exercise ( < 2 , 2 – 4 5 + hours / week ) , time of day of venipuncture ( < 10 , 10 – 13.29,13.30 + hours ) , time since last meal at venipuncture ( < 1.5 , 1.5 – 3 , 3 + hours ) and time between blood draw and processing ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 + days ) . ainsufficient serum led to igf-i measurement being unavailable in 1 subject , shbg in 9 subjects , t in 20 subjects , ft in 25 subjects , a-diol-g in 5 subjects , lh in 20 subjects and total cholesterol in 8 subjects. bp value is test of heterogeneity.also , vegans had higher testosterone levels than the vegetarians and they were similar ages . other studies have shown similar results.http : / / www.nature.com / bjc / journal / v83 / n1 / pdf / 6691152a.pdf here is the study , see for yourself.are there any figures for people who eat meat but do not consume any produce containing milk ? my interpretation from the 3 sets of figures above is that meat makes very little difference in igf-1 but eliminating the other animal products provides the change . after reading that dwarfs with laron-syndrome have never had a single case of cancer , it ’ s clear that their unique igf-1 levels make the difference . if only we were foccused on igf-1 reducing methods rather than improving the current main stream cancer treatments ( which aren ’ t working so well ) , maybe cancer could be prevented in the first place . with the amount of hormones found in milk products naturally destined for baby cows , it is quite astonishing that as a species we have ( the majority anyway ) accepted milk as being healthy to humans , simply because the people selling it to us told us so ! wake up to dairy . by waking up without it.would be very interesting for me as ( ex ) paleo too . concerning just this study , it seems that meat has no effect on igf-1 , but milk ( and / or eggs ) has.i ’ d love to see your opinion / findings on isolated soy protein in foods . i saw a video somewhere a long time ago showing that soy protein isolate was 4x more potent than dairy at increasing igf-1 levels . i ’ ve been avoiding foods that contain isolated protein ( especially soy ) ever since but haven ’ t been able to find the original video . ( i think it may have been on the vhs.org lecture series ? ) i try to eat primarily whole foods , and my diet is completely plant based . when opportunities come up , i try to share what i ’ ve learned about healthy eating with friends and acquaintances . i ’ ve had many people ask me about soy , and i tell them to avoid the isolated protein , but eating foods made with whole soy beans is fine . i ’ d love to be able to point them toward the evidence to back this . i find many articles / videos on your site about soy in general , but i haven ’ t been able to find one specifically addressing the isolated protein.thanks for all you do ! ( i recently learned that post foods is jumping on the protein bandwagon and has added isolated soy protein to grape-nuts ( and possibly other cereals ) . ) despite being vegan for 24 years , my igf-1 level equals the carnivore level reported here . i eat fewer daily servings of soy than the safe level shown . what other factors might explain my high igf-1 level ? what do you make of this study where vegans didn ’ t have raised t ? http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 2400756here is an interesting link to studies in which they are injecting human placental extract to increase igf-1 as a means of slowing the aging process.http : / / www.agemed.org / ammgejournal / may2013 / shaneuniqueageattenuationstrategymay2013 / tabid / 912 / language / en-us / default.aspxfind strict whole-food plant-based diet people and see the igf-1 binding protein in them , similar to this study . i am one and do physical activity too . i gave this article to a chiropractor , who uses a wholistic process to help people , similar to the wholistic of t. colin campbell.dr. greger , is it any meat that raises igf-1 levels or just meat that ’ s been treated with growth hormones ? arwen : it is my understanding that the igf-1 problem is in the animal protein itself , not the hormones . ( though the hormones can be an added problem . ) hence , any animal protein : flesh , dairy , and eggs is going to raise igf-1 to cancer promoting levels . i ’ m not an expert , but that is how i understand the ifg-1 video series that you see on this site.hope that helps.that is the conclusion drawn on this site , but i haven ’ t seen evidence to support it . since vegetarians and meat-eaters had virtually the same igf-1 levels in the example cited in this video , it appears that eggs and / or dairy ( which commonly contains growth hormones ) may be the culprit and not all animal protein.frasier linde : re : “ it appears that eggs and / or dairy ( which commonly contains growth hormones ) may be the culprit and not all animal protein . ” but eggs do not have added growth hormones . what eggs and diary have in common and what makes sense for the igf-1 issue is the animal protein . i ’ m not saying that added hormones are not problem . i ’ m saying that problems with animal products go way beyond the issue of added hormones.i haven ’ t watched this series in a long time . but if memory serves , the video series does a good job of explaining why the problem is animal protein in general , and not a specific animal product or product ( s ) . i understand you don ’ t find the evidence compelling . i do.re : “ since vegetarians and meat-eaters had virtually the same igf-1 levels in the example cited in this video … ” if i understand your text , you appear to be making an argument that is in favor of the generalization of animal protein = too much igf-1 understanding . both vegetarians and meat-eaters are eating animal protein . and they both have problems with igf-1 levels . it ’ s only after eliminating all animal protein that a person gets their igf-1 levels under control . here is a quote from the video : “ the aim of this study was to determine whether a plant-based diet is associated with a lower circulating level of igf-1 compared with a meat-eating or lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet , and this is what they found . only the vegans had significantly lower levels . and the same relationship found with igf-binding capacity . only the vegans were significantly able to bind up excess igf-1 in their blood streams . ” my parenthetical about growth hormones refers only to dairy . however , eggs and dairy are both much more commonly allergenic and pro-inflammatory than meat or fish . the fact that only the vegans in the study had significantly lower levels of igf-1 could mean that eliminating all animal protein was necessary , or it could mean that eliminating eggs and / or dairy was necessary . without a group eliminating eggs and dairy but not meat and fish , it is inappropriate to draw the conclusion that animal protein is universally problematic from this or similarly designed studies.frasier : fyi : i understood what your parenthetical was referring to . that was my point.is your argument that allergies and / or substances that cause inflammation affect igf-1 production ? i may simply not understand your point , but that doesn ’ t make any sense to me . i feel these videos do a good job of explaining exactly how animal protein affects igf-1 levels . i have never heard of an alergic reaction triggering igf-1 production in the body . it ’ s an interesting thought though . are there studies that link allergies to igf-1 production ? are you claiming that all those vegetarians and omnivores are having allergic reactions to dairy and eggs , but not ( perhaps ) meat ? the allergenic and pro-inflammatory potentials are other things eggs and dairy have in common besides just animal protein — whether those properties affect igf-1 , i don ’ t know . a more striking commonality is that they are both naturally designed to feed growing animals , so it would make perfect sense for them to increase igf-1 levels more than meat or fish . i ’ ll repeat the rest of my last reply , as you seem to have missed it as my main argument : “ the fact that only the vegans in the study had significantly lower levels of igf-1 could mean that eliminating all animal protein was necessary , or it could mean that eliminating eggs and / or dairy was necessary . without a group eliminating eggs and dairy but not meat and fish ( not to mention other uncontrolled factors such as what the animals are fed ) , it is inappropriate to draw the conclusion that animal protein is universally problematic from this or similarly designed studies . ” p.s. the video explains why it * looks like * animal protein affects igf-1 levels , but it doesn ’ t even attempt to address “ how . ” why does that “ movie ” spend so much time showing flying charts etc and so little time with the actual numbers on the chart so someone can read and see whats going on ? blade78 : these videos are meant to be summaries . for anyone who wants to get into the nitty-gritty , you can use a combination of the pause button for the video and / or go directly to the study source . under every video is a section label titled , “ sources cited ” . you can expand that section and follow up with the original studies if you see a topic that particularly interests you.personally , i found the numbers presented in this video ( above the bar charts ) to be sufficient for my needs , and that the flying charts where highly amusing and kept my attention . so , this video worked well for me.good luck.thanks , thea . your comments were helpful.low amounts of igf-1 can cause a lower quality of life and the appearance of being more aged * ie , skin more loose , less elasticity , smaller muscle , weaker bone , slower injury healing , etc ” . igf-1 is one of the major youth hormones in our bodies and many hollywood celebrities and athletes supplement growth hormone ( which is what igf-1 is ) .not everyone is at risk of developing igf-1 cancer tumors . let ’ s get that straight . this article doesn ’ t actually give you the percentage of people who are at risk of those types of cancer.next , if you look at weight lifters who take strong dosages of growth hormone , you don ’ t see really any deaths or side effects . you see men living one hell of a high quality lifestyle . are there risks with higher igf-1 ? for a few unlucky people , yes , they would be at risk of cancer growth . for most people , this is not a risk and they can have high growth hormone levels well into their old ages and get lifestyle benefits from it . the biggest side effect would be an enlarged heart in a small number of people who are taking pro-body-builder levels of growth hormone.don ’ t let articles like this mislead you are ‘ scare ’ you about growth hormone.i don ’ t think anyone would agree that weight lifters are a model of health . these people supplement vast quantities of protein , the diet is not sustainable for a long healthy lifestyle . the igf-1 issue is very real . it does not cause immediate death , it leads to chronic disease . “ in this regard it is of special concern that male adolescents in the fitness and bodybuilding environment consume high amounts ( 60 – 80 g / d ) of leucine-rich whey- or casein-based protein concentrates to gain muscle mass , a procedure which is often associated with the development of acne … it is frightening to realize that more than 85 % of adolescents of western countries exhibit acne , whereas individuals of non-western populations like the kitava are not affected by this disease and other mtorc1-driven diseases of civilization.3,149 this implies that the majority of our western population is living with over-activated mtorc1 signaling , a major pathogenic factor , which probably may pave the way for the development of other serious diseases of civilization ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3408989 / im confused . isnt igf-1 the human growth hormone thats good to stay young etc ?

PLAIN-2889	extra virgin olive oil vs. nuts recently researchers in spain wondered what would happen if they replaced much of the refined olive oil in people ’ s diets with extra virgin olive oil or walnuts , or almonds . what were the effects on people ’ s cardio vascular risk factors after a month on each of the different diets . same people , but three different months diets different only by the main source of fat . and this is what they foundthe people in the nut groups did significantly better , dropping their total cholesterol about 7 % , knocking about 20 points off their bad cholesterol , however the extra-virgin olive oil did do somewhat better than the refined olive oil , presumably because it retains a few more phytosterols , but nuts — and seeds — remain the best source of fat.whole food sources of fats , like everything else , tend to be preferable . one can think of extra virgin olive oil like fruit juice — it ’ s got nutrients , but the calories you get are relatively empty compared to the whole fruit . olives are , after all , fruits . you fresh squeeze them and you get olive juice , less nutrition than the whole fruit , but then it gets even worse , they throw away what ’ s called the olive wastewater , which contains all of the water soluble nutrients in olives so you ’ re really just getting a small fraction of the nutrition of the whole fruit . so why not just eat the olives ? well the problem is that they ’ re soaked in brine such that a dozen olives could take up half your sodium intake for the day , so i suggest eating them only in moderation . adding nuts and seeds to one ’ s salad boosts the bioavailability of the fat-soluble carotenoid phytonutrients in the greens . see my video forego fat-free dressings ? . oil would work , but whole food sources of fat ( and other nutrients ! ) are superior . for more on nuts and cholesterol see nuts and bolts of cholesterol lowering and for more on the adverse effects of too much sodium , see dietary guidelines : with a grain of big salt and salt ok if blood pressure is ok ? i like that juice : oil comparison ! i ’ ve got to remember that one.i went salt free several years ago ; but i still enjoy olives . i eat the raw , whole , no-salt olives . they are ( supposedly ) an acquired taste — either love them or hate them , i guess . i happen to love them . any problem with these ? i ’ ve not heard of any.do sprouted nuts have a greater nutritional value ( as do sprouted seeds and beans ) vs raw nuts ? would this help kick the salad up a notch ? for the people who need the oily texture on their salad , is virgin coconut oil a better alternative to olive oil ? this is starting to sound more like a recipe channel . any input would be greatly appreciated dr. greger ( specifically on the sprouted nut ) . jason : i know you addressed dr. greger , but i have some thoughts that you might find helpful.re : sprouted nuts : i got into the idea of sprouting when dr. greger did his series on broccoli and sprouting . i bought a couple of books on the topic to learn more . it ’ s been a while since i read those books , but if memory serves , i believe that they did say that sprouted nuts do indeed have more nutrition – including more absorb-able nutrition . ( “ you are what you absorb . ” ) re : coconut oil vs olive oil : dr. greger covered coconut oil in this video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-coconut-oil-good-for-you / hope that was helpful.fantastic – thank you for the affirmation ( my research on sprouting nuts has been minimal ) and i am love ’ n the sprouted broccoli ( thanks for the heads up at your toronto visit dr. greger ) and other delisous seeds and beans i have sprouted . sprout on my friend , sprout on ! dear doctor gregor , your videos are phenomenal ! ! ! i share wherever and whenever i can on facebook , pinetrest , google + and twitter . i live with autoimmune poly endocrine syndrome . i cannot even list whether it ’ s i , ii , iii or iv because i bear the signs and symptoms in all four areas . i should not be alive based on all of the emergency room visits , hospital stays and allergies and through much prayer , intense research and videos like yours … … … . i am alive and doing well . one of the most recent things i learned from you that has really , really helped me sort out so much of the madness in my life is your emphasis on consuming whole foods . processed foods on a whole is poison to me but even organic and packaged foods were a recent growing issue and i really became disillusioned until i learned that i can still enjoy food but i must procure it in its organic , whole state first then transform it . so as far as cooking with oil goes , i purchase organic coconuts and process them at home to secure the oil and i can cook with this . this goes for everything else . i had to make a lot of changes and i ’ m learning as i go . it becomes clearer and clearer to me that man thrives when he eats as close to the soil as possible . thank you for your time and videos ! ! ! ! they are greatly appreciated ! ! had suspected this . i ’ m still curious about ghee ( if one could find it without environmental toxins ) . and clarified butter made from milks more compatible with humans are better . various ancient medicines ( including greek and roman ) mention many milks with different properties and tend to suggest best is of course human.a new study on ghee seems to be making the rounds on some newspapers . “ a spoon of ghee full of health : ‘ poses no danger to cardiac health ' ” . i think it ’ s this one.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23041740if anyone could share it , that ’ d be great.huh — they didn ’ t think to compare to a diet enriched with nonfatty plants . they had four groups , but apparently couldn ’ t add a fifth . partial funding from the international nut and dried fruit council … i ’ m allergic to nuts . all nuts . has there been a comparison between the health benefits in seeds as compared to nuts ? i ’ m looking for a way to enhance my salads without using nuts of course . i do use pumpkin seeds and sunflower and am wondering if there is enough fat in the seed to help with getting all the good from the nutrients in my salads.given the recent research showing that ldl-c ( cholesterol ) is not nearly as significant as ldl-p ( particle size & / or concentration ) , couldn ’ t one read these results differently ? that is , don ’ t these results show extra virgin olive oil causing a bigger drop in oxidized ldl than almonds while walnuts caused an increase in same ? almonds did cause the biggest decrease in homocysteine , but virgin olive oil was nearly as good and better than walnuts in that regard . couldn ’ t one make a case that since the fat-soluble antioxidant vitamins reside in the oil of a fruit , that refined oils can be more beneficial than whole fruits in some instances ? olives are the perfect example since as dr. greger stated , eating a bunch of olives perhaps gives the eater too much salt.just realized that since virgin olive oil caused an increase in apolipoprotein b while walnuts & almonds caused a decrease , the whole food does have a more beneficial effect on ldl-p than the refined oil in this case , correct ? hey dr gregor , i am a fan of yours – lots of great info you ’ ve posted in many videos and i thank you for that.is it my imagination or are you starting to recently omit too much important info ? like your post the other day about canned beans and the fact that you never mentioned the real health risk of bpa leaching out of the liners in canned food.now in this post about olive oil vs walnuts or almonds to reduce the “ bad ” ldl cholesterol . first of all who eats dry salad with just nuts on it ? i ’ d choke . i use 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil and nuts ( and much more ) in my salads , calorie wise the difference is trivial between olive oil versus nuts so i don ’ t understand why you would even mention that . 1 tbsp of olive oil is about 120 calories while the equivalent weight ( 14g ) of almonds is 80 calories and for walnuts about 95 calories.most importantly the idea that ldl cholesterol is “ bad ” is based on very old , outdated , science . as vegan minstrel pointed out 5 months ago in her post there is a big difference between the essential harmless “ big fluffy ” particles of ldl versus the high density small particle ldl which is the real “ bad ” type of ldl – yet you made no mention of this in this video.it ’ s a very important point.bottom line is yes you are correct that whole foods are nearly always healthier than refined / separated portions of whole foods but a better focus for this video might have been “ how to optimize the nutritional value and flavor of your salads ” because that reflects the reality of how we eat.thanks.have you tried ever making your own salad dressings with nuts / seeds + flavored vinegar in a blender à la dr. fuhrman ? he ’ s got recipes in his books and on his site . that way you ’ d get the full benefit of whole plant fats plus more palatable salads.the whole food , plant-based message in this video is a very important one . still it is important to note that reducing fat to 10 % of calories has had amazing effects on reversing heart disease , as illustrated in the esselstyn and ornish studies . to do this , one also has to be cognizant , and even limit whole food fats such as olives , avocados and nuts . they can be eaten , but only in moderation if one has cardiovascular concerns.you share similarities with dr. caldwell esselstyn but the one area which is a major diversion from his work is the use of oils , in particular olive oil . are you an advocate of olive oil or do you believe that dr. esselstyn is correct that all oils damage the endothelium and thus lead to greater numbers of cases of heart disease ? hi steve , i really appreciate you reposting your comment . did you happen to see this video ? i think the general theme in the research point to “ whole foods ” as the best source of nutrition . that said , olives , avocado , and flaxseed appear to be much more healthful than their oils . perhaps it ’ s the added benefit of fiber and antioxidants obtained in the whole foods ? olive oil is not a “ health food ” . i have heard the concept of olive oil ( or other types ) negatively affecting endothelial function , however , i am unfamiliar with the extent of research concluding this point . i feel like reversing heart disease will have different dietary requirements than simply living a healthful lifestyle.thank you joseph . you bring up an interesting point about whole foods . as you know , whole foods have shown rather consistently that they are better than the extracted vitamins and other nutrients . however i think there is an exception to this and that is in the case of juice . studies have shown some amazing evidence that certain juices have extremely positive and statistically significant benefits . for example , beetroot juice with high blood pressure , tart cherry juice with sleep and inflammation and recently blueberry juice with cognition in older adults . although the whole food is preferred in most cases , most of the time people won ’ t consume enough of the whole food to derive a clinically meaningful benefit . how do you feel about juice ? great question . we have so much research on juice ! see what you find . i think in general the whole fruit is best because the polyphenols need fiber to be absorbed correctly . nature knows best : ) however it needs to be put into perspective . a fresh glass of squeezed orange juice every now and again when you already eat a high-fiber diet is probably no big deal.does anyone have any good information on grapeseed oil and whether is is better than other oils for the occasional cooking or salad dressing application ? thank you very much in advance ! i read that it is high in vitamin b6 and that is not a good thing. almonds , calories , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cholesterol , fat , fruit , fruit juice , heart disease , heart health , ldl cholesterol , nuts , oils , olive oil , olives , phytosterols , seeds , walnuts the short-term effect of replacing refined olive oil with extra virgin olive oil , walnuts , or almonds on cardiovascular risk factors . adding nuts and seeds to one 's salad boosts the bioavailability of the fat-soluble carotenoid phytonutrients in the greens . see my video forgo fat-free dressings ? . oil would work , but whole food sources of fat ( and other nutrients ! ) are superior . for more on nuts and cholesterol see nuts and bolts of cholesterol lowering and for more on the adverse effects of too much sodium , see dietary guidelines : with a grain of big salt and salt ok if blood pressure is ok ?

PLAIN-2899	tipping firmicutes to bacteroidetes other than fiber , what else do plants make that animals don ’ t that could help account for how dramatically slimmer those who eat a plant based diets tend to be ? phytonutrients ! mammals including humans harbor two main types of friendly gut bacteria : bacteroidetes and firmicutes . in terms of obesity though one appears friendlier than other , there is mounting evidence that the gut flora is different in healthy patients than it is in obese patients , which primarily involves higher numbers of firmicutes than bacteroidetes in the case of obesity and overweight . just to keep them straight so you can remember , fatter is firmicutes and boney is bacteroidetes.obese individuals seem to have more firmicutes than bacteriodetes in their guts . if you put people on a diet for a year , you can actually change the proportion . give people certain antibiotics , may actually trigger obesity because we are mucking around down there . how can we improve our ratio ? there is a class of phytonutrients called polyphenols that do two things : they preferentially feed bacteriodetes while simultaneously suppressing the growth of firmicutes.so researches said , hey maybe that ’ s why the use of vinegar has been recommended for thousands of years for weight loss ! and it ’ s often made out of wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar , both of which have grapes and apples packed with polyphenols . the weight lowering properties of fruits , green tea and wine vinegar in obese people may be partly related to the polyphenol content of them which consequently changes the gut flora , which may consequently alter the balance between the two groups of bacteroidetes and the firmicutes bacteria in the favor of bacteroidetes.it ’ s funny … opponents to the power of phytonutrients often point to studies showing that up to 85 % of those wonderful blue anthocyanins in blueberries end up in your colon unabsorbed . but that may be exactly where the magic happens . this is the third of a three-part video series on keeping our gut bacteria happy . the first two discussed propionate and butyrate , two health-promoting short chain fatty acids produced by the fermentation of fiber that may be helpful in preventing obesity , cancer , and inflammation in general . this is a follow-up to similar studies comparing gut flora between populations eating different diets i talked about ages ago in gut flora obesity . more on phenolic phytonutrients in best fruit juice . vinegar may also help with weight loss via another mechanism detailed in my video is vinegar good for you ?

how can i get a hold of bacteroidetes ? i looked up bacteroidetes and found organic spirulina contains them . it must be from a pure safe source and organic spirulina is a cyanobacterium , a bacteroidete.what about the study by chen et al that says this ?

PLAIN-290	coffee caveats last month in the american journal of clinical nutrition , an editorial entitled “ coffee consumption and risk of chronic diseases : changing our views ” reviewed the growing evidence that for most people , the benefits of drinking coffee likely outweigh the risks . for example , a recent analysis of the best studies published to date suggests coffee consumption may lead to a modest reduction in overall cancer incidence , as detailed in my 1-min. video coffee and cancer . each daily cup o ’ joe was associated with about a 3 % reduced risk of cancers , especially bladder , breast , mouth , colorectal , endometrial , esophageal , liver , leukemic , pancreatic , and prostate cancers . what about the caffeine , though ? glad you asked ! check out what about the caffeine ? there are a few caveats . some health conditions may be worsened by coffee , such as insomnia , anxiety , gastroesophageal reflux ( heartburn ) , high blood pressure , and certain heartbeat rhythm irregularities . there are also compounds in coffee that increase cholesterol levels , but are effectively removed when filtered through paper , so drip coffee is preferable to boiled , french press and espresso . pregnant women should restrict caffeine consumption to less than two cups of coffee a day . despite the growing evidence of health benefits associated with coffee consumption , i still don ’ t recommend people drink it — not because it ’ s not healthy , but because there are even healthier choices . in this way , coffee is like a banana , another common convenient plant product . if you have a choice , i ’ d encourage you to make healthier fruit choices ( apples are better , berries are best ) . similarly , when it comes to beverages , i ’ d encourage you to choose an even healthier one , like green tea. is there any current information linking caffeine to migraines ? off to eat my morning banana … errr … apple ! ! headaches ( ha ) are common . it is important to correctly diagnose the type of headache you have . in my experience many patients who say they have migraines may be suffering from musculo-skeletal ha ’ s ( most common ms ha ’ s originate in upper neck and are felt along the back of the head or from temporal mandibular jt and felt on the side of the head ) . caffeine withdrawal ha ’ s are another type of ha . assuming the correct diagnosis of migraines … they are often associated with food triggers . in my experience avoiding foods that are high in tyramines ( a naturally occurring compound which is also a breakdown product of the amino acid tyramine ) is particularly helpful . it is particularly high in processed foods and increases in leftovers . the challenge is that it occurs in both animal products such as cheeses , processed and most meats and plant products such as nuts and snow peas . the best approach is to go on a plant based diet and when you get a migraine to list everything that you ate or drank within previous 24 hours . it does get tricky because it is the amount consumed that seems to be critical not stress . when under stress people tend to eat out , skip meals ( thereby eating more when they eat ) or eat leftovers . my patients always preferred avoiding migraines as opposed to treating them although they would occasionally “ push the envelope a little for foods like chocolate ” . caffeine which is actually added to some old migraine treatments like “ cafergot ” seems to be able to trigger migraines but it can depend on the amount , type and brewing characteristics . good luck.lowrie , if you ’ re addicted to caffeine , for sure you ’ re going to get a migraine if you don ’ t have your coffee and you won ’ t be able to function until you get your fix . it ’ s not a nice situation and so , i wouldn ’ t start drinking coffee if you don ’ t now . i don ’ t see anything wrong with a banana . it ’ s a good source of vitamin b6 which neither apples nor berries have , manganese which apples don ’ t have and has equivalent amounts of dietary fiber and vitamin c to an apple or berries . what about cholesterol in instant coffee ? coffee as with all plants don ’ t contain cholesterol . i don ’ t drink instant coffee but unless they add some animal product to it it should contain no cholesterol.it seems to me that any food or beverage that is habit forming and causes withdrawal symptoms when removed from the diet should never be considered as health promoting.abstention from such products seems like a “ no brainer ’ to me.hello mr. greger , are you going to post any video on the possible reason for the higher incidence of colorectal cancer among vegetarians in the epic-oxford study ? thank you ! — carlogreen tea should be avoided when receiving treatment with velcade for mm cancer – it is proven to reduce the positive results . pingback : quick collard wraps & blogging schedule ( ) i ’ ve reviewed ray kurzweil ’ s fantastic-voyage.net health guide . kurzweil is a very smart guy and very science literate , so in my mind there is , at least , a presumption of credibility . he recommends an alkaline diet , and specifically recommends drinking alkalyzed water and avoiding coffee because of its high acidity . are you aware of any peer-reviewed studies supporting or opposing this recommendation ? thanks very much , and thank you for your extremely credible and purely science-based recommendations . dr. greger covers alkalized water here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / alkaline-water-a-scam / as for alkalinity , almost all plant foods will produce a potential renal acid load ( pral ) that is negative ( alkaline ) because of the amino acid makeup . grains are very slightly acidic but most animal products are several times times more acidic . the pral can be calculated with this formula pral = 0.49 ( protein ) + 0.037 ( phosphorus ) – 0.021 ( potassium ) – 0.026 ( magnesium ) – 0.013 ( calcium ) . http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /

would live longer while consuming coffee despite it being bad for you : those who consume the most coffee tend to have higher incomes . these population studies are biased because comparatively wealthier professionals drink more coffee . for example , lower tier jobs often don ’ t have break rooms or areas with a coffee maker available and you cannot just make a cup and drink it anyway even if you have an on-site coffee maker . it is well known that having more wealth and higher job autonomy leads to better health outcomes because such people have more control over their lives , they have more optimism , stronger self-belief and also much less stress , but the poor have everything against them in those regards . see susan rosenthal ’ s free e-book “ power and powerlessness ” :

strong psychoactive drug ; its direct pharmacological effects are more powerful than those of cannabis . dependence on it has a marked physiological component . in objective terms , coffee is a stronger drug than pot , with a greater potential for toxicity.coffee is a powerful stimulant drug , causing dependence ( even 1 cup / day ) and illness – bladder irritation , stomach upset , headaches , anxiety , restlessness , heart palpitations , insomnia , elevated serum cholesterol , hypertension , prostate problems , etc.coffee contains 39 alkaloids , decaf coffee 38 . and these are not inert , producing the same health problems as regular coffee.coffee ’ s true identity as a drug has been defined out of existence – socially and legally – but it is a powerful drug with serious

kick as regular coffeejeremy laurance health editor november 19 , 2002it may be a decaf but it still carries a kick . scientists studying coffee have found that a triple espresso has a marked effect , regardless of whether it contains caffeine.the beverage caused an increase in the activity of the nervous system in both occasional and regular coffee drinkers , and the blood pressure of occasional drinkers rose.roberto corti , a cardiologist at the university of zurich who led the study of 15 volunteers , said it was the first time such disparities had been reported . he said the results , published in circulation , the journal of the american heart association , suggest an unknown ingredient in coffee other than caffeine stimulates the heart . coffee contains hundreds of different substances . “ until now we have attributed the cardiovascular effects of coffee to caffeine , but we found non-coffee drinkers given decaffeinated coffee also display these effects , ” he said . “ this demonstrates how little we know about the effects of one of our most popular beverages . ” one implication of the findings is that the potentially adverse effects of coffee on the heart could be less hazardous in regular drinkers with normal blood pressure . whether people with high blood pressure should avoid decaffeinated coffee remains unclear.the link does not appear to work . can you find the actual studies and post here ? i ’ ll be sure to investigate . thanks , bortogalthough coffee is brewed and filtered , there is still this probelm : http : / / www.foodproductiondaily.com / quality-safety / crisps-and-coffee-highest-acrylamide-levels-warns-uncrisps and coffee highest acrylamide levels , warns u.n.07 / 03 / 2005- a global risk analysis of nearly 7000 food items finds french fries , potato crisps and coffee recording the highest contamination levels of the carcinogen acrylamide , warns un committee , writes lindsey partos.scientists from 15 countries meeting under the aegis of jecfa , the un ’ s committee on food additives , caution that the harmful contaminant acrylamide in certain foods may be of public heath concern since it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.in april 2002 , acrylamide came to the attention of the food industry when scientists at the swedish food administration first reported unexpectedly high levels in fried , baked , grilled , toasted or microwaved carbohydrate-rich foods , for example chips , roast potatoes , crisps and bread.since then , an international effort of more than 200 research projects has been initiated around the world with their findings co-ordinated by national governments , the european union and the united nations.in the absence of any health-based guidance values ( tolerable intake levels ) for acrylamide , and a bid to construe a way forward to slicing this potential carcinogen out of the food chain , scientists meeting in rome last month assessed national dietary intake data for 17 countries . “ the major contributing foods to total exposure for most countries were potato chips ( 16-30 per cent ) , potato crisps ( 6-46 per cent ) , coffee ( 13-39 per cent ) , pastry and sweet biscuits ( 10-20 per cent ) and bread and rolls / toasts ( 10-30 per cent ) . others foods items contributed less than 10 per cent of the total exposure , ” the committee reports.tackling this figure , the un group urged national food safety authorities to work towards improving food preparation technologies that “ lower significantly the acrylamide content in critical foods . ” acrylamide appears to form when dietary items , typically plant commodities high in carbohydrates and low in protein , are subjected to high temperatures during cooking or other thermal processing.scientists now know that the most important precursor is the free amino acid asparagine which reacts with reducing sugars in the maillard reactions that also form colour and flavour.since 2002 research has shown that although trace amounts of acrylamide can be formed by boiling , significant formation generally requires a processing temperature of 120 c degrees or higher.most acrylamide is accumulated during the final stages of baking , grilling or frying processes as the moisture content of the food falls and the surface temperature rises , with the exception of coffee where levels fall considerably at later stages of the roasting process.acrylamide seems to be stable in the large majority of the affected foods , again with the exception of ground coffee for which levels can decline during storage over months . since formation is dependent on the exact conditions of time and temperature used to cook or heat-process a food , there can be large variations between brands of the same product and between batches of the same brand . large variations are also to be expected during cooking although this aspect has been less well documented.the composition of the food also has an influence , crucially the content of free asparagine and reducing sugars . varietal , storage and seasonal variations can occur . within ranges of natural variation , the limiting precursor in cereals is asparagine while fructose and glucose are more important in potatoes . other important factors are ph and water content.in a review submitted to the un group by europe ’ s € 600 billion food and drink industry ( ciaa ) apparently recent investigations have achieved a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in acrylamide levels of potato crisps by introducing several adjustments in the existing production procedures.but the un committee states : “ the detailed data behind this calculation were not reported and it is not known to what extent it has been applied by crisp producers . ” significant reduction was also reported from process-optimisation for non-fermented crispbread , while little progress was obtained so far in reducing levels in various other important intake sources , for example , roasted coffee and breakfast cereals.according to findings from the additive group the most efficient reduction has been achieved by using the enzyme asparaginase to selectively remove asparagine prior to heating . “ although tested both in cereal and potato models , the use is probably limited to specific food products manufactured from liquidised or slurried materials , ” says the group.several other means of lowering the precursor levels can be applied at various stages of the food chain , for instance , by variety selection and plant breeding , controlling growth and storage factors affecting sugar concentrations in potatoes , pre-treatment of potato pieces by soaking or blanching , and prolonged yeast fermentation time in breadmaking.other mitigation possibilities include alteration of the product composition : addition of competing amino acids or acidic compounds , and alteration of process conditions – lowering the frying temperature.but a key obstacle to this progress is the fact that the feasibility of adapting these methods to large-scale food processing has not been ‘ completely studied ’ in most cases.furthermore , any major changes would need to be checked for consumer acceptability , nutritional quality , and the possible increased formation of other undesirable substances.in its final recommendations , the committee urged : continued efforts to cut acrylamide concentrations in food ; and continued work on using pbpk modelling to better link human biomarker data with exposure assessments and toxicological effects in experimental animals.in addition , the committee highlighted the need for more occurrence data on acrylamide in foods consumed developing countries.thanks for the information ! feel free to share any studies on coffee and acrylamide here .

PLAIN-2909	optimal phytosterol source though nuts and seeds are packed with phytosterols , they are typically prescribed in butter form . i kid you not . or in margarine — even worse . for those wanting to lower their heart disease risk , eating trans fats is the last thing you need . eating margarine to get phytosterols is like eating fish to get omega 3s . remember , food is a package deal . by choosing plant-based sources we can get the nutrients we want , without trans fats or mercury . eating nuts and seeds offers the good without the bad.and studies show that smaller more frequent doses may be more effective than one big dose in a spread or pill . which makes total sense , right ? given the trash-picker analogy ? we want to have phytosterols constantly flowing through out gut throughout the day so they ‘ ll continue to keep stuffing the bins of our intestinal lining cells , allow excess cholesterol to pass.another reason that pills may not work as well is that we need fat to optimally absorb phytosterols , so that ’ s why they package it in margarine spreads , but nature put phytosterols right where you need it--in nuts and seeds , which have more than enough fat . but now there ’ s like phytosterol-fortified orange juice , and lemonaid , and like with the pills , we would not expect phytosterols to be as effectively absorbed . this closes out a five-part video series on the cholesterol-lowering effects of nuts and seeds . see how fiber lowers cholesterol for an explanation of the “ trash-picker analogy , ” then how phytosterols lower cholesterol and yesterday ’ s video-of-the-day optimal phytosterol dose . i elaborate on the “ package deal ” concept in risk associated with iron supplements , safest source of b12 , plant protein preferable , and food is a package deal . a few videos ( there are more than 50 ) on why fish are not the best choices for omega 3 ’ s include nerves of mercury , the effect of canned tuna on future wages , and dioxins in the food supply . don ’ t nuts make you fat , though ?

how about a side of halva for dessert ? oh wait ! you don ’ t need to eat foods with cholesterol in them in the first place ! paulc , you are correct , as with all the comparisons for nuts and seeds in dr g ’ s vid , they are all based on 100 grams and all would contribute a whopping amount of fat to the diet.also one thing that has been mentioned before but not in this vid because of time constraints is inflammation . all of the nuts and seeds are inflammatory with exception to flax seed and the ‘ not mentioned chia seeds ’ ; - ( so if i was going to try and lower my cholesterol and inflammatory load i would only recommend flax and chia seeds . but i would never recommend the 100 grams per day which is like 2 / 3 of a cup and 500 calories and 0ver 300 of those caloris from fat.i say , just don ’ t eat animals , eat plants and supplement with nuts and seeds one to two ounces a day.hemodynamic , m.d. , the claim you make about all other nuts being inflammatory seems to be counter to the empirical information about nuts ( especially walnuts ) that dr. greger has discussed and posted : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / black-versus-english-walnuts / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / fighting-inflammation-in-a-nut-shell / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / eating-healthy-on-the-cheap / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-do-nuts-prevent-sudden-cardiac-death / i get that nuts are high and in fat and need to be eaten in moderation , but is there something that i missed ? wholefoodchomper i am glad you linked those videos because i received this in e-mail and began to search for evidence . of course i should have gone to browse topics like you did ! the last thing i need is inflammation ! wfc , it is well know in biochemistry that higher ratios of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids lend the body to making more arachidonic acid ( aa ) . this is because the same enzymes that convert omega 3 fa to linolenic acid are used to convert omega 6 fa to linoleic acid ( la ) and arachidonic acid ( aa ) . here is a nice summary from nice website : http : / / www.azchia.com / ala _ conversion _ epa _ dpa _ dha.htm “ the issue is that the same enzymes that convert ala , also convert la into its long chain metabolite known as arachidonic acid ( aa 20 : 4ω-6 ) . given this scenario it is understandable that diets high in omega6 fatty acids can influence , and in reality reduce , the conversion of short chain omega3 fatty acid into its long chain metabolites . the second factor is genetic variations in gene encoding for delta-5 desaturase and delta-6 desaturase enzymes . these variations have been reflected in changes in desaturase expression or activity , and have been found to influence long chain fatty acid levels in the blood . ( glaser , et al . , 2010 ) . a third influence which affects conversion can be classified as dietary / lifestyle factors . this is in addition to the omega3 / omega6 dietary ratio discussed above . it has been shown that high intakes of saturated fats , trans-fat , alcohol and caffeine can have a detrimental affect on the role of delta-6 desaturase . ( horrobin , 1993 ) the result is impaired synthesis of long chain fatty acids . ” i ’ m not saying that nuts are bad for you i am saying that the higher the omega 6 to omega 3 ratio the more aa you will make , and the more aa you have in your body the more inflammation you will tend to have. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / chicken-eggs-and-inflammation / however , remember that food is a package and there are many things in foods ( nuts and seeds ) that may influence inflammation besides just the omega fa ’ s.take a look at the website nutrition data self below . they show the inflammation factor related to foods and in the very first post of this video , from myself , i included the link for flax . but here are the pages for flax and walnuts : flax http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / nut-and-seed-products / 3163 / 2 walnuts : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / nut-and-seed-products / 3138 / 2if you look in the middle of the page you will see the inflammation factor listed.i hope this helped . ; - ) thanks for sharing your explanation , but honestly i think it left me more confused . you make some interesting points , but i ’ m not sure that they convince me that “ all … nuts and seeds [ except for flax and chia seeds ] are inflammatory ” . i ’ m not a biochemist by any means , but as a lay person trying her darn best to be critical reader of scientific information , the azchia article you sited does not seem like a very credible source given its chia seed bias and the fact that most of the references in the bibliography are quite dated . additionally , based on the nutrition data self link you shared ( cool web-site by the way ) some nuts , like walnuts , do seem “ moderately inflammatory ” . however , i looked up some additional nuts and it does not seem that your claim is supported : almonds are listed as moderately anti-inflammatory , hazelnuts and macadamias are listed as strongly anti-inflammatory , and pecans as moderately anti-inflammatory . based on the current empirical evidence about nuts ’ anti-inflammatory abilities and the fact that food is indeed a packaged deal , i guess i ’ m still confused about your assertion that “ all … nuts and seeds [ except for flax and chia seeds ] are inflammatory ” .i will repeat what i stated previously with bolded words for emphasis , “ i ’ m not saying that nuts are bad for you i am saying that the higher the omega 6 to omega 3 ratio the more aa you will make , and the more aa you have in your body the more inflammation you will tend to have . ( i did not say you will have ) http : / / nutritionfacts.org / vide … however , remember that food is a package and there are many things in foods ( nuts and seeds ) that may influence inflammation besides just the omega fa ’ s . hence your finding that some nuts and seed may be anti-inflammatory overall.but i stand by my previous statement that foods with a higher omega 6 to omega 3 ratio will tend to make more arachidonic acid . some sources put almonds at a 1800 : 1 ratio . add some alcohol and caffeine and you will set yourself up for some added arachidonic acid formation . which means added inflammation.omega 3 fa are not converted to pro-inflammatory molecules . so the nuts with the lowest omega 6 to omega 3 ratio ( < 1 ) will have the highest anti-inflammatory properties . i don ’ t think it is as straightforward as that hemodynamic , although i agree that that is the theory ( that omega 6 fatty acids are pro-inflammatory and omega-3 ’ s are anti-inflammatory ) . for one thing , the clinical studies using nuts find them to be anti-inflammatory – not just walnuts , which have plenty of omega-3 ’ s but also almonds and others which as you note have a very high omega-6 : 3 ratio . that might be due to other things in those nuts that offset the effect of the n-6 fatty acids , but it also might be because the idea that n-6 and n-6 are strictly pro and anti inflammatory , respectively , is not quite right – or so the recent science would seem to suggest.have a look at fritsche , k.l. too much linoleic acid promotes inflammation – doesn ’ t it ? protaglandins , leukotrienes and essential fatty acids , 2008 ; 79 : 173-175.in reply : http : / / my.americanheart.org / idc / groups / ahaecc-internal / @ wcm / @ sop / documents / downloadable / ucm _ 424413.pdf please read the whole publication.thank you hemodynamic , m.d. for taking the time to clarify and explain this topic some more . i really appreciate it.i don ’ t know that i helped but i tried . i am learning all the time as well . that is one absolute with me is always trying to learn more . problem is i sometimes forget what i learned in the first place . only so much room left in that one brain cell of mine . ; - } i can totally relate to that . : ) my own research on this topic suggests that to minimize inflammation we should try to get as close as possible to equalizing our overall omega-6 to omega-3 ratio ( i.e. 1 : 1 ratio ) . most people are consuming concentrated high omega-6 oils that throw them into a 10 : 1 ratio or higher . so the goal is to bring it down to at least the range of 2 : 1 to 4 : 1.most nuts are predominately monounsaturated and therefore contribute little to raising our omega-6 levels . for example , although it is true that almonds have an extremely high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio , consider that an ounce ( 28g ) of almonds only contributes 3.4 grams of omega-6 fatty acids ( i.e only 12 % of the total mass of almonds is omega-6 ) . you can easily balance off such low omega-6 contributions by consuming moderate quantities of flax or chia seeds , which have an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of around 1 : 3 , which is very useful . the only common nuts that i know of that contribute a substantial mass of omega-6 fatty acids are walnuts , pinenuts and butternuts , although walnuts have a substantial quantity of omega-3 fatty acids so the overall ratio is not too bad ( i.e.3 : 1 ) .for those following a minimally processed whole foods plant based diet ( i.e do not use concentrated oils ) , the main source of omega-6 fatty acids are from seeds . for those striving to keep omega fatty acids in good balance , i think it is a good idea to moderate consumption of seeds , as well as butternuts and pine nuts . people who eat huge quantities of soya products could also tip the balance away from and optimal omega-6 to omega-3 ratio . notwithsanding these few rules , i think that one need not worry about normal nut consumption contributing to overall inflammation.feel free to challenge anything i have said . this is obviously a complex topic and i don ’ t know all the answers , but this is my understanding so far.below is a pathway of omega 6 fa and it shows you how it gets turned into aa . i ’ m trying to find an easy to understand webpage that will make it all a bit more clear , i hope . ; - } the above image is useless , here is a larger version . i wish i could edit or remove pics if i need to with this program.here is a recent published study july 2012 that is a systematic review that shows something interesting . increased omega 6 ( linoleic acid ) does cause increase in proinflammatory prostaglandin e2 and thromboxane b2 ( a metabolite of thromboxane a2 which is proinflammatory and the molecule that aspirin blocks formation of to reduce inflammation ) but it appears that in healthy people that it does not cause inflammation in the inflammatory markers that were evaluated . i would love to see if the people felt an increase in inflammation and aches and pains. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22889633 i can ’ t figure out how to reply without the box getting too narrow , which is why i didn ’ t reply to your post above . anyway , thanks for your replies . but i was puzzled because the first link you posted where you said “ read the whole thing ” seemed to support my suggestion that maybe omega-6 fatty acids ( i mean the parent la , not aa ) aren ’ t as bad as we have thought . i have always though it important to keep the la / ala ratio low , but the more recent science , coupled with the apparent anti-inflammatory effects of nuts , is making me keep my mind open on this issue at present . i just read the systematic review you posted the link for – interesting . so maybe la is neutral as far as inflammation goes , and then nuts have other components in them that on balance mean they have an anti-inflammatory effect.hilarious ! btw , great series of vids on nuts and seeds ! ; - } i love chia seeds . i order them bulk on amazon and the kids love them too . they add them to coconut water or hibiscus tea and they expand over night and become little suspended surprises that are fun to chew ! i just tried these magical seeds in a chia seed “ pudding ” inspired by a suggestion on the package . yum ! they are fun . who is the source of your chia seeds on amazon . these seeds are yummy , but kinda pricey ( compared to flax seeds ) where i get them.company is seeking health and they are called optimal chia seeds . 6 pound bag.super , thanks ! agree ! margarine with plantsterols ? whats next ? beef with aspirin or clopidigrel ? : - ) another reason to eat seeds and nuts in proper amounts . i noticed a number of comments to the previous video about weight gain from eating nuts . but i ’ m moderately active , eat well and probably larger portions of good food than i need ( healthy vegan ) , including seeds and nuts ( wheat germ , flax seeds , sunflower seeds , sesame seeds , walnuts , pistachio nuts ) at virtually every meal , and i stay slender . the great and unexpected side benefit of eating seeds and nuts regularly is that it totally eliminated my craving for chocolate and sweets . i was a true addict there , and would also put on a few extra pounds seasonally from eating too many sweets , but now — it ’ s not that i can take sweets or leave them , it ’ s that i don ’ t want them at all and feel great without them and do not gain weight . i have no explanation for this , but will continue to eat seeds and nuts . i am your new best friend ! i wholeheartedly agree with you . i too eat no sweets or anything processed ( except rice tortillas , i am gluten intolerant ) . i eat nuts and seeds throughout the day and do not put any weight on . i think some of these commenters are still eating junk but are ok with it as long as it is not an animal product . same experience here – if i crave something sweet , i eat some nuts ( or nutbutter ) and it disappears . you ’ re one of the lucky ones . i can ’ t control my weight when i eat very many nuts at all . i even have to watch the amount of peanut butter i eat . when i started eating nuts on a regular basis i saw a slow but steady increase of uncontrollable weigh gain , before i realized what was causing it- 10 lbs in just a little over a year . i didn ’ t think that nuts could be the cause because of what dr. greger had said about nuts in his videos , but apparently , that doesn ’ t apply to everyone . once another nutritional expert advised me to stop eating nuts , the weight came off . nuts just don ’ t work for everyonei love reading the comments here as much as i love watching the videos . thanks for all the valuable information everybody . it ’ s really helpful – even the criticism.was the fish comment really necessary ? … really ? i see no problem with it at all . fish ( like phytosterol supplemented margarine ) is not a health food , which is a point that dr. greger has made many many times ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = fish ) . having him underscore that here as a juxtaposition to a point that he has made many times before is simply a non-issue . in fact , i rather like it . because it may even encourage folks to research fish a bit more.oh , right , because dha & epa are akin to a tub of artificial trans fat.just like anything of animal origin is as good of a source of nutrients as a scoop of sewer sludge with some added vitamins / minerals , eh ? it ’ s just a little over the top , is all i ’ m saying.i understand that you may have some stylistic issues with dr. greger ’ s approach of delivering the message . that ’ s fine . however , it seems that you ’ re misunderstanding the point ( s ) that dr. greger is making about food being a packaged deal . he didn ’ t say that “ dha & epa are akin to a tub of artificial trans fat . ” ( in that particular analogy , you got the comparison wrong ; it ’ s the fish , not dha / epa , that is akin to trans fats . more on this below . ) he also didn ’ t say “ anything of animal origin is as good of a source of nutrients as a scoop of sewer sludge with some added vitamins / minerals ” . these statements are examples of your own misinterpretation of what dr. greger has said and the point that he is making about food being a packaged deal . regarding the fish comment in this video , dr. greger isn ’ t discounting the positive effects of dha / epa . he is making a comparative statement in the form of an analogy to underscore his point about how ingesting one food for its good nutrients ( e.g. fish or supplemented margarine ) can be detrimental if that particular food also contains known toxins and damaging substances ( e.g. , mercury , dioxins , xenoestrogens , and pcbs in the case of fish and trans fats in the case of supplemented margarine ) . in fact , dr. greger has good things to say about dha / epa and how to go about getting them w / o all the pollutants ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / omega-3-fatty-acids / ) . and , i know you know that he recommends a low dose yeast- or algae-derived dha / epa supplement ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-greger % e2 % 80 % 99s-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / ) b / c i ’ ve shared that with you in the past . dr. greger isn ’ t the first and only doctor to denounce seafood as a non-health food . fish is dangerous to consume and that is why pregnant women and children are told to avoid it . the rest of us should as well . regarding the “ sewer sludge ” comment , in another thread i ’ ve already pointed out to you that you misinterpreted what dr. greger said ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / new-mineral-absorption-enhancers-found / # comment-603192806 ) , but i ’ ll restate it here once again . what he said , while talking about the legal definition of “ excellent / good source ” is : “ … you can throw a multivitamin into a scoop of sewer sludge and call it a good source of half a dozen things . ” he said nothing about animal source foods being equivalent to sewer sludge . instead , he showed how the legal definition of “ excellent / good source ” can be manipulated . in fact , what he actually said about animal sourced foods ( in this case , milk and beef ) in that particular video was that they ’ re not a “ good source ” of nutrients b / c it isn ’ t possible to get certain nutrients w / o the harmful doses of hormones and saturated fats ( not to mention a bunch of other industrial toxins found in animal fat ) . your body converts omega 3 from plants ( ala ) to dha and epa . fish has already preformed dha so your body does not need to convert it . ala is not converted effectively to dha under the condition that one is consuming too many omega 6 fatty acids . since most whole plant foods contain good ratios of omega 6 : omega 3 , this is of no concern unless one is eating a lot of nuts other than walnuts , flax seed and chia seed.the national academy of sciences does not recognize epa and dha as essential . this means there is enough evidence for them to conclude that we can make enough of it without eating it in its preformed state.in addition … do vegetarians have to eat fish for optimal cardiovascular protection ? 1 – 3 am j clin nutr 2009 ; 89 ( suppl ) : 1s – 5s.interest in the cardiovascular protective effects of n – 3 ( omega-3 ) fatty acids has continued to evolve during the past 35 y since the original research describing the low cardiovascular event rate in greenland inuit was published by dyerberg et al . numerous in vitro experiments have shown that n – 3 fatty acids may confer this benefit by several mechanisms : they are antiinflammatory , antithrombotic , and antiarrhythmic . the n – 3 fatty acids that have received the most attention are those that are derived from a fish source ; namely the longer-chain n – 3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ; 20 : 5n – 3 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ; 22 : 6n – 3 ) . more limited data are available on the cardiovascular effects of n – 3 fatty acids derived from plants such as a-linolenic acid ( ala ; 18 : 3n – 3 ) . observational data suggest that diets rich in epa , dha , or ala do reduce cardiovascular events , including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death ; however , randomized controlled trial data are somewhat less clear . several recent meta-analyses have suggested that dietary supplementation with epa and dha does not provide additive cardiovascular protection beyond standard care , but the heterogeneity of included studies may reduce the validity of their conclusions . no data exist on the potential therapeutic benefit of epa , dha , or ala supplementation on those individuals who already consume a vegetarian diet . overall , there is insufficient evidence to recommend n – 3 fatty acid supplementation for the purposes of cardiovascular protection ; however , ongoing studies such as the alpha omega trial may provide further information . my goodness gracious … the benefits of this stuff is much farther reaching than just cardiovascular . research the connections between it and mental health as well.http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / omega-3 _ fatty _ acid # conversion _ efficiency _ of _ ala _ to _ epa _ and _ dhathe short-chain n − 3 fatty acids are converted to long-chain forms ( epa , dha ) with an efficiency below 5 % in men , and at a greater percentage in women , which may be due to the importance for meeting the demands of the fetus and neonate for dha.conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to longer-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in human adults.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16188209efficiency of conversion of alpha-linolenic acid to long chain n-3 fatty acids in man.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11844977so , take walnuts , for example . let ’ s say for every 9g n-3 ( ala ) you get 4g n-6 . factor in that the ala here converts at < 5 % to longer n-3 's , and it 's lessened by the presence of n-6 , you 're looking at a pretty shoddy deal in terms of getting your tissue levels in order.now take wild alaskan salmon . for 2.5g epa / dha you get < 0.25g n-6 . that is a far , far better ratio.if you want to eat walnuts , fine . if salmon , fine . just realize what the reality of the situation is.is mercury , dioxins and other contaminants healthy for the fetus ? what about brain fog caused from fish consumption . you cannot justify fish in this way. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / fish-fog / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-effect-of-canned-tuna-on-future-wages / these are just several of many points against fish . food is a package deal , if you get preformed dha with a plethora of pollutants i dont see the justification.alexander are you an upset pescatarian ? what was wrong with the mercury comment from dr. greger ? not to mention saturated fat , dioxin , pcb and prozac … .. nuts and other plant fats are so tasty and satisfying , that it ’ s easy to eat too many . i blend 4-5 walnuts / almonds , 1-2 tbsp flax seeds , and a tsp chia seeds into our morning green drinks , but that is the limit . i couldn ’ t lose the last 10-15 pounds until i quit making cashew gravy and guacamole , and i quit snacking on nuts . i like keeping my bmi at 19-20 . if i did not limit nuts and other high fat plant foods , my bmi would be on the higher end of normal . any food we love can become addicting . for some of us it ’ s easier to eliminate tempting foods completely than to only eat tiny amounts . speaking of short-chain n-3 to long-chain n-3 conversion efficiency , what do you think of the following study : http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 92 / 5 / 1040.full.pdf + htmlnotice in table 5 how fish eaters and vegans have vastly different intakes of epa and dha yet the plasma blood levels are relatively close.there are natural sources of phytosterols , other than nuts and seeds . that chart in the last video was from a study that on its face said it was looking only at the stats for nuts and seeds.i haven ’ t discovered a definitive , exhaustive list . apparently , there are different types , some foods haven ’ t been tested , folks disagree ( imagine that ! ) , etc . but here ’ s one. http : / / lpi.oregonstate.edu / infocenter / phytochemicals / sterols / one ounce of almonds just edges out one-half cup of brussels sprouts . i can ’ t afford to eat five ounces of almonds . but five servings of b. sprouts … i probably do that once a week . ( love those little suckers . ) it is misleading to look at weight as opposed to per x calories or per serving . and lots of plants have phytosterols . it would be interesting to add up what any whole food vegan is getting , even without nuts and seeds . but you ’ d run into the problem that not everything has been tested , like i said . looks like folks who write studies on this subject sometimes end up running their own tests to get the relevant figures.we shouldn ’ t get bogged down and forget real life experience . which diet has been shown to reverse heart disease ? only one : low fat vegan ( i ’ m talking around 10 % fat here ) . any evidence that adding nuts to that diet helps in any respect ? i ’ d love to see that ( nuts are yummy ) , but i haven ’ t.my husband and i were whole food vegans for nine years , not going too high in fat but allowing ourselves a bit of olive oil and some nuts on occasion . oops , he silently develops a 95 % blockage of his left main artery and almost dies ( no symptoms til the end , cholesterol a shade over 150 , no smoking , plenty of exercise ) . now it ’ s low fat for us . three years later , he ’ s doing great , and we ’ re not inclined to mess with that . question about omega-3 fatty acids – i ’ m hearing a lot about how vegans often have a dangerously high omega-6 to omega-3 ratio and that for that reason , it ’ s good to bulk up on omega-3 fatty acids through sources like flaxseed , walnuts , etc . i ’ m happy to do that and in fact have incorporated both into my diet . but since i don ’ t really consume any foods high in omega-6 like cottonseed oil and other oils , or really much in the way of processed foods at all , is that omega-6 : omega-3 ratio really even an issue ? and in fact , i was even wondering whether it ’ s possible that i ’ m not getting enough of the “ bad ” omega-6 fatty acids and have too low an omega-6 : omega-3 ratio . and if so , what healthy , plant-based foods ( not vegetable oils , etc . ) should i consume to increase my omega-6 intake ? most of the doctors that discuss omega-3s seem to assume that we ’ re all getting too much omega-6 , but it seems like sticking to a whole-food , plant-based diet would ensure that that doesn ’ t happen . i honestly don ’ t get why vegans tend to have such high omega-6 : omega-3 ration . unless of course most vegans are junk-food vegans , which seems unlikely since i would think that most vegans are more health-conscious than the average american eater … thank you . how do the black and gray areas differ at the 6 second marks in the video , please ? fat vs. phytosterols ? pumkins seeds are very high in whatever is gray . thank you.are pumpkin seeds high or low ? the black vs grey lines are confusing. butter , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , cholesterol , fat , fish , heart disease , heart health , margarine , mercury , nutrient absorption , nuts , omega-3 fatty acids , orange juice , phytonutrients , phytosterols , plant-based diets , seeds , supplements , trans fats whole food sources of phytosterols , such as seeds and nuts , are likely superior to supplements or phytosterol-fortified spreads and beverages . this closes out a five-part video series on the cholesterol-lowering effects of nuts and seeds . see how fiber lowers cholesterol for an explanation of the " trash-picker analogy , " then how phytosterols lower cholesterol and yesterday 's video-of-the-day optimal phytosterol dose . i elaborate on the " package deal " concept in risk associated with iron supplements , safest source of b12 , plant protein preferable , and food is a package deal . a few videos ( there are more than 50 ) on why fish are not the best choices for omega 3 's include nerves of mercury , the effect of canned tuna on future wages , anddioxins in the food supply . don 't nuts make you fat , though ? that 's the topic of tomorrow 's video-of-the-day nuts and obesity : the weight of evidence . if you haven 't yet , you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here .
PLAIN-2919	the wrong way to boost serotonin the neurotransmitter serotonin , often referred to as the “ happiness hormone , ” is found in plant foods , but serotonin doesn ’ t cross the blood brain barrier , so it shouldn ’ t affect your mood no matter how much you eat.the precursor to serotonin , however , what your brain makes serotonin out of , is an amino acid called tryptophan , and there ’ s a transport protein in the brain that plucks tryptophan out of the bloodstream and so what you eat can end up affecting your mood . back in the 70 ’ s they did tryptophan depletion experiments where you give people specially concocted tryptophan deficient diets , and indeed their mood suffers , they get irritable , annoyed , angry , depressed.likewise you can give people tryptophan pills to improve their mood , and indeed it came a popular dietary supplement , until … people started dying from something called eosinophilia – myalgia syndrome , an incurable , debilitating and sometimes fatal flu-like neurological condition caused by the ingestion of tryptophan supplements . may have been due to some unknown impurity , but better safe than sorry . instead of supplements , there are dietary strategies one can use to improve mood . [ , which we 'll talk about next ] this is the second of a four-part series ( mentioned in uprooting the leading causes of death ) on natural ways to boost serotonin in the brain . yesterday ’ s video-of-the-day human neurotransmitters in plants noted that plants themselves can contain serotonin . tomorrow ’ s video-of-the-day a better way to boost serotonin will talk about getting dietary tryptophan into the brain , which we ’ ll then optimize in best way to boost serotonin . avoidance of soda and artificial colors may also improve behavior in children and adolescents . i ’ ve got dozens of videos on supplements – the good , the bad , the ugly and the just plain snake oil . unfortunately , too many people rely on the questionable advice from health food store employees ( see my four-part video series starting here ) . if you haven ’ t yet , you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here.elpool , dr g. must admire sly stallone , because this is an , “ avalance of ‘ psycho ’ thrills ” with his cliffhangers . ; - } i could totally hang like that off of a cliff ledge with one arm carrying 75 pounds of guns and ammo . i could . i just don ’ t want to is all.you and your cliff hangers ! : - ) i read that tyrosine and phenylalanine compete with tryptophan for absorption . apparently because of this , some healthcare practitioners believe that food sources of tryptophan do not cause a significant enough increase in blood levels of tryptophan to produce therapeutic results — so therefore it ought to be taken as a supplement to increase its blood levels.http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = nutrient & dbid = 103since 2002 when the ban on tryptophan was lifted there have been no cases of ems liked to it . it is unlikely that you could achieve therapeutic levels of trytophan through diet.love what you do and this particular video i find a bit disingenuous or something . it is quite well known that the toxicity / deaths from tryptophan were caused by manufacturer contamination . one of the few , large manufacturing companies , showa denko k.k. , tokyo , had contaminated their fermentation tanks . this was jumped on by the fda to crush the tryptophan supplement market just as the market for prozac ( approved just 2 years prior ) was really taking off . likely no connection but still , makes me wonder . it is not as if it was a big mystery why tryptophan use was associated w / ems . it was not the tryptophan , it was sloppy manufacturing and contamination . should we avoid lettuce because it has been sold contaminated.i totally agree that supplementing is 2nd choice at best with diet as 1st line treatment . but i certainly would not call tryptophan pills “ the wrong way ” nor would i imply that they are particularly dangerous.you may be right but it looks like there isn ’ t a consensus . see http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / tryptophan # tryptophan _ supplements _ and _ emsthis is not correct . there have been cases since the disaster just check the mayo clinic site or the cdc . let me tell you , it ’ s not worth it ! i would give anything to have my life back.yes , showa denko kk produced contaminated product but it was because they eliminated one of the charcoal filtering processes in order to produce more bulk product … make more money . there ’ s nothing in place to stop this kind of disaster from happening again , with any supplement.i totally agree — “ better safe than sorry . ” i would rather err on the side of caution * especially * with supplements , when in doubt . when in doubt – throw it out ! ; - } history tells us that isolating one single factor from food can be dangerous ( e-vitamin , betacarotene ) – i wote for the package ! i am really intersted in your information but hate the video format.would it be possible to include a written article with the information together with the video for those who prefer tro get information via print ? thanks.i agree . i have a hearing loss , and either need closed captioning or text . wish this was possible.jhellen and nancywb947 : volunteers have begun transcribing dr. greger ’ s videos ( in english and languages other than english ) . if you know anyone who could pitch in with the effort , please point them to these instructions : https : / / docs.google.com / document / edit ? id = 1vlqvcunrc47yrti861qch09yesamy5e-pjgzbqaybr4dr . greger already does this . read the transcript ! it ’ s right above the doctor ’ s note.i love these videos . keep them coming ! thank you ! this is a really old story regarding tryptophan … jonathan wright , md covered it in great detail about 20 years ago . if memory serves it was a genetically modified strain of japanese origin that caused the problem having nothing to do with the amino acid . that did not however stop the fda from pulling it off the market in typical gestapo technique . were they only so responsive for the myriad drugs they approve ! i have been into nutritional research for 51 years … and personally experiment with food and substances , before recommending or panning them . i have been using tryptophan for the last two years without a problem … it is a great sleep promoter , when taken at bedtime . i go to sleep happy and wake up happy on a daily basis … and i am in my late seventies.i have great admiration for dr. greger and have followed his work for sometime and appreciate the time and energy he has put into it . but yes , i agree with many of the responses . i personally have never had to take tryptophan , perhaps due to my very healthy , nearly vegan diet , but for those that have a chemical imbalance and benefit from it ’ s use , more power to them for being smart enough to try it . i ’ m a certified nutrition consultant and equally important , i worked at a vitamin store for over 10 years and never heard of a negative incident , only positive , while using tryptophan . so while i ’ m ranting , i ’ m a bit offended by dr. greger ’ s comments about people that work at health food stores . i learned and experienced so much through the feedback of clients and the training the facility i worked for offered . there maybe exceptions , as there are in many occupations , but i have met and worked with many very knowledgable staff at various health food stores that have the utmost level of integrity helping clients improve their health through supplementations.i worked for many years in health food stores ( including the “ big dog ” whole foods as well as small independent store ) . my experience goes both ways . i have encountered quite a few employees who are very knowledgeable and i have also heard truly appalling ignorance being expressed as fact . i think caveat emptor is always an excellent rule no matter what you are buying and no matter where . i think it is most important of all when dealing with your own health and how your body is treated and what is going into it . sadly , our educational system and media train people to be ignorant sheep rather than to take responsibility and learn what is needed.the health food store i ’ ve frequented for the past 25 years , has had problems with both past owners , and some employees not knowing the side affects of the “ supplements ” and herbal remedies they are peddling to customers.for example , when i was looking for the essential oil of calendula , another essential oil was thrust upon me from another part of the marigold , which while fragrant , was toxic if ingested.the owner downplayed my comments on the essential oil saying that it was pharmaceutical industry propaganda . this may be partially true . but , where there is smoke , there should be more investigation.i did not purchase what she was pushing , and that may have saved my dog ’ s life . i did bring in information that was on the web site , and was told we cannot believe everything on the web . true . but , we cannot believe everything a salesperson peddles to us either.this store owner-sales person died of liver damage , not from drinking , but from ingesting far too many supplements of comfrey , a natural plant which she declared “ safe ” – she and the industry who trained her.investigate before you buy whether it is food , drugs , or supplements ! ! ! and , it ’ s okay to walk away.curious. i ’ ve read it is turned into 5-htp in small intestine by high ratio of good bacteria , probiotics . that 5-htp is brain converted to melatonin to sleep and serotonin for alert wakefulness and feel good . sleepy daytime use . ? ? i agree about having a written article with the video . we ’ re far out in the country and the video will not play with our extremely slow internet connection.in europe 5-htp is used , could this one be also dangerous ? i took tryptophan supplements which i might say were huge , some twenty seven years ago for a sleep problem . during that period i experienced a severe gallbladder attack ( unusual considering i was only 31yrs old and ate healthy ) . as a subsequence i lost my gallbladder . the surgeon said it was so full of large gallstones that it had to be removed . shortly after i noticed that the tryptophan tablets were taken off the market ! i believe i lost my gallbladder because of tryptophan ! for some people to die because of them , ( it is believed ) , is terrible.it is well proven that the problems caused by tryptophan supplements were due to bacterial contamination in manufacture and had nothing at all to do with the tryptophan . so far as i know , there is also zero connection between tryptophan intake in any form and gallbladder health ( aside from it being one the essential ones to consume since we can ’ t synthesize it ) . it is unfortunate that you lost your gallbladder but the stones and surgery had no connection to your taking tryptophan supplements . belief is quite different from causality or proof.eagles438 , also curious as to what you meant by “ healthy diet ” ? i would guess that about 95 % of people , is asked would say they eat a healthy diet . if you get the actual detail of what they eat , more likely 5 % or less actually do so.i was one of the victim ’ s of l-tryptophan and it scares me to see this product back on the shelves . this is a horrible illness that ruins your life ! ! i love this site , and i have enjoyed many of these videos , but i must take exception with your assertion about “ l-tryptophan supplements ” causing those deaths , when the very article in your video stated – as have many of your informed readers below – that those deaths were all linked to one source ( showa denko ) , which produced the contaminated supplements that caused all of the l-tryptophan deaths . of course , geoffrey levens ( below ) pointed out the prozac link – and i don ’ t think that was an accident . big pharma spends tons of money on lobbying efforts – and the spreading of misleading information in this case caused widespread panic over the supplement , which led to a ban on l-tryptophan – meaning the consumer had fewer choices ( especially between supplements or drugs – if you can ’ t get the supplement , you have to buy the drug – not counting the few educated folks who manage to get decent info on nutrition for countering deficiencies ) . this gave prozac a big ( unfair , artificially-created ) market advantage . glad the ban has since been lifted . 26 people died from that contaminated supply , but more than 2500 deaths have been linked to prozac – almost 100x more than the contaminated l-tryptophan supplements ! don ’ t throw the baby out with the bath water ! eosinophilia – myalgia syndrome came about with the introduction into the marketplace of genetically engineered l-tryptophan , from a japanese company.because president herbert walker bush was about to allow gmo foods and drugs into the marketplace , his administration banned all sources of l-tryptophan to save lives , or so they said.i ’ ve had a bottle of l-tryptophan , for decades which i have used sparingly whenever i absolutely cannot get to sleep , and i have never had any adverse health problem related to its ingestion.now , we have myriad of foods and pharmaceuticals whose dna has been altered with antibiotic resistant bacteria , genes from other species , and possibly from other kingdoms , all because scientists can do this. http : / / www.nature.com / cr / journal / v22 / n1 / fig _ tab / cr2011158ft.html and the fda has a rubber stamped policy that these foods / drugs are not significantly different from any other foods , a policy likely written by michael taylor , then a lobbyist now a vp , for monsanto.i don ’ t trust anything that the u.s. fda puts out.anyone guess what the health outcomes will be besides death and endocrine disruption ? buy what you want over the internet if you ’ re sure it ’ s safe . if it ’ s allowed in most countries , but not your own , it may be safe.here in the uk we can buy some things that are banned in the usa but we can ’ t buy melatonin over the counter.i have articles that say triptophan from food like white meat is turned into 5-htp by the small intestine and that this is what the brain uses to make serotonin for awake or melatonin for sleep . it said to take 5-htp pill with white meat . it did not mention l-triptophan pills . i may have felt some improvement doing this last mth . but hard to be surei have article that says healthy gut bacteria needed to turn triptophan into 5-htp which the brain makes serotonin and melatonin from . it says take strong hq delayed release probiotic , 5-htp pill , triptophan rich white meat . didn ’ t mention triptophan pills . maybe due to past quality risk concerns . ? ? 1 mth tried so far withmaybe some drep depression help . would adding triptophan pills be worth trying . ? ? is it too late to comment on this video ? coincidentally , i was reading aboutthis very thing a few weeks ago and took the time to track it down and readabout … ok , wikipedia about it.here is what wikipedia says about tryptophan as a dietary supplement : > tryptophan supplements and ems [ edit ] > there was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome ( ems ) in the > u.s. in 1989 , which caused 1,500 cases of permanent disability and at least > thirty-seven deaths . after preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak > was linked to intake of tryptophan , the u.s. food and drug administration > ( fda ) banned most tryptophan from sale in the us in 1991 , and other > countries followed suit . [ 38 ] > subsequent epidemiological studies [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] however , were able to pinpoint > the syndrome to those exposed to specific batches of l-tryptophan supplied > by a single large japanese manufacturer , showa denko kk . [ 42 ] > it eventually became clear that the cause had not been the tryptophan itself , > but rather that flaws in showa denko ’ s 1980s manufacturing process > ( long since corrected ) had allowed trace impurities to contaminate these > batches , and those impurities were in turn responsible for the 1989 ems > outbreak . [ 38 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] so , i am wondering if this changes anything in your video about the safety or danger or taking l-tryptophan supplements.this video is in a whole different century that those deaths supposedly due to tryptophan were , and it was not mentioned about the defects in the manufacturing process.so , did wikipedia not get something right , or is taking tryptophan supplements not deadly ? that seems like a strong claim to make if there is not hard evidence to support it ? brux , fwiw i worked in supplement dept of whole foods while simultaneously being an acupuncturist at that time . the wiki article is correct , the problems were all from contamination due to mfg process and not the tryptophan . so far as i know it is quite safe as is 5-htp which is what tryptophan becomes in your body on its way to becoming seratonin and is also available as a supplement . 5-htp has a bit more chance to cause g.i. upset though as it ( but not tryp . ) can be converted to seratonin in the gut where it is biologically activethanks geoffrey , a lot of the videos here seem to rely on hyperbole and scare tactics just as much as any other food industry niche ? my understanding was that the japanese lab was using genetic engineering to make their tryptophan , but i would like to understand more about the problem , and if there is enough of a difference in the way other labs produce tryptophan to warrant any possible risk of any problem. adolescence , alternative medicine , brain health , complementary medicine , depression , eosinophilia – myalgia syndrome , fruit , greens , medications , mental health , mood , mushrooms , plant protein , plant-based diets , side effects , soy , supplements , tryptophan , vegetables tryptophan is the precursor to the " happiness hormone " serotonin , so why not take tryptophan supplements to improve mood and relieve symptoms of depression ? this is the second of a four-part series ( mentioned in uprooting the leading causes of death ) on natural ways to boost serotonin in the brain . yesterday 's video-of-the-day human neurotransmitters in plants noted that plants themselves can contain serotonin . tomorrow 's video-of-the-day a better way to boost serotonin will talk about getting dietary tryptophan into the brain , which we 'll then optimize in best way to boost serotonin . avoidance of soda andartificial colors may also improve behavior in children and adolescents . i 've gotdozens of videos on supplements--the good , the bad , the ugly and the just plainsnake oil . unfortunately , too many people rely on the questionable advice from health food store employees ( see my four-part video series starting here ) . if you haven 't yet , you can subscribe to my videos for free by clicking here .
PLAIN-2929	kiwifruit and dna repair in 2003 a landmark study was published in the journal carcinogenesis . now we 've known " plant – based diets rich in fruit and vegetables can preveent development of several chronic age-related diseases , including cancer , but why ? " ” consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with decreased risk of cancer , but why ? the “ mechanism behind this protective effect is not clear . we know “ these foods are rich in antioxidants , which are capable of decreasing oxidative damage to dna and thus might prevent mutation and cancer , ” but what about the second line of defense against oxidative dna damage , dna repair . we ’ re going to get some dna damage in our world no matter how healthy our diets , so its critical to find ways to upregulate our dna repair enzymes to better assist with stitching our dna back together . so , how about we give people some kiwifruits on and off for a few weeks and see what happens . why kiwifruits ? because it was funded by the “ ” international kiwifruit organization . you got to get funding from somewhere . first , what happened to the level of dna damage . each symbol represents the dna damage measured in one person . so day zero , no kiwifruit , the " wo " means without kiwifruitm and you can see they start out all over the map . maybe some were smokers , or sat in traffic , who knows . but then here they go on 1 kiwi a day , then they go back to zero , then 2 a day , then zero , then 3 a day . it wasn ’ t completely consistent on every day for every person , but you can kind of get a sense that the weeks without the kiwifruits dna damage tended to go up . and indeed that ’ s what the statistical analysis showed . significantly less dna damage on the days they were eating kiwifruits . note that it didn ’ t seem to matter how many kiwis they were eating , though . they seemed to get the same benefit whether they were eating 1 or 3 . kiwifruits have antioxidants , so no wonder there was less dna damage , but once you already have dna damage can kiwifruit help with the restoration ? so this was our first line of defense , the antioxidants in plant foods . now on to our second defense line of defense , dna repair . this is measuring dna repair rates . level of dna repair off kiwis , on kiwis , off kiwis , on kiwis , off kiwis , on kiwis , . now although it appears the 3 kiwis did better , than 1 or 2 statistically all 3 kiwi doses appeared pretty much the same , suggesting there ’ s some sort of plateau effect . maybe there ’ s just some phytonutrient in kiwis that boosts this dna repair enzyme system and it ’ s really just a matter of whether we have it in your bloodstream or not , rather than how much of it is there . what would be interesting is if you added a different fruit or vegetable on top of the kiwi , with a whole different portfolio of phytonutrients ; would they complement one another or would it just be a plateau across the board . we didn ’ t find out until recently … . ( we ’ ll look at this study in tomorrow ’ s video ) this is the second video of a three-part series about the latest discoveries on kiwi fruit . see also yesterday ’ s nutritionfacts.org video-of-the-day kiwifruit for irritable bowel syndrome . other ways to protect one ’ s dna include eating broccoli , avoiding bacon , not overdoing stevia , and eating a plant-based diet in general . see repairing dna damage and research into reversing aging . in tomorrow ’ s video plant-based diets and cellular stress defenses we ’ ll see if we can break through that kiwi ceiling ! in the meanwhile , there are lots ( and i mean lots ) of other videos to peruse.dr g is spending just another day at the office exploiting plants and their ability to heal . ; - } is this effect unique to kiwi fruit ? could the same thing happen with red delicious apples , or kale or any number of other plant-based food ?

( ^ _ ^ ) damnit ! whats with the cliffhanger ? were the kiwis organic or conventional ? and do you think it matters which ? any research on the effects of organic vs conventional ? also , what were their diets like aside from including 1 – 3 kiwis a day ? i remember one video on this site which shows measurements of chemical ’ s in kid ’ s urine before , during and after eating organic . that study doesn ’ t directly address whether the chemicals interfere with dna repair , but i thought you might be interested in learning about the video if you didn ’ t know of it already . there may even be more studies concerning organic vs not on this site . i just can ’ t keep it all in my head.note that i constantly have the same kinds of questions that you do . you have company in wanting to know the effects of conventional produce on our health.bet amla works better.that is so interesting that 1 is as good as 3 . i rarely eat kiwi , but i will think about adding them ( well , 1 ! ) . of course with studies like for example the antioxidant value of all vegetables against cancer , that you so nicely presented , we are spoiled ! we get to know all the veg in comparison ! so really while a kiwi might be good , is an orange more effective ? are berries more protective ? is 1 apple twice as repair-inducing . i am now used to being spoiled with answers so i need to know it all ! lol ! you are spoiling us ! ! thank you for all your hard work http : / / www.nsedreams.com / pwp / splash.jsp ? pwpid = asw9345983 & textcachelocale = en-au http : / / www.nsedreams.com / pwp / splash.jsp ? pwpid = asw9345983 & textcachelocale = en-audr . greger . generally speaking , is dna repair a good thing for someone who already has cancer ? the reason for my question is that i ’ ve been told that cancer is damaged dna that the body doesn ’ t recognize as such.my dna has been damaged by fluoroquinolone toxicity , from what i understands , adducts to my dna can never be removed , are you familiar with this topic , doctor ? my dna was severely damaged by 400 pills of flora quinolones cipro and levaquin , i am near death .. they abduct to our dna. are you familiar with this and any advice .. i eat organic now for 2 years .. am declining .. my thoughts sydneyboo1 is nutritional only . decrease your acidity with baking soda , increase your peptides with probiotic , increase your vitamin k , b12 , e and c to a pharmaceutically significant daily does , and eat protein rich food : eggs , beans , etc . use 1 to 10 dilution of bleach to water to bath your body . and then kiwi or concentrate , antioxidants , cancer , dna damage , fruit , kiwi fruit , oxidative stress , phytonutrients , plant-based diets , vegetables plant-based diets help prevent cancer not only by blocking dna damage but by increasing our dna repair enzymes ’ ability to repair any damage that gets by our first line of antioxidant defense . this is the second video of a three-part series about the latest discoveries on kiwi fruit . see also yesterday 's nutritionfacts.org video-of-the-day kiwifruit for irritable bowel syndrome . other ways to protect one 's dna include eating broccoli , avoiding bacon , not overdoing stevia , and eating a plant-based diet in general . see repairing dna damage and research into reversing aging . in tomorrow 's video plant-based diets and cellular stress defenses we 'll see if we can break through that kiwi ceiling ! in the meanwhile , there are lots ( and i mean lots ) of other videos to peruse .
PLAIN-2939	the leaky gut theory of why animal products cause inflammation the anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based diets is more than just about the power of plants , but the avoidance of animal foods . we ’ ve known for 15 years that a single meal high in animal fat — sausage and egg mcmuffins were used in the original landmark study — can cause a elevation in inflammation within our bodies that peaks at about 4 hours . remember the whole endothelial dysfunction story ? where you can hook people up to a device that can measure the natural dilation of their arteries and blood flow through ultrasound . so as you can see here , within hours of eating animal fat , our arteries get paralyzed , we nearly cut their ability to open normally in half . and that 's not just happening in our arm , the lining of our whole vascular tree gets inflamed , stiffened , crippled . and just as it starts to calm down 5 or 6 hours later , we may whack with another load of meat , eggs , or dairy for lunch such that most of our lives we ’ re stuck in this chronic low-grade inflammation danger zone , which may set us up for inflammatory diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , and certain cancers one meal at a time . does the same thing to our lungs , again , within hours . inflammation in our airways . a single meal with animal fat causing internal damage not just decades down the road but right then and there , that day . what exactly is causing the inflammation , though . well , what is inflammation ? it ’ s an immune response to a perceived threat . what ’ s the body attacking though ? , at first — like in arthritis — scientists thought it might be the animal proteins triggering inflammation , which the body might see as like an invader , whereas the reason plant foods don ’ t trigger inflammation was thought because the body doesn ’ t consider plants a threat . but you can get that same jolt of inflammation just eating whipped cream , there isn ’ t a lot of protein in whipped cream , so attention turned to the fat , the saturated animal fat : butterfat , or lard , tallow , chicken fat , but that still doesn ’ t answer the original question . what is the body attacking ? our immune system doesn ’ t attack just fat . so they dug deeper , analyzing people ’ s blood before and after the meal and found something extraordinary . after a meal of animal products , people suffer from endotoxemia , their bloodstream becomes awash with bacterial toxins , known as endotoxins . ok , well that certainly explains the inflammation . we evolved to be acutely sensitive to bacterial invasion and with this much endotoxin flooding into our system after a meal , our immune system must feel its under assault . ok , but where is it coming from ? well , the researchers knew endotoxin comes from bacteria , and they figured , hey , where is there bacteria ? in our gut . so maybe saturated fat causes our gut lining to become leaky and allow our own bacteria to slip into our blood stream and cause the inflammation . and indeed that ’ s what they found--in mice ; you feed them lard and their guts get leaky . and so for years , the prevailing theory has been that “ saturated fats increase the permeability of intestinal lining and contribute to the breakdown of the intestinal barrier . ” but is that true in people ? stay tuned in the last three videos i relayed the latest on the anti-inflammatory effect of plant-based diets . see achievingremission of crohn ’ s disease , fightinginflammation in a nut shell , and anti-inflammatoryeffects of purple potatoes . the endothelial dysfunction story i mentionin this video is described in the powerof no and the reference to animal proteins and arthritis is explainedin diet & rheumatoid arthritis . stay tuned for tomorrow ’ snutritionfacts.org video-of-the-day , theexogenous endotoxin theory , and in the meanwhile please feel free tocheck out the 1,000 + othertopics i cover.just absolutely fantastic ! from the bottom of my heart , thank you for being such a great teacher ! happy independence day ! even the plants are feeling their independence as they rise above it all ; - } just see below.great video ( again ) . 100 years ago professor pawlov made “ ecks fistel ” . he operated on dogs and he connected vena portae ( blod from the gut ) directly with vena cava inf . ( blod to the heart ) thereby bypassing the liver “ in the first round ” . when the dogs were feed plants nothing happened . when the dogs were feed meat they all died.cooked meat.dogs need raw meat.whats blod ? bloodi can ’ t tell you how amazing this inflammation series is to me . for the 20 years i have had the autoimmune disease of both ears . after having both eardrums replaced my eardrums again reverted back to the pre-surgery thickened state which makes sound conduction impossible . went i went back to my doctor 4 years ago and said , “ ok replace both eardrums again ” he replied that he couldn ’ t because it will just happen again.frustrated i went home and researched acquired atricia , which lead me to autoimmune , and inflammation surfing on google . after the reading research articles and going to various websites i decided a change in diet was the key . my diet had always been healthy with no processed foods but i dropped dairy , sugar , gluten . so my diet was plant based with meat about 4 times per week . strictly organic and grass feed . within 1 ear my doctor replaced my right eardrum and my left 10 months ago . i would estimate i eat meat 1 time per week , if that . when my doctor look at my ears 2 weeks ago he said they look the best they have ever looked . i am thinking 100 % plant based is even better for my autoimmune disease ! dr. greger you are the best ! ( sorry for the typos my ipad is stupid . ) let me clarify that . fish one time per week . i stopped the free range farmers market chicken after your chicken arthritis videos . but now i am thinking , scaling the animal protein down over the last 4years has been what allowed my doctor to replaced my eardrums one last time ! i am thinking vegan for me ! dr greger ( and others ) document over and over again that eating plant based works anti inflammatory . you have demonstrated it yourself . do you have a choice ? no . absolutely not . i love to hear . but what is surprising to me is how dramatic it ’ s been . and also i have done this on my own . i absolutely love my doctor / surgeon he has said gale we don ’ t know but if you cure it we will name the disease after you . it has been a long journey with natural paths , allergists etc. but diet is definitly the key.you know how some doctors will say , “ well of course that person got better they changed from eating junk to improving their diet . ” i havent eaten junk way before my ear issue . my only change was no gluten , ( stomach ache ) no sugar , no dairy and much less animal protein.i am a dr. greger groupie ! you dont want a disease named after you – instead i will propose “ gales cure ” ! ! ! admirable that you did it on your own.by the way : caldwell b. esselstyn md says : moderation kills ! no sugar , no dairy , no ( less ) animal protein is probably a big step from your previous diet ( even if it was considered “ healthy ” ) in my view you cant have a healthy diet if you eat any animal products ( well once in a while probably doesn 't hurt ) i am totally in agreement . i have been completely vegan at times and the thought of eating it would make me giggle with at how absurd the thought was . ( years ago ) but now i just know it ’ s what ’ s best for me . my friends and family already think i am a bit weird with my food restrictions ! one more won ’ t even make them flinch . : - ) the minority is always right , so dont mind what your family and friends think or say . you are a living proof.who cares about them – this is about you ! ! ! ! freedom ! ! ! independence ! ! ! ! living better forever ! ! ! ! keep it up and teach others when they are willing to be taught ! . “ when the student is ready the teacher will appear . ” buddhist proverb.gale , i am wondering how things have been and where you stand with your food-triggers re : ears . certain gluten grains and small amounts of chicken cause piercing ear pain for me . so strange , bizarre . i really wish i understood better the scientific logic as to why this occurs.elsie , i know that i suffer in different ways when i eat certain things . i was taught to rotate my diet every 4 days when i was extremely ill . i was told to keep a food diary for each meal and then write down the symptoms that occurred after each meal . it is called the rotation diet . i made it like a calender and kept it on the refrigerator . i made simple meals so that i could target the foods that caused me problems.all my food had to be fresh … .nothing from a can or a box or package . if i ate eggs for breakfast on monday then i could not have eggs for 4 days . i eliminated all dairy as i was told it was a mucous forming product … no cheese … no yogurt … .. no creamer for coffee . i started feeling better right away ! i found out the foods that caused certain symptoms and if i had to have them i ate them maybe one time a month . my body healed and i continue to follow the rotation diet today . now very few foods bother me.lastly i do juice a couple of times a week now and feel so much energy afterwards.the way we eat is a habit . we were taught our eating patterns . choosing better foods will push out the bad habits and replace them with healthier choices that will help support a healthier immune system.elsie i hope this gets to you . sorry but i never got this reply-i suppose because i actually registered to the website . so to make a long story short – i am doing great and have never been healthier . after this exchange with my favorite doctors i went vegan that day . ( july 4 , 2012 ) i haven ’ t missed meat one bit.so both of my eardrums were replaced as i stated above at the beginning of this thread and that autoimmune disease is behind me ! i actually went swimming in the ocean for the first time a few weeks back which has been off limits in the past.the very curious thing that has happened since going wfpb which i didn ’ t expect is that my thyroid medication has been cut in half . so originally i was on 200mcg of synthroid . i am now down to 100mcg . i just had my blood work done last week so we will see if the dose goes down further . my endocrinologist is by no means an integrated medicine type but her theory is that my gut has healed and i am absorbing more . she doesn ’ t seem to think the thyroid gland has actually healed due to the nature of the disease and the scaring that takes place but who knows ? i have done medline searches and i can ’ t find anything that says “ oh yeah expect your thyroid meds to go down when you become wfpb ” so i will be a case study of 1.by the way : caldwell b. esselstyn md says : moderation kills ! he is not pure vegan . he has done amazing work , but he has admitted to eating some animal products . i love dr. esselstyn , but he does not say , down with meat , eat only plant based … .he does preach some moderation . it is we , the extreme zealots for our own health that take it all the way . : ) kat harrisappreciate this health update . keeps me focused on making good food choices . thank you dr greger.i hope these studies lead to a “ unified theory ” of autoimmune disease – with the goal to “ cure ” these cruel diseases by finding a way to stop the attack on our own bodies . i have not been able to do that with my own autoimmune neuropathy even though i ’ ve been faithful to a fuhrman style high nutrient , gluten free diet for four years . i ’ m still looking for the key even though i ’ m surely better off than i would have been with sad.many people who are intolerant to gluten also can ’ t handle other grains or legumes.great video ! i love research-based nutritional info ! the claim i hear is that animal products won ’ t cause inflammation if people suppliment with probiotics . any truth to this claim ? were these studies taking into account people with good digestive flora when considering inflammation ? i wonder if this is true of all saturated fats ? i eat a lot of coconut and cacao butter – have they tested plant-based saturated fats for the same effect ? the saturated fats a family that varies a bit depending on the number of carbon atoms typically either 5,12 , 14 , 16 or 18 . the body handles these similarly although studies suggest some differences . what is clear that they are all calorically dense foods which contribute to obesity . we don ’ t “ need ” them … we need to consume omega3 and omega6 unsaturated fatty acids . also saturated fats often travel with other natural ( such as cholesterol and animal protein ) see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / plant-protein-preferable / and unnatural compounds ( pcbs , endocrine disrupters , pesticides ) see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dioxins-in-the-food-supply / … which cause other problems and are associated with food borne illnesses . i would recommend applying the precautionary principle and avoiding . eating whole foods and avoiding foods with labels avoids many problems . unfortunately it is impossible to test the saturated fats independently since all oils have a mixture of unsaturated oils.right from the get-go the study is flawed . they used sausage egg mcmuffin and the tested people afterward . inflammation occurred . but since the flour / wheat based muffin was not separated from the sausage we have no way of definitively knowing weather it was the muffin or the meat that caused the inflammation . wheat is a known inflammatory . you may as well have told all the participants to wear blue shirts , eat the egg mcmuffin and the tested them . you could just as easily conclude that wearing blue shirts causes arterial inflammation as the sausage did based on the method of this study.i eat a plantbased diet . but i was wondering the exact same thing . also the bacon and eggs would have been cooked in polyunsaturated oils , which causes more inflammation in the body than organic saturated fats from grass fed animals . “ nutrition and physical degeneration ” by weston a price 1930 ’ s show.31 completely isolated peoples around the world had one thing in common.no tooth decay ( less than 1 % of combined population ) no crooked teeth ( aka crowding of the teeth , narrowed jaw line ) no other hindrances in bodily bones structures . no difficulties in birthing ( women commonly have wider pelvic bone region , giving birth was super quick , was common for women to gave birth in solitude . ) virtually disease free ( tuberculosis was not present ) common similarites within these people are … . high intake vitamins , minerals , water soluable and most importantly fat soluble vitamins ( fat soluables were 5x to 8x higher than typical intakes of big cities ) why ? their stewardship with the land was much different than commonly found in the many depleting characteristics of agriculture ) be united ! be be united ! a preview of the book is available in bittorrent form , mp3 audio book is great for my busy lifestyle.i agree this study is flawed and driven by a zealot like need to present information unfairly . animal fats are good because they have hdl which are good . carbs , sugar , unsaturated fats like vegetable oil , canola oils are the killers.the notion that dietary fat causes endothelial dysfunction is only a conditional truth , not a necessary one.most people have poor lipid metabolism . maybe if you don ’ t have poor lipid metabolism you don ’ t get lipotoxicity of the endothelium when you eat fat , and the fact that low carbohydrate diets don ’ t cause endothelial damage supports that because they improve lipid metabolism. http : / / gazette.jhu.edu / 2011 / 08 / 01 / low-carb-high-fat-diets-add-no-arterial-health-risks-to-obese / but say you do have poor lipid metabolism and don ’ t want to eat low carb or low fat ? are you screwed until you improve your lipid metabolism ? not really , it looks like having enough nitric oxide around to help properly dilate the blood vessels and having high levels of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants totally prevents this phenomenon , rendering it a total moot point.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11165454http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16896723also omega-3 will automatically improve fatty acid oxidation http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20555373 probably by enhancing ppar activity.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11679024http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 12018880http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9388088so basically everything prevents lipids from damaging the arteries . if your arteries don 't function properly and can ’ t respond to changes in the contents of circulation than you may have a problem . i can ’ t stress enough the notion of context . some nutrients prevent damage to the body , and some of them do it by helping the body transport other nutrients safely . you always want to go look for things that falsify your hypothesis and show that a nutrient is not harmful under certain circumstances , especially circumstances that we should be obtaining anyway like exercising , eating foods with antioxidants , getting enough nitric oxide precursors , etc.as for endotoxemia , it is true that dietary fat can potentially cause leaky gut , and so can glucose ( i ’ m not seeing any suggestions to stop eating whole wheat bread though … ) but orange juice doesn ’ t . why ? the researchers have figures this out , during their digestion macronutrients produce oxidative stress which damages the gut lining , and so orange juice with its high concentration of flavanoids will prevent this and then some . does that mean switch your fat and bread to orange juice only ? well no , you could have all 3 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20200256 orange juice , a piece of toast , and eggs for breakfast , without endotoxemia ? gasp ! you could easily find this paper in the side bar on pubmed where the paper in the video was taken from . imagine that ! it looks like it is desirable to have something rich in antioxidants during a meal , and everyone should be doing this , so it becomes a moot point whether or not glucose of fat will cause leaky gut by themselves . it ’ s easily preventable , and everyone who has a good diet will be unscathed by glucose and fat . spices , vegetables , fruits , all of that can be expected to protect the gut lining from normal damage during a meal.one tip that i picked up for going to parties where they serve food without antioxidants is to carry some grape seed extract or resveratrol in my pocket http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 21289251i am glad to have been able to save you all from a fat-less , glucose-without-antioxidant-less existence . > > spices , vegetables , fruits , all of that can be expected to protect the gut lining from normal damage during a meal . < < " expectation " is generally not considered to constitute strong evidence , so i don 't put any faith in the above . spices – i doubt that peppercorns and various other " hot " condiments are gut-friendly , as many people complain of irritation with these spices . stabby , the natural world is a dangerous neighborhood and many plants contain toxicants , having evolved them as a means of defense against predation . case-by-case is the way to go , imo , with particular attention to dose . [ black peppercorns contain safrole , a carcinogen at sufficiently high doses ] . how friendly are plants ? here 's bruce ames : http : / / toxicology.usu.edu / endnote / 05012008011.pdfwell of course i meant that the ones that could be demonstrated to have high antioxidant activity in the same way that orange juice does , not all of them . i should have been more clear there.also agreed on the fact that plants have toxins . more natural ones than synthetic ones from agriculture . all in all i think that there is little risk to most vegetables , fruits , and spices and much benefit . the notion of toxicity as a major source of disease needs to be pit against the ability of the body to protect itself , detoxify , and such . and some foods with toxins , even some toxins like polyphenols , can be our best friends in that regard . turmeric has toxins but the net effect on our antioxidant and toxin metabolizing enzymes is very positive.but i ’ m not going to say that all plants that we regard as food are benign , no way.glad to hear it . and it is similarly irrational and unproductive to vilify animal foods , imo . but that seems to be an important theme here . too bad.agreed , i ’ m actually just here because someone posted this on facebook and i was aware of the issue and the whole story , that both glucose and fat produce ros and leaky gut as they get digested and flavanoids like those in orange juice can prevent it.i find that a lot of the supposed problems with “ animal foods ” are eliminated by eating a whole diet that is healthy in general . there is a synergy in a diet between many foods , and if it looks like we ’ re not adapted to a particular food it ’ s not always that simple , we can ’ t be said to be adapted to a particular food or maladapted to it , but to entire diets.and i recognize the nutritional usefulness of “ animal foods ” and so i always look for a way in which a potential problem with certain ones could be avoided in order to benefit from a more diverse diet.haha. awesome . thanks . : - ) what i get from this is that you can eat foods that are apparently harmful , harmful being defined as causing inflammation , as long as you consume antioxidants with that meal . would you then presume that these high antioxidant meals merely act as a buffer to the inflammation , and that this reduction in inflammation merely reaches a baseline , or close to it . to summarize what i am trying to say , consuming an inflammatory food with a high antioxidant food may buffer the inflammation , but eliminating this highly inflammatory food altogether and consuming only ant-inflammitory foods would be more beneficial in that there is no need to buffer , freeing the antioxidants to ease oxidative stress in other cells . buffering has already been established when it comes to consuming kale juice and smoking , but i don ’ t see this as an excuse to smoke as long as you consume kale juice as well as other high antioxidant foods.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / smoking-versus-kale-juice / none of these studies “ prove ” that the saturated fat is causing this inflammatory response . the products consumed in these studies include meat , dairy , eggs , grains . one of the biggest confounding variables of all the mentioned studies is the fact that they don ’ t test saturated fat alone . saponins , protease inhibitors , and lectins are in products such as dairy , grains , and legumes – these are all components proven to permeablize the gut , causing bacterial translocation , leading to those low levels of chronic inflammation . saturated fat hasn ’ t been scientifically shown to produce this affect . further studies testing the fat alone must be conducted before the interpretation that saturated fat causes a leaky can be made . yep , and where are the tests of the many plant sources of sat.fat ? and how much sat.fat is there in chicken breast-meat ? almost none.and , for that matter , despite the appeal of the hypothesis , many 100s of millions of major endotoxin eaters live long , healthy , happy lives , free of apparent inflammatory disease . and weren ’ t some of the alleged longest-lived human cultures those who guzzled fermented milk products ? re a heart attack or stroke , we are far from quantifying or even assigning causality here . good point about saponins — it ’ d be interesting to see the effects on acute inflammation of eating an oz or two of alfalfa sprouts — they ’ re loaded with alfalfa saponins.i truly do love this site , and frequently recommend it in my work , and appreciate the work dr. greger is doing . however , at times i get frustrated with some of the postings . i find the premise of the site – that a vegan diet is superior in every way , for every one – to be a completely unfounded , and potentially dangerous , inference to make as a universal recommendation . there are many sound indigenous diets that incorporate animal products daily . yes , for some people vegan diets maximize their biochemical capacities . however , for others ( i would argue the majority ) they do not . i have seen many folks blood work , mood , and overall vitality improve with the inclusion of high-quality animal products . i have also seen myriad folks wilt on a vegan diet , and fight it until they again include some animals products and are reanimated – in spirit and blood markers . i don ’ t believe there is a single panacea diet as each individual must be regarded in terms of their composition , level of activity , goals , and age . no two people are alike . we cannot trap patients within physicians ’ philosophical orientations . this particular posting features articles based on people eating mcdonald ’ s egg mcmuffins and then posits that all animal fat triggers inflammation ? this is absurd . how is fastfood animal fat , or industrial farmed animal products , necessarily indicative of all animal fat ? how can folks simply conflate degree and kind ? for example , grass-fed beef is not the same as mcdonald ’ s beef . there are shades of ambiguity that a physician must navigate . if human diet recommendations were so black and white , then we would have never survived as a species as evolution hinges on adaptation . i ’ m sincerely not trying to be disrespectful , i ’ m just merely highlighting that medicine and health care require a hermeneutical keenness that frees individual patients from becoming abstracted generalities . yes it is easier to provide care if you have the “ right ” answer but that doesn ’ t necessarily make one a good physician or health advocate . we need to be open to the possibility that because patients are different , they thrive in different ways . this is the foundation of patient-centered care . i digress … the reason dr. greger promotes a vegan diet so strongly is because there is an abundance of evidence that animal foods do indeed increase our risk for chronic illnesses and when one is trying to reverse a chronic illness animal foods only hurt , not help the treatment / reversal of this disease . for example , the inclusion of a single serving of meat in a week when trying to treat type 2 diabetes significantly regresses the treatment. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2677007in this day and age , healthy populations are increasingly hard to find . the inuits even who have a meat centric diet live on average 10 years less then the average american . the okinawans on the other hand who had almost a totally plant based diet with the inclusion of a small amount of meat have the most centenarians per capita in their population . i am not sure if they have been westernized but this data was taken back from the 1950 ’ s.caloric restriction , the traditional okinawan diet , and healthy aging : the diet of the world ’ s longest-lived people and its potential impact on morbidity and life span.table 1 . traditional dietary intake of okinawans and other japanese circa 1950total calories 1785 total weight ( grams ) 1262 caloric density ( calories / gram ) 1.4 total protein in grams ( % total calories ) 39 ( 9 ) total carbohydrate in grams ( % total calories ) 382 ( 85 ) total fat in grams ( % total calories ) 12 ( 6 ) saturated fatty acid 3.7 monounsaturated fatty acid 3.6 polyunsaturated fatty acid 4.8 total fiber ( grams ) 23food group weight in grams ( % total calories ) grains rice 154 ( 12 ) wheat , barley , and other grains 38 ( 7 ) nuts , seeds < 1 ( < 1 ) sugars 3 ( < 1 ) oils 3 ( 2 ) legumes ( e.g. , soy and other beans ) 71 ( 6 ) fish 15 ( 1 ) meat ( including poultry ) 3 ( < 1 ) eggs 1 ( < 1 ) dairy < 1 ( < 1 ) vegetablessweet potatoes 849 ( 69 ) other potatoes 2 ( < 1 ) other vegetables 114 ( 3 ) fruit < 1 ( < 1 ) seaweed 1 ( < 1 ) pickled vegetables 0 ( 0 ) foods : flavors & alcohol 7 ( < 1 ) data derived from analysis of u.s. national archives , archived food records , 1949 and based on survey of 2279 persons.some points : their diet was 85 % carb , and 6 % fat . sweet potatoes ( a japanese sweet potato ) made up almost 70 % of their calories . nuts were less than 1 % of calories ( the equivalent of 1 / 10 of an ounce a day ) oil was less than 2 % of calories ( which is about 1 tsp a day ) and sugars were less than 1 % of calories ( less than a tsp a day ) the total animal products including fish was less than 4 % of calories which is less then 70 calories a day . that is the equivalent of around 2 oz of animal products or less a day. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17986602furthermore , we understand more and more what specific nutrients in animal foods are harmful and the mechanics behind this . as this mountain of knowledge continues to build , it becomes more clear that a plant based diet is indeed truly superior to any other diet out there.yeah , sweet potatoes made up the bulk of their calories .. not grains.grains have been implicated in only positive health attributes , and most major cultures of the world have a starch , including grains , that they thrive on . you cannot try and argue this philosophically with me , provide some science based evidence for your claims.great video . thank you for all the hard work and effort you make to deliver us the best of science about nutrition . i ’ m huge fan of your work for quite a long time.but back to video . reminds me your previous video titled “ soymilk suppression ? ” . i ’ ve heard that black tea is product of fermentation , so i wonder if it could contains some amount of endotoxin . due to that if dairy or soy milk is added to tea and is known to block some properties of that tea i wander if that mechanism could be somehow connected with endotoxin . moreover i ’ m interesting where this endotoxin is actualy absorbed ? would it be in the stomach ? and if so , is it especially saturated fat that enhance this absorption , or would it be any kind fo fat ? i ’ m curious if there is any studies that measured andotoxin level after saturated and unsaturated fat cansumption . and finally , what about another fermented foods ? i know that endotoxin is mainly produced by gram-negative bacteria , so what about vinegar for example ? thank you once again and looking forward to your answer.i have been reading a lot about this paleo diet ( not that i would ever eat meat again ) , but i do have a couple of questions – mark sisson and co have been saying that it isn ’ t animal products , but grains that are inflammatory . this ( they say ) results from wheat trying to protect itself from being eaten and releasing toxins that the body can ’ t break down . is there any truth to this ? also they are talking about people becoming “ fat-adapted ” http : / / www.marksdailyapple.com / what-does-it-mean-to-be-fat-adapted-part-2-qa / # ixzz20g2qimszdoes this happen ? is it a good thing ? and does the difference of grass-fed cows make a huge difference and actually lower the chance for heart disease ? these are all claims that i have been wondering about.the paleo diet relies heavily on pseudo science . dr. greger actually covers this diet in his free e book here with over a thousand references http : / / www.atkinsexposed.org / wheat does indeed have these antinutrients , or so called “ toxins ” in them . but that ’ s only half the story , because cooking deactivates these anti-nutrients which include lectins , phytic acid , trypsin and α-amylase inhibitors . this is fairly well established common nutritional knowledge.as far as inflammation goes , we have here , strong scientific evidence that endotoxins cause inflammation with laboratory tests to confirm this . we now understand the majority of the mechanics behind it . again , the paleo diet advocates make assertions without good evidence or half truths . they commonly look at the inuits as their role models or other tribes , such as the maaize , living on a meat centric diet . what they fail to mention is that the inuits live 10 years less then the average american and that the maaize live on average till about the age of 45 . the concept of trying to live like our ancestors is appealing , but these short life expectancies are something i do not idolize . this same logic can be seen with many raw foodists who also use this argument of trying to live like our ancestors.i ’ m not paleo , but i am a health researcher and the concepts of paleo are not pseudo science . why is it that gut healing diets are all centered around cutting out grains and legumes and eating bone broth , meats and veggies … and why do the majority of people heal eating this way … ? i unfortunately know too many former vegan who are eating a paleo diet bc of poor health that they developed as a vegan . i think it comes down to ur personal biochemistry . and , what ’ s unhealthy about a natural diet of veg , fruits , nuts , fish , eggs , meats ? everything in moderation , peeps ? ! the concept of moderation is killing americans . on average , americans are taking in less than 40 % of the minimum recommended amounts of whole grains , vegetables , fruits and fiber . yet , at the same time , they are taking in over 230 % of the amount of sat fat , added sugars , fats , refined grains and sodium.so , who can moderate ? moderation would do absolutely nothing to improve these numbers.what we do need is a dramatic increase in the amount of fruits , vegetables and whole grains while at the same time a dramatic decrease in the amount of sat fat , added sugars , fats , refined grains and sodium.moderation is only an excuse and rationalization which is being fueled by the clever marketing and advertising of the food industry to keep us doing the things we know we shouldn ’ t be doing and to keep us consuming their products , which in the end , is actually a major contributor to our ill health and early death.we are all humans , and i do believe while humans can eat a number of foods , there is indeed an optimal diet , and the evidence strongly points towards a plant based diet , not a diet with lots of fish , eggs and other meat.if you can provide evidence for you claims that would be greatly appreciated , as a health researcher i would think you would expect others to go off of true science rather than personal anecdotes about vegans converting to eat a paleolithic diet . moderation really has little value if it is not defined how much moderation is . 1 egg a day , a week , a month ? eggs are considered good sources of lutein and omega 3 and an excellent source of protein . for these reasons , they are considered health foods . firstly , chickens only have lutein due to the fact that they have a varietized feed , these nutrients are not inherent of eggs . a spoonful of spinach has as much lutein as 9 eggs . we cannot really consider eggs an appropriate source of this nutrient . as for protein , all whole foods are complete sources of protein so this statement to its benefits is insignificant . energy needs satisfy energy expenditures which is equivalent to protein needs . as long as you eat whole plant foods when your hungry till your full , then your getting enough protein.regarding omega 3 , current levels of omega 3 in eggs are highly inadequate and one must consume around 30 eggs to reach an acceptable level of omega 3 for the day . a male needs around 1.6 grams of omega 3 per day , a female needs around 1.1 grams a day . omega 3 processes to epa which is also processed to dha , which is highly anti inflammatory . omega 6 processes down to arachadonic acid which is highly inflammatory . the fact that eggs are the top source of arachadonic acid nulls and voids benefits received from the omega 3 in the egg itself . high intake of arachadonic acid is linked to autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis , ulcerative colitis , as well as a clear link with cancer development.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed ?

tool = pubmedfurthermore , in the canadian journal of cardiology , david spence , david jenkins ( the inventor of the glycemic index ) and jean davignon ( director of atherosclerosis research group ) posted a review on eggs claiming that the egg industry has been downplaying the health risks of eggs through misleading advertisements . as soon as you eat one egg , you expose your body to several hours worth of oxidative stress , inflammation of ones arteries , endothelieum impairment ( what keeps you blood running smoothly ) and increases the susceptibility of ldl cholesterol to oxidize ( beginning stages of heart disease ) .http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 21076725http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9001684the egg industry has claimed that cholesterol from eggs is not important and does not raise cholesterol levels . the fundamental flaw in the study the egg industry has used to make this claim is that they measured fasting lipid levels at night and not levels through out the day after egg consumption . “ diet is not all about fasting lipids ; it is mainly about the three-quarters of the day that we are in the nonfasting state . fasting lipids can be thought of as a baseline ; they show what the endothelium was exposed to for the last few hours of the night . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2989358 / ? tool = pubmeda single egg yolk contains approximately 215 to 275 mg of cholesterol . a safe upper limit can be capped at 200 mg if one is looking to prevent heart disease . one egg far exceeds this daily upper limit.fish is also , by far , the most contaminated animal product one can eat . these contaminants take years to leave the body , so why ingest a steady stream of these pollutants ? dr. greger has gathered much of the research on harms seen with animal product consumption . if you are truly interested in delving further , explore this website.i dont have time to argue or post studies .. ost of these studies that dr g posts are not based on grass fed meats , natural whole foods , or healthy diets … . they are done with processed foods . thus , u cannot compareand why do more people heal their guts and autoimmune issues going paleo vs vegan ? the opposite is true , in fact . those on a meat centric diet tend to have much more severe cases of autoimmune diseases as well as more severe ibs . where is your evidence ? there are an abundance of studies showing that a vegan diet can significantly alleviate , if not reverse rheumatoid arthritis . meat has been implicated in making this disease more aggressive.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11177171http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 10479237http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9566667http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 1681264http : / / rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org / content / 36 / 1 / 64.longhttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 7986787http : / / rheumatology.oxfordjournals.org / content / 40 / 10 / 1175.shorthttp : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11890437http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11252685http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 11156742need i go further ? regardless of organic vs conventional , there are inherent compounds found in meat , from xenoestrogens in milk , to too much preformed arachidonic acid in eggs and chicken , as well as endotoxins found in all animal foods and a spike in igf-1 which leads to cancer promotion in all animal foods as well.modern meat compared with wild game still produced an inflammatory response , so we cannot view meat as a healthy food on all fronts.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20377925whether they be organic or not , these compounds still exist , so again , where is your evidence . stating that “ why do more people heal their guts and autoimmune issues going paleo vs vegan ? ” is not evidence , as this is simply a statement backed without science.if you truly are a nutritional researcher i would think you would hold yourself to a higher standard for evidence.it ’ s not the absence of meat , but the presence of more vegetables that causes healing on a “ vegan ” diet . add more vegetables to your meat diet and you ’ ll have the same effect . comparing a vegan diet with an egg mc muffin ( and calling it “ meat ” ) is like comparing a meat diet with soy milk ( and calling it a “ vegan ” diet ) despite the government shoving the whole grain food pyramid diet down everyones throat , people still can ’ t adhere to it . go tell an indigenous tribe that they ’ re unhealthy for eating meat . except .. they all look like olympic athletes or lightweight boxers.hi , do you know if sprouted or even just soaked beans are ok to help heal the gut ? thxwhat you failed to mention .. is that the short life expectancy is due to being eaten by a lion or tiger or polar bear .. or getting a cut , getting an infection and not having emergency medical care . falling and breaking their leg .. etc . not from diet . diabetes , heart disease , stroke are nearly unheard of in indigenous tribes . the ones that do survive to old age are still active and have the body composition of an olympic athlete . have you watched any shows like beyond survival with les stroud ? do you see any of the old tribesman that are obese ? no because they don ’ t exist . do you see them injecting themselves with insulin or talking about their diabetes and strokes ? no because they don ’ t have those problems . do you see how they ’ re ripped and shredded with straight up 8 packs and rippling muscles ? you ’ re telling me that ’ s unhealthy ? it ’ s interesting that an anthropologist can tell the difference between a western modern skeleton and an old skeleton just by looking at bone density and teeth . their bones are thicker , their teeth are stronger and have way fewer cavities . hmm … what tribesman in modern society do you know of , other then the inuits who live 10 years less then americans , follow a meat centered diet and that have a lifespan comparable with those of the us.i ’ m not sure . i ’ m not against meat but am positive that the only healthy meat , and even then in limited quantities , and according to medicinal need , are those with good immunity . that would mean animals caught in the wild , according to season , environment , and their diet , are the only ones edible . for the average person , chinese medicine says animal products should be about 5 % of your diet . seems about right to me but only if one could get ‘ em as natural as one could thousands of years ago.i think an important addition to this discussion is the importance of the lymphatic system and it ’ s primary functions , particularly regarding inflammation in the gut . the video cut short of explaining how the body would prefer to deal with toxins and harmful bacteria from anything we consume . sadly , it is still poorly understood , but we do know that it is the primary method of fat absorption from the small intestine . furthermore , it is the “ platform ” for the immune system ( most people will have experienced swollen lymph nodes during illness ) where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated . detoxification is yet another important function , where the absorption of nutrients must ( should ) first pass through the liver before entering the bloodstream . compromising this design with a leaky gut obviously allows toxins and bacteria to enter the bloodstream directly , without a filter , so to speak . naysayer here . you ’ ve been warned . first off the study cited in the beginning of the video cuts off the rest of the so called “ high-fat meal ” just plainly stating that an egg mcmuffin and sausage mcmuffin are part of the meal . i would personally like to see the entirety of the meal composition . without that knowledge however we ’ ll just move ahead with what the video showed us . the main culprit according to the theory advocated here is saturated fat causes inflammation and gut permeability . let ’ s break this meal down and see if this study points us towards this conclusion . so the meal had 14 grams of saturated fat total . that leaves 36 grams of fat that is either polyunsaturated or monounsaturated . so right off the bat most of the fat is coming from polyunsaturates and monounsaturated fats . not a good start but lets keep on cruising . this coming from snack-girl.com an egg mcmuffin contains : 300 calories , 12 g fat , 30 g carbohydrates , 18 g protein , 2 g fiber , 820 mg sodium . fair enough . immediately i notice that there is more than double the amount of carbohydrates in an egg mcmuffin then there are fats . hmm … what about the sausage mcmuffin ? well this coming from foodfacts.com : 22 g total fat , 8 g saturated . cool … so 14 g are both polyunsaturated and monounsaturated . most of the fat again in this meal so far have been poly ’ s or mono ’ s . good to know . run on sentence warning : forgetting about the fact that the wheat and soy are some of the most allergenic substances known to man and have been gmo ’ d beyond all recognition and that both wheat and soy constitute a large amount of both the egg and sausage mcmuffin , and that the egg was prepared with liquid margarine containing the following ingredients , again taken from snack-girl.com : liquid soybean oil , water , partially hydrogenated soybean oil , salt , hydrogenated cottonseed oil , soy lecithin , mono-and diglycerides , sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate ( preservatives ) , artificial flavor , citric acid , vitamin a palmitate , beta carotene ( color ) , and forgetting that hydrogenated oils aka trans fats are more pro-inflammatory that the fires of hell , and that processed vegetable oil consumption has increased along with greater incidences of heart disease over the past 50 years , let ’ s just assume that the voice behind the video is telling the truth when he mind numb-ingly states that saturated fat is the cause of inflammation and leaky gut when most of the meal didn ’ t even constitute saturated fat but instead polyunsaturated vegetable oil and hydrogenated soybean oil ( polyunsaturated oil heated to incredible temperatures so that hydrogen may bond to it increasing shelf life and the temperature at which the oil burns or smokes ) and that 450 calories of the entire meal were either carbs or protein . mostly carbohydrates . easily digestible , incredibly denatured processed and refined carbohydrates . the kind that breaks down like sugar in the body and spikes insulin production leading to fat storage and an inflammatory response incited thereof . so most of what comprises this meal which the scientists cited in the study and which the narrator used as proof for his theory and disinformation is refined carbs , processed polyunsaturated highly unstable unfit for human consumption vegetable oils , and hydrogenated oils which often get lumped into the saturated fat category when in reality are in a league of their own under trans fats . let me just be frank and speak common sense . the food came from mcdonald ’ s that was used in the study cited in the first part of this video . they , mcdonald ’ s , makes the cost on their end as low as possible and charge the consumer as much as possible to make a profit . refined carbs and processed vegetable oils are cheap . they add bulk and preserve the product . it really isn ’ t food in a sense that it nourishes you . it ’ s crap . most of it isn ’ t even saturated animal fat . most of the food served in that place is refined carbs , sugar , and pro-inflammatory oils . use your brain . why would a food that has been nourishing humans for thousands of years ( saturated animal fat ) all of a sudden be bad for us ? look at human mothers milk . most of the fats are saturated . absurdity aptly abbreviates appropriately all abundantly . moving on , the study cited at around the 2 : 15 mark stated that whipped cream jolts inflammation . there is a graph with tlr4 in mnc ( mononuclear cells ) in the vertical section and cream , notice it doesn ’ t say whipped cream like the narrator said , glucose , oj , and water along the horizontal . wtf is tlr4 ? well it ’ s a troll-like receptor . it is part of the immune system . it attaches to microbes or endotoxins . according to the narrator fats cause the bloodstream to be flooded with endotoxins originating from the gut , or so the theory goes . what about the cream ? undoubtedly is was pasteurized and came from cows sitting in their own dung hence the need for pasteurization . also the diet of the milk cow is corn and soy which makes the cow produce lots of milk . it ’ s sold by the gallon not by the quantity of nutrients . cows typically eat grass in a normal setting . normal cow milk is high in clas ( conjugated linoleic acids ) and omega-3s . machine cows produce high omega-6 milk with traces of pesticides and antibiotics . the cream then being pasteurized , littered with dead microbe bodies , and omega six fatty acids will obviously stimulate an immune response as all cooked food does . kind of hard to recognize natural things in our bodies when we keep messing with their structure and composition . as for the leaky gut i ’ m appalled at the stretch that was made . fat causes the gut to leak ? our gut is made out of fat ! stress , sugar , alcohol , and processed vegetable oil causes our gut to leak not to mention a severe lack of the building blocks of the gut which would help our body patch up the holes ! flora imbalance , antibiotics , nsaids ( ibuprofen ) , are factors in leaky gut . here is the deal . whoever wrote the script for this video knew it was bogus . so i ’ m going to talk to the poor innocent souls who believe such lies . don ’ t buy into this so quickly . do your own research . believe me , there are people who will lie right to your face . they have an agenda and your health and education aren ’ t part of it . use common sense . don ’ t be a mind controlled robot . your body needs saturated fats . your brain requires cholesterol in abundance . the mcdonald ’ s meal doesn ’ t prove that saturated fats are evil . it just proves that mcdonald ’ s doesn ’ t have the healthiest food . anyone with half a brain knows that . this video is pure misinformation persuading you away from the truth so that you may be perpetually under the weather so to speak . ask yourself this : what did people eat before all of these new diseases started popping up ? why didn ’ t they get the same diseases ? what did they eat and what changed in our diet that made us sick ? if you want a wake up call and an end to the bs like the video above check this out : http : / / vimeo.com / 10533993 sorry about the sloppiness of the writing and the hastiness of the point making and the grittiness of the presentation . it ’ s late , i ’ m tired but i can ’ t let stuff like this go unchallenged . all it takes for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing . seriously though folks . use your brain . anybody with a microphone and some video editing software can make a video and present all of what they say as the gospel of truth . doesn ’ t make it so . it took me one video to see through this whole website . now i just laugh at their insidious lies and pathetic attempts at brainwashing . you can fool some people some of the time but you can ’ t fool all the people all the time . good luck out there . it ’ s a mad world. go eat 500 calories of sat fat then take a hard run , lemme know how it works out for you. doosh.http : / / eatingacademy.com / why-i-decided-to-lose-weightok . i just had a fat ribeye and did 2 hours of martial arts . whats your point ? dr. greger , did this study include fish ? is the endotoxemia effect seen from the injection of fish as well as meat and eggs ? if this study did not take into account fish injestion , is there any research that does ? no , this study did not include fish . i have not seen any research on fish and endotoxemia.i haven ’ t considered an egg mcmuffin food for many years . come on.any dairy will cause me incredible pain after an hour or two . i have cut out all dairy , including casein and whey . it takes 100 % participation to notice a difference , since any small amount causes me great pain . i have to read food packages carefully , since it seems like so many things contain dairy , like bread products . i have been dairy free for over a year now and would never go back to dairy ! my mother has osteoarthritis and has had both hips replaced in the last 2 years . i am 54 and was on the same path according to my doctor before i changed my diet and went dairy free . it has literally changed my life.i have granuloma annulare . has any research demonstrated a definite correlation between leaky gut syndrome and this autoimmune affliction ?

grass . we ’ re animals what should we eat ? plants.true. i almost had a heart attack i was headed for it . i had a cardiologist and everything . decided to live life . quit my job , ate plant based , did yoga . 10 months later i ’ m 40 pounds lighter , i can breathe , my chest isn ’ t tight . vegetables and fruit that ’ s it ! you will feel like another person . i ’ m happy , my wife is very happy , my kids are happy . the mood swings are gone and my mind is back in a good place.shawn : great story ! thanks for taking the time to share it with us.dr. greger , i just found a new study which seems to say that there ’ s no difference in the way arteries react a diet that is high in saturated fat , mono-saturated fat or carbohydrates . can you explain this apparent contradiction ? http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23964054it would be nice to get an update from the doctor regarding the flaw in this study.the egg mcmuffin was eaten with an english muffin ; wheat is a known inflammatory.white flour yes , but whole wheat is antiinflammatory. http : / / ajcn.nutrition.org / content / 70 / 3 / 459s.full.pdfegg mcmuffins use white flour … so is this study compromised ? no , because the mechanism of saturated fat is still understood as a gut transport . white flour does not contain appreciable amounts of saturated fat.it sounds like you ’ re saying that the study is proof until someone points out the problem with mixing in confounding variables , and then the study methology doesn ’ t matter because you just know it ’ s the fat . if the study can ’ t prove anything then why even use it as evidence ? campbell found wheat caused more inflammation and disease than meat did and he found no association with animal fat at all . if we know that white flour is very inflammatory , then pointing to meat studies that include white flower wouldn ’ t make any sense if you ’ re trying to prove that meat causes inflammation.according to the usda nutrient database , whole wheat is inflammatory too and most meat is not.the database does not take into account the phytonutrient profile of a food which significantly dictates its inflammatory property . regardless of what the database says , we have abundant proof that meat is inflammatory , and you can search this site to find more studies to show this . the usda databse provides useful information of a nutrient profile but does a poor job of dictating if a food is healthy or not . for example , all fruits are listed as being “ too high in sugar ” , yet we know the fiber provides a slower release and studies do not show fruit consumption linked with disease , but the opposite.dr. greger summarizes some of this here.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2012 / 09 / 20 / why-meat-causes-inflammation / in this study , overweight subjects were fed a diet that included either refined wheat or whole wheat . ( 3 bread slices , 2 crisp bread slices , 1 portion muesli , and 1 portion pasta ) after 6 weeks there was no difference at all in their insulin sensitivity or inflammatory markers . the whole wheat was just as inflammatory as the refined wheat.j. nutr . june 2007 vol . 137 no . 6 1401-1407i ’ m trying to see what you mean about all fruits being too high in sugar according to the database , but i don ’ t find that . they give a cup of apple a glycemic load of 3 which is pretty darn low . i checked papaya too since i ’ m eating some right now and that was only a 3 as well . can you reference an example of that too high in sugar warning to help me understand ? from the nutrition facts of an apple : “ the bad : a large portion of the calories in this food come from sugars. http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / fruits-and-fruit-juices / 1809 / 2 # ixzz2xhurkyufwhole wheat bread may be a poor example due to its easy digestibility when compared with less easily digested grains ( ex. brown rice , wheat berries , oats , quinoa , etc . ) http : / / www.healthgrain.org / webfm _ send / 251the insulin spikes are similar with whole wheat flour , as cracked wheat or wheat berries are digested much slower.toxins , the usda provides the nutrient data . i do see the quote you shared when i click the link , but that comment is coming from self magazine , the host of that particular calculator . and even though the heading reads , “ the bad : ” , the statement about the bulk of the calories coming from sugar is an accurate one . above that it also says “ the good : this food is very low in saturated fat , cholesterol and sodium . it is also a good source of dietary fiber and vitamin c ” . that seems like a pretty balanced description . they have to treat each food as though it is going to be eaten in isolation unless or until you add something else . i didn ’ t find anything there that suggested to me that the reader was being advised to avoid eating them . please let me know if you interpret that differently . you said it is the phytonutrients that make whole wheat anti-inflammatory , and i don ’ t understand how the phytonutrient content changes when the wheat is ground . it still contains the same fiber and phytonutrients . it wasn ’ t only flour-based versions that the participants ate , they also ate muesli which is usually a whole grain ( as in unground ) food . most cultures that eat a diet high in whole wheat eat it in the form of bread too and i ’ ve seen other comments of yours suggesting that the high amount of wheat is partly responsible for the health of those cultures in other threads . if you ’ re claiming that whole wheat is anti-inflammatory , where refined wheat is inflammatory , i see no evidence of that.i agree that the insulin spikes are the same whether the wheat is whole or refined , but if diabetes is about inflammation and dietary fat , then the glycemic impact shouldn ’ t matter because this effect should be reduced if the whole wheat has anti-inflammatory properties . this study didn ’ t show that at all.phaedra : you wrote , “ i don ’ t understand how the phytonutrient content changes when the wheat is ground . it still contains the same fiber and phytonutrients . ” i once saw a talk from brenda davis , rd where she showed nutrition levels for grains going down as the grains were processed more . flour was the lowest . ( sprouted intact grain was the highest . ) rightly or wrongly , i interpreted that to mean that when you process a grain , such as grinding it up into flour , the substance starts to loose its nutrition . just like say , when you pick a fruit or veggie from the plant , it starts a decline in nutrition that continues over time.just a thought for you.good point , thea . i ’ ve never heard of brenda davis , but i don ’ t doubt that there are differences in the raw ingredients , especially in the unstable fatty acids . but since you have to cook grain to make it edible , and the cooking reduces many phytonutrients far more than milling , ( ie : phytate ) , i ’ d be more interested in the nutrient content of the finished foods . i know of lots of people who freshly grind wheat berries when they bake , in the interest of preserving nutrients , but then eat the bread over the course of several days , meaning the grain is still several days past grinding and losing nutrients by the minute . i also know of many who soak and cook up a pot of whole grain on the weekend and then portion it out over the week . i believe i even watched one if doc greger ’ s videos that encouraged this , but i ’ m not sure . i think that if you consider that leaving grain whole also makes the nutrients less available because the intact cellulose reduces digestibility , it seems like six of one or a half dozen of the other.considering the way most people eat whole grains , i can ’ t see how whether they are whole or ground makes much if any difference in the phytonutrient content of the cooked and edible form – and if the argument is going to be made that whole wheat is anti-inflammatory , does that refer only to the boiled form ? and if so , what is the evidence that it really is anti-inflammatory ? i can ’ t seem to find any data that shows that any form of wheat has an anti-inflammatory effect at all . most data makes reference to “ whole grains ( plural ) ” and doesn ’ t look at wheat alone.if you go to the official “ inflammation factor ” site [ http : / / inflammationfactor.com / look-up-if-ratings / ] and put “ wheat ” into the search feature , the58 entries and the only anti-inflammatory forms are germ and bran , everything else is inflammatory including whole buckwheat ( which isn ’ t technically wheat ) . there is also an article there that explains that they recently asked nutritiondata.com to stop posting if values because they weren ’ t using current if data , suggesting that the ratings found at the official site are based on the most current data available . i think that most evidence shows that wheat is inflammatory , even whole forms . and if that ’ s the case , feeding someone wheat while trying to prove an inflammatory response from saturated fat makes no sense at all ( unless the goal is to implicate saturated fat , and a set-up is being orchestrated ) .the study posted below this ( or maybe above depending on how you order the list ) by allen [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-leaky-gut-theory-of-why-animal-products-cause-inflammation / # comment-1042406846 ] found no difference at all in vascular function when saturated fat is replaced with monounsaturated fat or carbohydrate . i realize this video was posted before the study was published , but it would be great to see doc greger address it . he ’ s been called out for claiming to share all of the evidence while seeming to ignoring and / or refusing to acknowledge data that doesn ’ t support the total elimination of animal food . it would go a long way toward proving his critics wrong if he addressed new , contrary evidence when it appearsphaedra : all of the people i know who are eating a whole plant food based diet are focusing their diets on intact grains : wheat berries , quinoa , etc . not lots of breads . toxins explained why this matters , and i was just answering your question about , “ i don ’ t understand how the phytonutrient content changes when the wheat is ground . it still contains the same fiber and phytonutrients . ” toxins explained his * theory * but there doesn ’ t seem to be any evidence that he is correct since the whole kernel form is rated as inflammatory too . i appreciate your point and have considered it . though my original point remains , if wheat flour isn ’ t very nutritious and therefore is inflammatory ( because its phytonutrients are missing according to toxins ) , can you definitively prove that saturated fat is the cause of the inflammation seen in response to feeding a food that gets almost as many calories from the wheat-flour muffin as it does the sausage patty ? why didn ’ t the researchers simply feed the sausage alone ? a skeptical person might ponder whether researchers knew that it wouldn ’ t cause the inflammatory response they needed to vilify the fat.to the best of your knowledge , is there any data on the phyto-nutrient value of grain-based foods after * cooking * , or was all of the data you mentioned collected on the raw ingredients alone ? i can ’ t speak to your experience , but considering most veg experts recommend whole grain breads ( mcdougall , campbell , ornish , esselstyn , fuhrman- { though he ’ s not a fan of many starches } and it appears to be generally accepted as a pbwf ) , it ’ s hard to imagine that ‘ most vegans ’ are choosing cooked whole kernel grains over the more convenient and portable whole-grain sandwich , wrap , bagel , flatbread or cracker . either way , without evidence that the whole grains retain more of their phyto-nutrients than milled grains do after cooking , it ’ s all just speculation.phaedra : there is one more bit i wanted to correct . you wrote , “ he ’ s been called out for claiming to share all of the evidence … ” to the best of my knowledge , dr. greger has never claimed to share all of the evidence . instead , dr. greger says that he researches all of the evidence so that “ we don ’ t have to . ” dr. greger makes it clear that he is sharing what he considers to be the best science , not all of the science . in other words , dr. greger looks at it all , and then shares just the relevant bits with us on this site – or at least as much of the relevant bits as he has time and money for.you can find a study to prove / say whatever you want . it isn ’ t in the scope of this site to comment on every study , especially studies that dr. greger does not think are relevant or fit the body of evidence . nor would i consider such a scope desirable . if you are looking for a site where the expert who runs it takes the time and “ air space ” to review all competing ideas and studies on a nutrition topic , giving an analysis of why certain studies fit the body of evidence and others do not , i ’ m sure you can find another site which does so . this site has a very clearly defined scope and focus that seems to work for a very large number of people.of course , if you want to continue to get the great information that you can from this site and also post your own studies in order to get some dialog going , that is perfectly fine . maybe someone will take you up on it.good luck.do we have an explanation for the inuit diet ?

sorry i dont really understand english so i sometimes find it difficult to understand some stuff but on this video time 2 : 10. i want to know if orange juice also contribute to inflammation because i can see it among the list. someone help me if i misunderstand it.i know it ’ s an older video but as you ’ re talking about inflammation and the gut , i ’ d like to ask something . i ’ m a nutritional therapy student in uk and it seems that at the moment all the fuss is about bone broths ( as gut healing , nourishing , nutrient dense foods ) . as a vegan , i can ’ t imagine myself ever recommending such a thing to clients … dr. greger , what ’ s your opinion on them or have you seen any research ? i only found one study about higher lead levels in them but not much more . i ’ d appreciate the answer ! dear dr greger : i am slowly going into vegan diet but how do i go about getting the amount of protein that is supposedly found in meat . i can totally switch to no meat diet today but how / what do i base my foods to get the protein / iron in me ? i recently lost my dog … best friend of 12 yrs to hemangiosarcoma cancer , not that this would do much for the talks on the human side of things … .but i did so much research to help him after he had his spleen removed due to it ruptured . i had him on a 80 % raw veggie 20 % cooked white chicken breast and he was doing okay . but then my vet said that i was doing my dog wrong cause his rbc was very low and that he needed iron .. so i switched it and i think it was the main cause why my dog ’ s tumors kept growing . so i have to use this as a good example that a raw veggie diet is a good thing … .meat is bad . but the reason for the change is that i was trusting my vet … that my dog needed for his rbc to go up and that meant i needed to give my dog meat . so for me … .how do i maintain my iron if i was to leave the meat out my diet ? i don ’ t eat much of it but maybe a few times a week it would be the grass feed beef or organic chicken . is there such thing … .. organic meat ? really ? so i was trying to use my dog ’ s experience as that the vet told me to do red meat … but when one ’ s spleen is gone … .doesn ’ t the rbc remain very low anyway ? can a dog live without meat ? cause i keep seeing that a raw meat diet is good for dog ’ s with cancer … .. ugggghhhhso would it be safer for me to go the raw meat diet instead of cooked beef to get my iron ? uggghhhh i just want to be able to prove that going all vegan is possible to get all the nutrients / vitamins needed to be in good health ? i feel that my best friend of 12 yrs , my dog is teaching me a lesson that feeding him the cooked beef did nothing but worsen his cancer metastasis … .. cause when he had his spleen removed back in aug 2014 , i took him off his dry foods of 12 yrs to my 80 % raw greens blended up in baby food texture cause i knew his system was not going to be able to break it down … .and 20 % cooked chicken breast only … .fm aug- 2014 to dec 2014 he was really healthy … .very low inflammatory … but for some reason in later part of dec his numbers jumped fm like 20 to 300 inflammatory … .. so i really dont know what happened there.that is when my vet said i needed to change his diet to cooked beef / livers for iron intake ! ! ! ! so i want to learn by this and do what is right for me … .. can i get the right proteins / iron without meat intake ? what can i eat in place of meat that will give me all that is needed ? how about this whole idea of pro oxidant to fight against cancer ? ? ? ? ? there was a dr dressler ( cancer vet ) and some other readings where it said that doing pro oxidant to fight the existing cancer … .. it causes the free radicals to get even more out of control in the cell where it will kill itself ? but don ’ t do pro oxidant to keep cancer away … but if you have cancer to do pro oxidant ? ? ? ? can you give me your insights on this as well ? these are subjects that i know many folks are wondering about and i know it will help me in my own decision as well . i have a uterine tumor that i found out about 9 yrs ago … .and still have it . is there any diet that will shrink it ? as you talk about tumors … .wonder if any diet would strict the blood flow to my 12cm tumor will help it shrink ? thank you much and i suppose i could have broken out these questions but figure get it all out on table and hope to hear from you dr. greger as i trust your site and love your information you have on your site.with much appreciationmailinmailin : your post spoke to me on several levels , one of which is your comments about your dog . i can relate . my dog is my best friend too . note : i started feeding a vegan kibble to my old dog about 5 years ago . that switch cleared up a serious medical problem and now my dog is outliving the averages for his breed.i thought i would address some of your concerns and then if you liked my responses and wanted more info , i would try to address other concerns . one of your questions is , “ how do i go about getting the amount of protein that is supposedly found in meat . ” the question is about getting * enough * protein . i strongly recommend that you carefully review the information in the following link . it will help you feel a lot more comfortable about the amount of protein you need and how to get it : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmldr. greger has a bunch of videos on iron that i feel do a very good job of starting to address your iron questions : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ?

PLAIN-2949	zero tolerance to acceptable risk according to the latest published national retail meat report , more than 80 % of retail chicken breasts sold in the united states are contaminated with fecal matter . up from about 70 % seven years before . 80 % fecal contamination and that ’ s completely legal , but there are some bugs for which there is zero tolerance . that does not make the meat industry happy ; as the president of the seafood importers and processors association wrote in their article “ beyond zero tolerance : a new approach to food safety , ” they propose a “ risk-based approach instead of a precautionary approach ” from a recent article about raw poultry , instead of zero tolerance , alternative terminology should be used such as acceptable or tolerable risk . instead of zero tolerance policy on potentially deadly bacteria on chicken , they propose alop , an “ appropriate level of protection , " an acceptable risk , a certain number of cases per 100,000 population per year associated with a specific hazard in a particular food commodity . “ given the nature of the poultry industry , controls that are currently applied will not guarantee the absence of salmonella from raw poultry . ” therefore , “ using terms such as ‘ ‘ zero tolerance ’ ’ or ‘ ‘ absence of a microbe ’ ’ in relation to raw poultry should therefore be avoided . ” unfortunately there ’ s no zero tolerance policy on meat for our nation ’ s leading foodborne killer , salmonella — see fecal bacteria survey . for more surveys on how much of the american meat supply is contaminated with fecal matter and foodborne pathogens , see fecal contamination of sushi , fecal residues on chicken , chicken out of utis , u.s. meat supply flying at half staph , and mrsa in u.s. retail meat . salmonella-infected eggs also sicken more than 100,000 americans every year , see total recall . the industry , however , continues to blame the victim . see unsafe at any feed . there are still more than a thousand other topics pertaining to diet and disease.regarding meat and poultry : we have a product , that has to be handled with caution , there is risk of acute intolerence ( poisoning ) , there are severe cronic sideeffects ( cancer , stroke , cardiocascular disease , diabetes ) – hence i recommend that this product becomes a prescription drug ( product ) . you have to be fully informed of the dangers and the benefits ( none ) before you consume it . : - ) and you will now have to go to your family physician to get a prescription for the meat of your choice ! now their talkin ’ ! and would you – my friend – recommend such a dangerous drug for any patient ?

PLAIN-2959	dietary supplement snake oil an editorial was recently published decrying much of the $ 18 billion marketing of dietary supplements in north america as misleading , deceptive — even predatory . after examining hundreds of sales claims made when supplements are being marketed over the years the author concluded “ dishonesty or wild exaggerations are frequent occurrences in the marketing of supplements . ” my favorite quote was “ the marketers of supplements like to use scientific evidence the way a drunk uses a lamp-post : more for support than illumination . ” this is nothing new . similar editorials have been published in the journal of the ama and the new england journal of medicine . what made this special was that is was , to their credit , published in the journal of alternative and complementary medicine . in response the “ head of global supplement initiatives at novis , which actually started out as the livestock feed additives division of monsanto before branching off into human feed additives — dietary supplements , starts his rebuttal with this counterpoint : “ in his review entitled ‘ ‘ the marketing of dietary supplements in north america : the emperor is ( almost ) naked , ’ ’ the author may be mortified to know the emperor is still dancing in the street , dressed or not , to the tune of $ 68 billion . this figure is much higher and is a more relevant number than cited , indicating a very strong and respectable commerce . ” that ’ s his first argument ? that it ’ s highly lucrative ? he goes onto say that hey , they ’ re safer than some pharmaceuticals , but how much is that saying , given that prescription drugs kill an estimated 106,000 americans every year . and that ’ s not errors , not abuse , not overdose that ’ s just deaths from side-effects , adrs , adverse drug reactions , which would make doctors — me and my fellow colleagues — the fourth leading cause of death in the united states . so for the supplement industry to say , " hey , at least we 're not the fourth leading cause of death , " isn 't saying much . the best way to avoid adverse drug reactions is to stay healthy enough to avoid drugs altogether . see ornish ’ s editorial convergence of evidence and say no to drugs by saying yes to more plants . there are also a number of natural remedies that may work as well but have fewer side-effects such as saffron for alzheimer ’ s , flax seeds for prostate enlargement , and amla for diabetes . plants are powerful – check out power plants and videos on all the other 1,000 + topics ! wow ! it ’ s always amazing to me how financial interests corrupt and supersede good , solid scientific evidence . everyday i get someone in the office asking if they should take some supplement they saw advertized online or in a magazine . it ’ s abhorent what the industry has become . and recently i have been getting more and more people coming in taking all kinds of porcine and bovine glandular supplements . i worry that like other animal proteins these will get into the blood and cause an immune response eventually leading to an autoimmune disease . i even have a problem with armour thyroid for the same reason . not to mention from where they get the pig parts . i would love to see a review on that issue.bottom line : ask your vegan / plant strong doctor.next bottom line : prevent disease ( eat plants , avoid animals – except if your want a pet ) .next , next bottom line : a better term for “ health care system ” is “ disease care system ” .correct on all 3 counts dr. juhl ! ! ! bottom ’ s up ! thanks dr dynamic ! and keep up your good work with plantstrong advice to your patients.i will now go eat my carrot ! : - ) if only it were easier to find reputable plant-strong doctors ( covered by health insurance ) . wow , three doctors on the same page , promoting a plant-based diet . today , the sun shines at night.are e cigarettes safe ? is raw protein ( sprouted brown rice protein ) safe ? i would say that supplements have the same dubiety as many pharmaceuticals and personally , i would rather take something my herbalist has recommended than something that is made , funded and marketed by billion dollar corporations that have a very poor track record . i worked at a health food store and witnessed many people have wonderful recoveries or an improvement in their health from utilizing alternative plant-based medicines . of course , there was a lot of poor marketing and false claims , but i still wouldn ’ t discount all supplements as they can have a place in our well being.could you be more specific about the hypertensive supplements ? which ones are good ? i take hawthorn and fish peptides.is dr greger pulling his recommendation to take algae-based omega-3 ? i ’ m confused.nutritionfacts.org , and dr. greger : there is popular a dietary supplement being promoted heavily over facebook called le-vel thrive . i have high concern and skepticism about le-vel thrive . being a dietary supplement – it is not regulated by any agency such as the fda – to my knowledge . to my knowledge – there are no scientific reports or studies about its safety and efficacy . just hundreds ( maybe thousands ) of personal testimonies . most ( if not all ) of the testimonies are provided by people whom are also promoting it – thus making money from it . users claim that they get a pleasant instant buzz from it – probably due to the synephrine , guarana , green coffee beans , phenethelymine , etc. in its ingredients.there are a number of nutritional supplements that fly across our personal radar and promise magical effects daily . they pretend to be “ magic bullets ” that if taken will immediately improve our health . unfortunately little if anything is known about short term and long term health effects.i was wondering if you might be able to conduct some research about this dietary supplement . i have been contacting medical experts and professionals to gather information and impressions.any feedback you might share with me would be appreciated.best wishes , fred l. petersonwell i ’ ve been offered a free package of “ supplements ” from the supplement people . i bought some b12 from them . now they want me to get another supp , on the house . what ? i just looked and they don ’ t have amla , so i don ’ t think they have anything else to offer me . they have everything else-it ’ s crazy what all they do have ( powdered green coffee beans ? ! ) .if the b12 wasn ’ t a 300-year supply , i ’ d get another package of that . am i overlooking something ? or am i right in thinking that wfpb eaters in good apparent health only need to supplement with b12.oh. wow. what is that for ? i take the [ url = http : / / www.best-dietary-supplements.com / ] supplement [ / url ] every week. and it is amazing to see those oils in the container . i guess the oil is more powerful than some medicine. alternative medicine , ama , complementary medicine , industry influence , mortality , side effects , snake oil , supplements supplement industry representative attempts to rebut a mea culpa editorial in an alternative medicine journal decrying the predatory nature of dietary supplement marketing . the best way to avoid adverse drug reactions is to stay healthy enough to avoid drugs altogether . see ornish 's editorial convergence of evidence and say no to drugs by saying yes to more plants . there are also a number of natural remedies that may work as well but have fewer side-effects such as saffron for alzheimer 's , flax seeds for prostate enlargement , and amla for diabetes . plants are powerful--check out power plants and videos on all the other 1,000 + topics !
PLAIN-2969	sad states : standard american diet state-by-state comparison the standard american diet is in a sad state , but sadder in some states than others . the cdc recently released a survey to chart our progress on fruit and vegetable consumption , and , if you can even imagine , we ’ re eating even fewer fruits and vegetables than we were a decade ago . not a single state met the goals they were hoping for , but one , and only one , state did make an improvement . can you guess which one ? here ’ s all 50 . note the deepest darkest color represents 35 % -44.9 % . so not a single state even hit 50 % for eating 2 fruit a day , with oklahoma bombing the worse . and for vegetables ? not one state even had a third of their population for three daily servings of vegetables . and less than 1 in 5 people in south dakota . the cdc goal was to get all states up to 75 % eating servings of fruit and 50 % veggies by 2010 . not even close . and those eating both ? forget about it . , though i am impressed … with new engalnders and their fruit causasians ate the least fruit … . hispanics the least vegetables . and the one state the only state to improve over the decade ? idaho , which just made it to blue . how s.a.d. is the standard american diet ? check out nation ’ s diet in crisis and calculate your healthy eating score . even small tweaks can dramatically boost the antioxidant power of one ’ s meals . see antioxidants in a pinch and a better breakfast . there are dozens more videos on fruits and vegetables and hundreds of videos on more than a thousand other topics . note in the sources cited section that all of the papers are available “ open access , ” which means freely available to the public at no cost.i can ’ t tell you just how sad i feel everyday at the office . but my patients are changing for the better . with good information and great resources like nutritionfacts.org and nutritionmd.org , patients are finally having the daily support and education they need in continuing their lifestyle change and watching their chronic diseases stop , reverse and even disappear ! ! so maybe i don ’ t need counseling for my sad feelings yet ; - } . i ’ ll keep using plants as my therapy and , of course , nutritionfacts.org. just what the doctor ordered ! : ) what to do ? maybe start nutrition classes in elementary school … ? but then if parent or parents don ’ t know about it , poor little child still has no recourse and is at the mercy of what parent provides for food . very sad , indeed ! interestingly , looking at the study , women are doing 8-9 % better than men in getting both fruits and vegetables , and it seems the farther people have pursued formal education , the more likely they are to eat more vegetables.i have also heard that women live longer . related ? i wonder if the whole women thing could be generalized to “ people who cook eat more vegetables than people who don ’ t cook . ” i am md living in denmark and i am very interested in the relationship between disease and diet . i think science speaks loud and clear and md ' s like michael greger is doing a wonderfull job trying to bring out the message . but a lot of people just don 't get it . i have close relatives who are intelligent people ; despite hypertension , diabetes , bypass surgery , high cholesterol , atrial flutter , obesity etc they keep eating butter , cheese , meat , oils , eggs and expect a pill to cure a disease . i have spent hours telling them about diet and disease , but they dont get it . they think i am a fanatic . after last visit they grabbed a burger on the way home . we have a long way … . have them watch “ forks over knives ” ( is it in danish ? ) that will give them a basic level of knowledge , make them think , and will eliminate you from being “ the fanatic ” with crazy ideas . the trick is to give the documentary to their friends , then have them give it to your relatives . good luck ! i have the dvd fok ( it is great ) . maby it will work – thanks for the advicethey say if you want to live the american dream move to denmark . simple solution – instead of subsidizing animal foods & corn syrups we should tax these unhealthy foods so a bag of chips cost $ 15 and turn the taxes towards subsidizing healthy foods so a bell pepper costs $ 0.10 … if a hamburger cost $ 25 or $ 30 people would eat a lot less of them and they ’ d eat a lot more fruit & veggies if they were super cheap . this would be a very effective health care plan ( but the people would protest and anti-government hatred would grow out of control , unfortunately … ) price regulates behavior , so the idea is not all bad . a little less extreme and it would have an effect without “ riots ” . when my 6 years old son watches a commercial with a burger he says “ yummy ! ” – banning commercials with unhealthy food ? too extreme ? having your chest opened and your heart exposed and stopped ( by-pass surgery ! ) leaving you with risk of minor brain-damage is extreme ! can ’ t win against capitalism . they want most people to eat shit so that is the way it is gonna be .. unless you have an education in it – hopefully more people look at this web site . or have the energy to even think about thier diet at all. capitalism works you to the brink sometiems they gotta eat what is easy … i don ; t blame them . i blame the system.you would have been happier in the former ussr . no capitalism but lots of food lines unless you were a higher up party boss , which i am sure you could have been . the people didnt have the luxury to worry about how many fruits or veggies-they just hoped for a full belly . cdc , ethnicity , fruit , idaho , oklahoma , south dakota , standard american diet , vegetables the standard american diet is worsening and falls far from the cdc goals for minimal fruit and vegetable intake , with some states doing worse than others . -
PLAIN-2979	cow ’ s milk casomorphin and crib death this report on cows ' milk induced infant apnea , thought due to the opiate-like effects of bovine casomorphin in milk , was just a single case report . it was so provocative , though , researchers immediately started testing other kids . sids , sudden infant death syndrome , also known as crib death , is the leading cause of death for healthy infants after one month of age . 1 in every 2000 american babies die this way . every day 6 babies stop crying and 6 parents start most susceptible , are infants exposed to several postnatal factors , sleeping on their stomach , second-hand smoke , and high sleep room temperatures , but it is supposed that in some cases of sids , it is cows ’ milk that may play a certain role . it is also suspected that b-casomorphins hold a direct responsibility for that situation . beta casomorphins are biologically active with , as its name suggests , effects similar to that of morphine . penetration of b-casomorphins into the infant ’ s immature central nervous system may inhibit the respiratory centre in the brainstem leading to abnormal ventilatory responses , hypercapnia , which means too much carbon dioxide , hypoxia — not enough oxygen , apnoea , and death . so what they did was study infants who had recurrent life-threatening episodes — meaning apnea , where they stop breathing , or turn blue , or become limp , etc . these are the kinds of events that place babies at high risk for sids . the blood levels of bovine casomorphin in the babies with acute life threatening events averaged three times higher than healthy babies . why ? well , there ’ s an enzyme that gets rid of caso-morphin , and the activity of that enzyme in the affected group was only half that of the healthy kids . and so some babies may just not be able to clear it out of their systems fast enough and are placed at risk for death . for an introduction to bovine casomorphin , see yesterday ’ s video . tomorrow i ’ ll conclude this 3-part video series on the so-called “ milk-apnea effect , ” with a discussion of the role this morphine-like compound may play in other conditions , including autism . casomorphins are also mentioned in my is milk and mucus a myth ? video . and as always there are also hundreds of other videos on more than a thousand subjects.i want to know when this is going to hit national news ! ! i would love to see what the dairy council would say . or will they just ignore it like all the other overwhelming negative research about their contaminated and infected , pus-filled products.it sounds like this is not just direct exposure from dairy formula but the mother drinking / eating dairy and transferring the casomorphin to their child and putting them at risk . 2nd hand dairy . scary stuff.i can ’ t wrap my head around this . there ’ s casomorphine in human milk as well , so i don ’ t see the connection to bovine milk . is it so simple that the mother consume so much casomorphine that the amount is too much for kids to handle ? see the next video . it distinguishes human casomorphins from bovine casomorphins . the bovine casomorphins are linked to autism whereas the human casomorphins are not.does this apply to infants fed a diary-based formula ? is there any effect suspected on breast-fed infants whose mother is consuming dairy it would apply to dairy based formula ’ s as well . breast milk is best for newborns as far as antioxidants see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods / and less exposure to industrial pollutants although since they are fat soluble even infants fed on breast milk get some if their mothers are exposed see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / industrial-pollutants-in-vegans / . i think given all studies on dairy … dr. greger has 58 video ’ s relating to dairy and i ’ m sure there will be more … i would advise all women to avoid dairy during pregnancy , while breast feeding and thereafter.also be sure to check out my associated blog post cow ’ s milk casomorphin , crib death , and autism ! what about the mmr vaccine ?

PLAIN-2990	watermelon as treatment for erectile dysfunction as noted in a recent article in the harvard health letter , up to three ­ quarters of men with cholesterol ­ narrowed coronary arteries have some degree of erectile dysfunction . there 's drugs like viagra , but they 're temporary — and expensive — solution that can cause hazardous side effects . obviously if your arterial system is that damaged a more intensive effort that involves much more than popping a pill can yield longer ­ term improvements in both sexual function and cardiovascular health . plant-based diets can not only reverse both conditions , but one plant in particular may be able to play a stop-gap role in the meantime . the way drugs like viagra work is by inhibiting an enzyme that inactivates something called cgmp , which would otherwise dilates penile blood vessels . so , enzyme inhibition , means more cgmp , which means more blood flow . but there ’ s another way to boost cgmp levels , by going to the other side of the equation and stimulating the enzyme that makes it . that ’ s what nitric oxide does , nitric oxide is made from arginine , arginine can be produced by citrulline , so i wonder what would happen if you ate more citrulline . oral citrulline supplementation improves erection hardness in men with mild erectile dysfunction . and where is citrulline found ? watermelon . how much watermelon would you have to eat every day to match the dose they used in the study ? three and a half servings a day — unless you eat yellow water melon , which has about 4 times as much citrulline , so just a serving a day , one wedge , one sixteeth of a modest melon should work as good as the supplement they used , allowing for a 68 % increase in monthly intercourse frequency which your heart should be able to handle given how much lower your bood pressure will be with watermelon supplementation . watermelon 's … got it all . just as indian gooseberries may help treat diabetes ( see amla versus diabetes ) , but it ’ s better to reverse the disease ( how to treat diabetes ) , watermelon may help treat the symptoms of pelvic atherosclerosis , but it ’ s better to get to the root of the problem and clear out the arterial plaque . see our number one killer can be stopped and the 10 other videos on reversing chronic disease . for more on diet and sexual dysfunction , see cholesterol and female sexual dysfunction , atkins diet : trouble keeping it up and rosy glow . there are also hundreds of other videos on more than a thousand subjects.from my practice in redding ca today there is going to be a mad dash to the store for watermelon ! and in a week there will be a shortage in the local area ! ! another reason to love watermelon … are there any studies you have found on hair loss and diet , especially male pattern baldness ?

some men have problems keeping erections at the beginning of a relationship . then , after they become more comfortable with their new partners , their erections become more reliable . pay attention to your erection patterns to help you decide if you need to see a urologist or a sex therapist . if you have erections when you wake up or through masturbation , but not with a partner , that ’ s important information that says your body is working correctly , physically . for the time being , why not receive pleasure and not worry about erections ? these kinds of difficulties are common and transient . you can view them as part of life rather than as problems . or , if it is a problem for you , sex therapy may make a difference you could be experiencing “ desensitization ” from your masturbation , or “ performance anxiety ” due to your lack of actual experience with a partner.to overcome either of these the most effective “ technique ” is for you and your partner to : 1 . go into your bedroom and get as comfortable as possible . you both need to be very relaxed ( not via alcohol , or drugs ) . try soft lights , soft music . remove your clothing and continue to relax together.2. slowly begin to lovingly touch each other with no goal to engage in sex . as your level of excitement rises relax and enjoy the feelings . again you are not going to have sex ( tonight ) , only pleasure.3. if you feel yourself nearing “ the point of no return ” back off , and / or have your wife apply the semans procedure , aka “ squeeze ” , “ pinch ” procedure . a firm ( not painful ) “ pinch ” to the head of your penis . then when you are able continue “ pleasuring ” each other . this will allow you to experience having erections for longer and longer periods.for lots more information you can go here for some context , please also check out my associated blog post watermelon for erectile dysfunction ! dr.greger , i have read that citryline is found in the rind of watermelon and not watermelon . is this true ? dear doc if citruline is in watermelon that boost the no. to improve ed what about buying citruline at your local health food store .

PLAIN-3000	chicken dioxins , viruses , or antibiotics ? why was there so much more lymphoma and leukemia risk among those eating just a small serving of chicken a day ? the reasons are unclear . certainly there are industrial carcinogens like dioxins that may increase risk of non-hodgkin ’ s lymphoma and have been found in meat and dairy , but the study did not observe an increased risk in association with high milk consumption , and so that ’ s probably not it . secondly , poultry may contain oncogenic , or cancer-causing , viruses , especially if the meat is not cooked well . and it ’ s interest there are actually studies in the u.s. reporting a lower risk of lymphoma in women consuming well-done meat . you ’ d think it ’ s be the other way around because of the heterocyclic amines , the cooked meat carcinogens created when you grill chicken , but not if it ’ s the viruses in chicken that are responsible . oncogenic animal viruses have been suspected as causes of lymphoma among farmers and slaughterhouse workers , but this is just preliminary : meat consumption has not been connected with transmission of oncogenic viruses , yet . and their third theory why poultry was so significantly associated with blood and lymph node cancers , is perhaps because chickens and turkeys are often treated with antiparasitic drugs and antibiotics to enhance growth of the animals and to treat and prevent disease , especially given the conditions many of them are now raised in . and indeed antibiotic use has sometimes been associated with the risk of lymphoma , however it it is unclear whether the association between antibiotic use and cancer risk is cause and effect and , more importantly , whether antibiotic use in food animals can affect cancer risk in human beings . see the “ prequel , ” epic findings on lymphoma , and the one before it on general cancer rates . for more on industrial pollutants in meat , see vegetarians versus healthy omnivores , harvard ’ s meat and mortality studies and prevention is better than cured meat . for more on cancer-causing viruses , see breast cancer survival , butterfat and chicken , meat additives to diminish toxicity and carcinogens in the smell of frying bacon . and for more on drug residues in meat , see drug residues in meat . the mass use of antibiotics in chicken feed may also be contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria ( for example , see u.s. meat supply flying at half staph ) . there are also hundreds of other videos on more than a thousand subjects.love these summaries , dr. greger ! thank you ! also , please check out my associated blog post : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / blog / 2012 / 05 / 17 / poultry-and-penis-cancer / ! please also check out my associated blog post , poultry and penis cancer ! antibiotics , cancer , cancer viruses , carcinogens , chicken , cooking methods , cooking temperature , dioxins , factory farming practices , farm animals , farmers , grilling , heterocyclic amines , industrial toxins , leukemia , lymphoma , meat , persistent organic pollutants , poultry , poultry viruses , poultry workers , turkey , women 's health the association between poultry and cancer may be explained by the presence in chickens ' and turkeys ' flesh of industrial carcinogens such as dioxins , oncogenic ( cancer-causing ) viruses , and / or the drugs that were fed to the birds . see the " prequel , " epic findings on lymphoma , and the one before it on general cancer rates . for more on industrial pollutants in meat , seevegetarians versus healthy omnivores , harvard ’ s meat and mortality studiesand prevention is better than cured meat . for more on cancer-causing viruses , see breast cancer survival , butterfat and chicken , meat additives to diminish toxicity and carcinogens in the smell of frying bacon . and for more on drug residues in meat , see drug residues in meat . the mass use of antibiotics in chicken feed may also be contributing to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria ( for example , see u.s. meat supply flying at half staph ) . there are also hundreds of other videos on more than a thousand subjects .
PLAIN-3013	lung cancer metastases and broccoli what else can broccoli do ? breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the united states but lung is actually the # 1 cancer killer of women . about 85 % of women with breast cancer are still alive 5 years later , but ling cancer is picked up so late that the number ’ s reversed , 85 % of lung cancer victims are dead . and 90 % of those deaths are from metastases , the lung cancer spreading to other parts in the body . well broccoli seems to be able to do everything else , what about suppressing the metastatic potential of human lung cancer cells ? check ! what they did to assess cancer cell migration is laid down a layer of cancer in a petri dish and then cut a swath down the middle . within 24 hours , the cancer was creeping back , and by 30 hours closed the gap completely . until , they start dripping some cruciferous compounds on them . as you can see the cancer cells seem almost paralyzed , stuck in place . they don ’ t seem to want to go anywhere , any time soon . in their conclusion , they talk about the antiproliferative , antitumor activities of these broccoli family dietary compounds , ending with a word rarely seen in scholarly literature , since it ’ s just so nondescript , but in this case they evidently felt it necessary . these compounds have inhibitory effects on several types of cancer cell growth , such as leukemia , prostate cancer , breast cancer , lung cancer , cervical cancer , colorectal cancer , et . , cetera . this video is the tenth in a series on the latest research on cruciferous vegetables . there were two on kale , kale and the immune system and smoking versus kale juice . one on dna protection ( dna protection from broccoli ) , two on breast cancer ( broccoli versus breast cancer stem cells and sulforaphane : from broccoli to breast ) , two on upper safety limits ( liver toxicity due to broccoli juice and how much broccoli is too much ?

i would stay away from isolated phytochemical nutrient or antioxidant supplements . the experience with beta carotene and carotenoids should tell us that we should be getting our nutrients from whole foods . see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / antioxidant-vitamin-supplements / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / produce-not-pills-to-increase-physical-attractiveness / as dr.greger concludes … produce not pills.i hope be friend of you i study in since collage depart biochemistry and nutritionfor some context , please also check out my associated blog post breast cancer stem cells vs. broccoli ! don ’ t mean to be the cynic about anti-cancer foods , but afaik none helped steve jobs or lance armstrong.when you liquify broccoli and other green leafy in a high speed blender do you lose some of the fiber ?

PLAIN-3025	so should we drink beet juice or not ? why don ’ t those carcinogenic nitrosamines form in our stomachs from all the nitrites coming off our tongue ? because , our body ’ s not stupid and actively secretes vitamin c into our stomach juices to prevent that kind of thing from happening.that makes sense , right ? why would our body go out its way to evolve this elaborate double pass mechanism to produce lots of nitrite if it was harmful . as one group of researchers noted , if nitrite were , indeed , [ itself ] a carcinogen , we would be advised to avoid swallowing because saliva contains so much … .so the way we are able to safely produce nitric acid from nitrites is by smuggling it into our bodies in safe nitrate plant form . plants come prepackaged with just what the body needs to keep their nitrates from becoming carcinogenicthe bottom line is that whopping doses of nitrates , from vegetables , is likely to improve athletic performance and blood pressure without increasing cancer risk as long as it ’ s done in the context of a healthy plant-based diet . as long as there ’ s fat-free phytonutrients physically in your stomach for three or four hours after we nitrate load , the nitrites produced will zip through our system and feed our muscles and vessels with nitric oxide . and it doesn ’ t take much — like 20 mg of vitamin c is all you need in your stomach to block nitrosamine production . that ’ s like 2 stawberries , a little stalk of broccoli , or slice of bell pepper . our bodies may have evolved getting about 600 a day ! if you ’ re out cycling green tea would probably be the most convenient.there isn ’ t any vitamin c in beet juice , though , so just sipping beet juice all day is probably not the best route , though there might be other phytonutrients in it that will serve the purpose . that ’ s something we still don ’ t know . but a big arugula salad has as much nitrate as a cup of beet juice , and in addition , the requisite dose of vitamin c. whole foods are always preferable , but if you do decide to juice your own you beets you should add some greens or something so throughout the day you can maximize nitric acid production while minimizing any risk . and finally , the finale . it all started with doping with beet juice . then an exploration of the mechanism in priming the proton pump and don ’ t use antiseptic mouthwash . the real-world confirmation in out of the lab and onto the track . then off on an interesting tangent in asparagus pee and pretty in pee-nk . the heart-healthy benefits of vegetable nitrates in hearts shouldn ’ t skip a beet and then where to find the most in vegetables rate by nitrate . then a seven-video journal to explain is bacon good or is spinach bad ? before landing us here . i hope you enjoyed the ride . please let me know if you have any questions and make sure to check out my hundreds of other videos.i was surprised to see you reference a paper by eaton on so called “ paleolithic nutrition . ” these folks are part of a group who argues that we ( humans ) need to eat lots of meat to be healthy because that is built into our genes … .. despite the overwhelming evidence that eating less ( or no ) meat promotes better health and that there are no nutrients except b12 not effectively obtained from a plant based diet.david jenkins is more convincing in arguing our genetic heritage is more likely rooted in the miocene , with a diversity of plant foods at the root of our diet.the garden of eden : plant-based diets , the genetic drive to store fat and conserve cholesterol , and implications for epidemiology in the 21st century jenkins , david j. a. * † ‡ ; kendall , cyril w. c. * ‡ epidemiology : march 2006 – volume 17 – issue 2 – pp 128-130i have tremendous respect for dr. jenkins and his “ ape diet ” ( also known as the portfolio diet ) that i refer to in low fat or whole food . he was the guy who came up with the glycemic index concept . he was a co-author of the seminal review i covered in egg cholesterol in the diet and my zombie-themed avoiding cholesterol is a no-brainer . he ’ s also the one behind the plant-based “ eco-atkins ” diet ( plant-based atkins diet ) . the full text of the commentary you mention is available at the garden of eden : plant-based diets.so previous videos led me to believe that drinking beet juice was good for me , especially helping my blood pressure . this video leads me to think otherwise . am i missing the point here ? any clarification is welcomed . thanks.david : i ’ m sure someone else will have a better answer for you , but i thought i would give you some feedback.i do not believe that this video says that drinking beet juice is bad for you . this video seems to only say that beet juice * by itself * may not be as beneficial as it could be because it may not have the requisite vitamin c or similar nutrient . and since whole foods are almost always better than not , you might as well have your arugula salad and get more from your food than you would with just the beet juice.that ’ s how i interpreted the video . if you go back and watch the video again , i would be interested to hear if you still think this video is saying that eating beet juice is necessarily bad.or possibly beet juice with lemon or orange juice added ? thea is correct , beet juice is just fine . but if we add vitamin c it will be more effective.i ’ ve read that beet juice taken every day could cause the body to have a allergic effect so it would be best to limit this to a few times a week.hey doc : love your website – thank you for all your efforts to promote good health . as an endurance athlete i thought that beets / beet juice was my little secret but now you ’ ve let the cat out of the bag so to speak . i am curious if you had any comments on dr. ferenczi ’ s early hungarian studies on the use of beets / beet juice to combat cancer ? ? best regards , davei see dr. ferenczi has published papers in both hungarian and german . anyone out there willing and able to translate them for me if i send you the pdfs ? for an overview of my beet videos , see my blog yesterday at one green planet : using greens to improve athletic performance.did you get this translated ? i am sure i can get the german translated by a friend.what are the best foods to fight colon cancer with advanced mets ? dear dr. greger , thank you for all the wonderful information . could you please summarize how much broccoli is optimal for breast cancer prevention and how it should be prepared and onsumed ? more advice about this topic is greatly apreciated ! many thanks.check out this video ! http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / broccoli-versus-breast-cancer-stem-cells / just about every friend of mine is taking an l-arginine supplement by the bucketful . they ’ ve been told by the direct marketer who sells it to them that l-arginine is a precursor to nitric oxide so it ’ s a vasodilator . “ studies show ” , they ’ ve been told , that l-arginine dissolves arteriosclerotic plaque , and that it lowers cholesterol . thus , my friends think they are protected from heart disease and strokes.i am skeptical . is there any truth to these health claims ? it is true , arginine is used to create nitric oxide , but i don ’ t know the effects of supplementing this , since it is already a nutrient our body creates . i am curious to see the studies that are purported by your friends to see if supplementing arginine really does increase nitric oxide . i have heard dr. caldwell essylsten say we shouldn ’ t supplement arginine but he didnt delve into detail as to why.as i wrote , ” ‘ studies show ’ , they  ve been told … ” is the most i ’ ve gotten from them . they ’ ve been told these claims by the salesman , who evidently is a friend or a trusted chiropractor . they ’ ve all made some dietary changes , but any improvements in lipid markers , blood pressure , and other improvements they attribute to the arginine . they wouldn ’ t know a real study if they tripped over it.same goes for the virgin coconut oil they use as well.ps. i wouldn ’ t be surprised if dr. oz was their source for what they “ know ” about l-arginine . they pretty much consider anything he says to be gospel truth.could you please comment on whether these beet juice effects are best seen in aerobic type sports vs anaerobic type sports such as weight lifting , short distance swim and track eventsat a point in the video it state “ fat free nitrate ” does that mean if you use a fat based dressing ie olive oil on the roquette salad that the effects are attenuated or even negative ( as with bacon ) ? cheers , mel we should avoid olive oil for health reasons but that is another discussion entirely.nitrates are found in the plant , and your body must convert it to nitrites . when it is in the form of nitrites , only then will fat turn it carcinogenic . otherwise , nitrates alone will not become carcinogenic.toxins , when you say that ” … .. the body must convert it to nitrites , only then will fat turn it carcinogenic ” does this imply that if i combine arugula or spinach ( full of ni . ) with fat , such as macadamia nuts or pecans , the fat in the nuts will turn it carcinogenic ? thank you . the answer is no , because spinach and arugula contains nitrates not nitrites . if you eat it with nuts , the fat will not turn nitrates alone carcinogenic . it must circulate back and be secreted to your salivary glands via the liver . once your mouth flora convert the nitrates to nitrites , if you eat nuts after that point the nitrites will become carcinogenic nitrosamines . do not be afraid to eat nuts with your greens.hi , i had the exact same question as mel and moonchasis and i found your response very helpful.i have one more question , however . in the video , dr. greger says that , “ as long as we have fat-free phytonutrients physically in our stomachs for three or four hours after we nitrate load , ” we should be okay in regards to avoiding the formation of nitrosamines from nitrites . does this statement imply that nitrates are very quickly absorbed , circulated , secreted in our saliva and converted to nitrites to be re-swallowed within a few minutes of eating a lot of nitrate-rich foods ? if this is true , i imagine that eating fat ( such as nuts ) with nitrate-rich foods ( arugula salad ) would induce nitrosamine formation . in this case , the food , fat and phytonutrients ( vitamin c ) all stay in the stomach for a few hours ( during digestion ) and if the nitrates are quickly circulated , then they will arrive in the stomach again as nitrites to react with the fat and vitamin c that have not yet left the stomach ( and subsequently form nitrosamines ) .however , this seems counter-intuitive because as dr. greger indicated in another video , eating fat with greens enhances nutrient absorption.you stated : “ once your mouth flora convert the nitrates to nitrites , if you eat nuts after that point the nitrites will become carcinogenic nitrosamines . ” this seems to suggest that it takes a few hours for the nitrates to circulate into the saliva and that when re-swallowing as nitrites , the fat ( the nuts you ate with the original salad ) will have already left the stomach . what you said and my interpretation of it seem to make more sense to me ( that it takes a few hours for the nitrates to circulate ) , considering that it is recommended to eat fat with greens.otherwise , if the nitrates were circulated immediately , it would seem counter-intuitive to recommend eating fat with nitrate-rich foods in order to enhance absorption of fat-soluble nutrients because at the same time , the fat and vitamin c still in the stomach would facilitate the formation of carcinogens with the immediate addition of re-swallowed nitrite.do you think that dr. greger actually meant what you stated ? also , do you know anything about how long it would take for the nitrate to be circulated ? thanks ! kevinif we eat nuts with salad , the bolus of food in the stomach will be mixed . although it is true that stomach emptying occurs more slowly when fat is present , that does not mean that the salad will be selectively squirted into the duodenum without the nuts . it will come out at the same time.i am not sure how long each process within the nitrate cycle takes but i know the overall affect takes about 3.5 hours . we should note that it is not essential to mix nuts with salad , and we have no evidence that the more that is absorbed the better . in any case , i do not see the nitrate with nuts as a major issue as long as one is following a whole foods plant based diet.i have had a lot of success with lowering my blood pressure by drinking a cup of fresh beet juice per day . recently a friend told me that her doctor cautioned her not to drink more than 1 beet ’ s worth of juice per day because it would damage kidneys and liver . is there any basis to the “ no more than one beet per day ” theory ? thank you , jeanniethe dr. may be suggesting this due to the relatively high oxalate content of beets , although i dont know of any research suggesting that oxalates are unhealthy or should be monitored when eaten in the form of whole plant foods . it may be possible to get alot of oxalates through juicing but i do not have a clear answer for you.thank you so much and thank you for your fabulous website . i am going to keep drinking lots of beet juice ! jeanniehow long should i allow for beets to go out of my system to take a fecal sample for my doctor . i am told that beets can cause a false positive for blood in fecal sample . thanksit takes 18 hours for food to exit a healthy digestive system digestive system.how long should i allow for beets to go out of my system to take a fecal sample for my doctor . i am told that beets can cause a false positive for blood in fecal sample . thanksthank you very much for the great videos ! as an elite endurance cyclist i am very interested the concept of beet juice and vit c. i was wondering if there is any research out there or you have any suggestions as to timing . should i ingest the beet juice + vit c directly before a race , 1 hr before , etc … . does it matter what time of day ? thank you in advance.hello dr , greger , thanks for the very helpful material.i wonder , if beet juice is prepared and contained in a close bottle in a refrigerator , does its qualities fully preserved for 1-2 days ? or is it that in order to gain the maximal benefit , juice needs to be prepared just before one wants to drink it ? similar question please with regard to keeping pilled and cut to slices beet roots in a friege ( if one doesn ’ t want to deal with it on early mornings ) ? thanks again , jaside from the loss of fiber , are there any other detriments to using a masticating juicer , as opposed to eating the whole food ? again , as there is no general category for related questions ( sorry ) : dr. ignarro advises l-argine supplements ( along with citruline ) in order to enhance no production.i know that in general the trending is away from supplementation with the exception of perhaps vit d , b12 and .. & milk thistle.i am wondering if you have any updated information regarding the ( in ) effectiveness / desirability of this supplementation.i might also ask about any risk / benefits of supplementing : alpha-lipoic acid , co-q10 , and milk thistlethank you very much.arginine is a nonessential amino acid that our body can produce enough of to function optimally and properly , this is why it is known as a nonessential amino acid . citruline can be consumed just by eating citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges so i see no need in supplementing these 2 compounds . i know of no evidence claiming that these 2 substances should be consumed in pill form.ala is simply plant based omega 3 which converts to dha and epa in our body . consuming flax seeds , walnuts and other whole plant foods can provide more then enough ala . i am unfamiliar with co-q10 and milk thistle but i can predict that these things are also close to useless . eating whole unprocessed plant foods will provide all the nutrients you need , except vitamin b12 and vitamin d , to achieve optimal health.if plants are grown in deficient soil , then iodine and / or selenium may be needed . though kelp and brazil nuts may be the answer.be cautious with kelp , as with dr. gregers video here . kelp is an extremely concentrated source of iodine.beets contain vitamin chttp : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / vegetables-and-vegetable-products / 2348 / 2not very much though , 11 % in a 136 gram cup is skimpy.hi doc , you mentioned to add greens to beet jiuce … does that inlcude the beet greens ? if so , it makes it easy to get beets along with its greens and juice all of it to make it a simpler solution than adding another green.thanks , rkdr . greger , germany here , great website ! after watching your “ athlete-series ” i would like to know if the time of ingestion of nitrate-rich foods such as arugola is influencing the training-benefits ? for example , is it better to take it directly before training or better 2-3 hours before ? thanks.i ’ ve been drinking beet juice for years so was a little worried when i found out nitrosamines and their carcinogenic properties . have to say i feel less confused after watching this . thanks for the info ! it also seems that of the many nitrosamine compounds that have been identified , not all of them are thought to be carcinogens.any comments on beet greens – what is the best way to eat them – as they have oxylic acid – which is apparantly binds with calcium in the body ?

PLAIN-3036	asparagus pee i just presented evidence from this a groundbreaking new series of experiments suggesting beets can significantly improve athletic performance . can ’ t be that easy , there has to be a downside.well , those who want their kids to get a jump on physical fitness should know that the american academy of pediatrics recommends we shouldn 't feed vegetables to infants less than three months of age , but we shouldn 't be feeding babies anything but breast milk at that age anyway.what else ? beets do have a lot of oxalates in them , and though the primary means of preventing oxalate kidney stone formation involves meat restriction , and eating more fruits and vegetables , some people are genetically predisposed to oxalate absorption , in which case they might want to instead choose a different high nitrate plant food to boost their performance.other than that theoretical concern , only two side effects were consistently noted in these studies : no deleterious side effects , but subjects did , however , report beeturia ( red urine ) and red stools.that ’ s actually the real name , beeturia , the passage of pink or red urine after the ingestion of beetroot , and it doesn ’ t happen in everybody , which is kinda interesting.same thing with asparagus — only about half of the population gets stinky pee from asparagus , whereas the frequency appears greater among americans . those who produce the odor assume , politely , that everyone does and those who do not produce it have no idea of the olfactory consequences of asparagus . there is no reason as to why these two opposing factions should converse on this subject . a brief discourse with one ’ s colleagues will confirm such differences and verify this state of affairs.it actually gets curioser and curioser . there are not just two types of people in the world when it comes to asparagus pee , but four . some people get stinky pee but apparently genetically don ’ t have the ability to smell the smelly compounds themselves : some people are excretors of stinky asparagus pee while others are nonexcretors ; however others are perceivers ( able to smell the odor ) while others can ’ t . so some people think they don ’ t have stinky pee but in actuality it ’ s just not stinky to them.you ’ ve got to love nutritional science . if you missed the beginning of this series , start with the experiments described in doping with beet juice and replicated in yesterday ’ s video . in monday ’ s video-of-the-day , i ’ ll use beeturia to illustrate an important point about phytonutrients and return to the nitric oxide story on tuesday . have a great weekend , and feel free to spend it watching hundreds of my other videos on more than a thousand subjects : ) for the asparagus lovers out there , check out my videos # 1 anticancer vegetable and best cooking method.dr. greger , i ’ m 63 now , and i ’ ve been a vegan for about 40 years . i recently learned that i have kidney stones ; one of them is one centimeter , sitting in my right kidney ( saw it inadvertently in an x-ray ) . ( i wish i knew what to do about it . i ’ m scared of the doctors . should i get them blasted and have cat scans , etc . ) admittedly , i eat a lot of kale along with many fruits and vegetables . not as often , i ’ ll eat some steamed beets , and when i do , i have beetstoolia . and sharing further , in keeping with the humorous aspect of this episode of the series , if i eat a can of vegetarian chili ( i won ’ t name the popular vegetarian brand ) , i have chilistoolia , so much so , that the odor is the same as when i freshly open the can the night before.seriously though , what to do about the stones ? is doing nothing an option ? hi this is the first time i have replied .. dont know how this works … you said “ admittedly i eat a lot of kale ” but that makes me wonder … because the info i find on kale is that it is low oxalate … nothing like spinach or beets. please advisealright , then , i think the most information i ’ m going to get on this thread is for kidney stones , cut down on the beets.thank you.veguyan & dr greger … thanks for this site – i am a nutritionfacts fan , and vegan . yes and i have similar questions not just about beets but about other high oxalate foods and kidney function . i would be interested in a response from the doc in relation to any results from research done in the field of oxalates & the kidneys , intestinal flora and oxalate absorption and low oxalate plant foods that can replace the higher oxalate ones in a vegan diet . it would be so great if the doc could do a series on vegan food substitutions for things like low oxalate vegan diet and also a gluten free diet as i know a number of people who ’ s food sensitivities and ailments have made their food choices already limited but who would love to choose a vegan diet . in these cases would it also be wise to seek the advice of a plant based dietician ? i just read your durian story in one of your q & a and was wondering if there is anything similiar with the smell of durian me and my partner were driving back home after i bought some durian . funny enough i am only able to detect a slight smell while my partner wanted to leave the car and take the bus ! : di recently read or heard that beeturia , etc . , is caused by a shortage of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.this video is completely useless … it is entertaining , and i learned a new word , so not useless . american academy of pediatrics , asparagus , athletes , beet juice , beets , beeturia , breast milk , breastfeeding , children , exercise , fruit , infants , kidney disease , kidney health , kidney stones , meat , nitrate , nutrient absorption , oxalates , sense of smell , side effects , vegetables young infants and perhaps those with recurrent oxalate kidney stones should avoid beets , but most commonly the chief side effect is beeturia , the harmless passage of pink urine , though not all are affected , akin to the malodorous urine ( " stinky pee " ) that sometimes results from asparagus consumption . if you missed the beginning of this series , start with the experiments described in doping with beet juice and replicated in yesterday ’ s video . in monday 's video-of-the-day , i 'll use beeturia to illustrate an important point about phytonutrients and return to the nitric oxide story on tuesday . have a great weekend , and feel free to spend it watching hundreds of my other videos on more than a thousand subjects : ) for the asparagus lovers out there , check out my videos # 1 anticancer vegetable and best cooking method .
PLAIN-304	epa dioxin limit has national chicken council worried products could be declared " unfit for consumption " dioxin , industrial pollutant of agent orange infamy , has been called “ the most toxic compound synthesized by man . ” not only is dioxin considered a known human carcinogen , adverse health effects may include cardiovascular disease , diabetes , endometriosis , early menopause , reduced testosterone and thyroid hormones , altered metabolism and immune responses , and skin , tooth , and nail abnormalities . exposure during pregnancy can result in altered thyroid , brain , immune system , and reproductive organ development . the environmental protection agency start testing americans ’ tissues for dioxin levels back in 1982 , and after 3 decades of delay is releasing new guidelines this month that would set limits on the safe exposure of u.s. consumers to this class of toxic chemicals . in response , the national chicken council , american meat institute , and other industry groups complained to the white house that their products “ could arbitrarily be classified as unfit for consumption . ” but the classification wouldn ’ t be arbitrary at all ; it would be based on the level of dioxin contamination in the food . warning consumers about the risk could “ scare the crap out of people , ” the industry groups contend , and “ have a significant negative economic impact on all u.s. food producers . ” but that ’ s not true either . according to the food and drug administration , “ over 95 % [ of dioxin exposure is ] coming through dietary intake of animal fats . ” the only reason “ nearly every american – particularly young children – could easily exceed the daily rfd [ reference dose exposure limit ] after consuming a single meal ” is because americans currently eat so much meat , eggs , and dairy . consumer food safety champion caroline smith dewaal praised the epa ’ s decision to set a dioxin safety limit but stressed the agency needs to take it a step further : “ having a limit is always a good thing , but consumers will need to know how to translate it into their daily diet . ” eating low on the food chain is the best strategy to reduce one ’ s risk , but does not eliminate exposure ( see industrial pollutants in vegans ) . in my dioxins in the food supply video i run through the latest usda and epa survey data of the level of dioxins and dioxin-like pollutants in the american food supply . pingback : big food says epa ’ s dioxin limits will “ scare the crap out of people ” appetite for profit | appetite for profit ( ) pingback : michele simon : food lobby says epa ’ s dioxin limits will " scare the crap out of people " | screw cable ( ) pingback : michele simon : food lobby says epa ’ s dioxin limits will " scare the crap out of people " | tubeshaker ( ) pingback : live and let dioxin : big ag is worried about scaring us off meat and milk | grist ( ) pingback : food lobby says epa ’ s dioxin limits will “ scare the crap out of people ” | organic connections ( ) so great to see all these mentions . thank you , michele , for linking from your fantastic blog appetite for profit.time for an update ? so what is the current state of the rule on dioxin limits ? dioxin is a manufactured product that our bodies only can eliminate very slowly . the half life is considered to be about 6-7 years but these estimates are based on industrial exposures and may not be accurate for other situations . for me as a clinician and concerned with health i advise all my patients to minimize dioxin intake … the idea that there are limits for non natural substances such as dioxin is not in the best interests for consumers in my opinion.dr. greger . i am wondering about endometriosis . my 21 year old daughter was diagnosed two years ago with stage 2 endometriosis after two years in pain . her presentation wasn ’ t typical ; periods started at 14 and were very irregular ( only a few a year ) , light and no pain . at 17 she started getting pain at all times and severe constipation . diagnosed with pcos at 18 and put on birth control but pain continued . she just went off syneral after 1 year and is not responding to birth control . she has severe headaches and nausesa . she is off linzess after almost two years by eating 2 kiwi a day . are there any food or “ natural treatments ” to stop or slow the endometriosis ? this cocktail of hormones is making her life very difficult and it is scary . she is now eating almost completely plant based diet , other than the occasional college slip up but i am afraid diet alone can ’ t stop this . american meat institute , cardiovascular disease , chicken , diabetes , dioxins , endometriosis , environmental protection agency , epa , fish , fish oil , food and drug administration , international ice cream association , menopause , mercury , metabolism , national cheese institute , national chicken council , pcb , pregnancy , salmon , testosterone , thyroid - -
PLAIN-3052	anti up on the veggies in choosing the healthiest foods , you may notice that everywhere you look , everyone seems to have a different " top ten " list of the most antioxidant-rich foods , with probably dozens of competing commercial products swearing theirs is the " best of the best " . some are probably just making stuff up , but genuine competing estimates arise from people citing old data , [ j. agric . food chem . 2004 , 52 , 4026-4037 , " lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidant capacities of common foods in the united states " ] where they only test a few dozen foods , or a few hundred , but other disparities arise from different labs using different tests.there are four in common usage : orac , teac , trap , and frap . usda likes orac . these researchers [ nutrition journal 2010 , 9 : 3 " the total antioxidant content of more than 3100 foods , beverages , spices , herbs and supplements used worldwide " ] used frap , in part because it 's one of the quickest methods , which is important if you 're doing 3,000 foods . each has their pros and cons , but the problem with all of them is that they 're just measuring how good a particular food is at altering a chemical oxidation reaction in a test tube . it 's not done in a biological system.but for the first time ever , scientists at cornell took 27 vegetables [ j. agric . food chem . 2010 , 58 , 6621-6629 , " cellular antioxidant activity of common vegetables " ] and measured their cellular antioxidant activity : their ability to quench free radicals within cells , by testing various vegetables on cultures of human liver cells . sure , some phytonutrient may be a great antioxidant outside the cell , but what if it can 't get inside the cell ? that 's where we need it ! if you do the standard orac test , this is what you find : spinach at the top , cucumber at the bottom . no surprise ; dark green leafy leads the pack . but again , this is a chemical assay , measuring how these foods slow down some oxidation reaction in a test tube , a reaction that actually doesn 't even occur in nature . but hey , look , it 's the best we had : until now . any guesses as to who was able to unseat spinach ? here 's the cellular antioxidant activity . cucumber is still at the bottom . but now , beating everyone else : beets ! number one , spinach , isn 't even in the top ten any more . all the cruciferous moved ahead : brussels sprouts , broccoli , cabbage , cauliflower . and hey , look , between the beets and the red bell pepper , it looks like the greens got beat out by the reds . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check out all the other videos on antioxidants and don ’ t miss all the videos where we rank foods . and there are 1,449 subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them ! do you know of any research or connections between nutrition & mental illnesses such as obsessive compulsive disorder , anorexia , or other conditions involving the basal ganglia of the brain ? ? i ’ m not aware of studies for those disorders … there are studies suggesting that a plant based diet can help improve mood , depression and anxiety . see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / improving-mood-through-diet / plus consumption of food additives on children see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / are-artificial-colors-bad-for-you / . hopefully more studies will come along showing the benefit of healthy eating on peoples mental well being.avoid gluten . dr. mcdougall has claimed that it can cause mental illness.what are you talking about ? mcdougall has never said anything bad about gluten . in fact , he recommends whole wheat as part of your “ starch-based ” diet , ( unless you have celiac disease like 1 % of people ) . in fact , he ’ s already done a video about how “ gluten-free ” is a distraction from our real dietary problems.so , now what ? should i be putting beets in my smoothie instead of kale ? what about all those other great green leafies , dump them for the new list ? i usually put beets in my green smoothies ( which makes them red ) . i wouldn ’ t throw out the greens , but add in the reds , but i ’ m no doctor.jbwormer , antioxidants are only one aspect of the full nutritional profile of green leafies . there are many nutrients that do not act as antioxidants that are highly benifical to ones health . keep the greens ! this new assay shows that lettuce has more cellular antioxidant value than romaine ? something seems very wrong here ! sorry to see that kale doesn ’ t look to have been included in this study.it could be green leaf lettuce … it doesn ’ t specify iceberg.i suspect the study on cellular antioxidant activity of 25 common fruits will be posted soon . should be another very informative video.wondering how the antioxidant values of spices would place using this new “ real world ” assay method.does this new information have any bearing on cooked vs raw ? i recall that according to the video ‘ best cooking method ‘ ( which by the way is an example of a video with excellent sound , not distorted / too loud / muffled ) , bell peppers should deffo not be cooked.dr. greger : where does swiss chard belong on the scale ? i grow a lot of it and freeze it so that i can eat it all year . i use it the same way spinach is used . i much prefer it to spinach , and it is easier to grow in my climate . does it have similar health benefits as spinach ? this is a very interesting topic . looking fwd to see the codex alimentarius to incorporate this way of measuring a.ox. into their standard practice . well spotted dr greger . cheers. filhi , is it possible to have the complete study ( on cellular antioxydant activity ) with the graphic . it will be very usefull for my work . anne-marie , dietician in montrealje viens de vous l ’ a envoyé anne-marie profitez-en ! hi dr. greger , i would love to get this study on cellular antioxidants , but they ’ re charging for the full text ! the source isn ’ t even cited here , i ’ ve seen it in the # 7 dvd : j agric food chem . 2010 jun 9 ; 58 ( 11 ) : 6621-9 . cellular antioxidant activity of common vegetables . song w , derito cm , liu mk , he x , dong m , liu rh . sourcedepartment of food science , cornell university , ithaca , new york 14853-7201 , usa.thank you so much for all your work ! adalberto m. caccia ( from italy ) can we assume that since beets were so good at penetrating and anti-oxidizing liver cells , that they will do that for all ( or even most ) cells in the body ? or , just like in ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / 1-anticancer-vegetable / ) will vegetables be more or less effective against different cancer cells ? jordan ( boston ) watch your spelling ! “ anti- ” means against , suggesting one should beware of consuming more veggies . you probable mean “ ante-up ” .i meant “ you probably mean … . ” i think he was punning off of “ anti-oxidants . ” is there an update to this study … its 3 years old now ?

PLAIN-3062	amla versus cancer cell growth indian gooseberries , not to be confused with barbados gooseberries , cape gooseberries , chinese gooseberries , otherwise known as kiwi fruit , jamaican gooseberries , tahitian or star gooseberries . the true indian gooseberry , also known as amla , is considered a wonder berry in the treatment and prevention of cancer , according to review published this year in the european journal of cancer prevention.arguably the most important medicinal plant in ayervedic medicine , and also used in traditional chinese and thai medicine , preclinical studies have evidently shown that amla possesses anti-fever properties , anti-pain , anti-cough , anti-artery clogging , anti-stress , heart protective , stomach protective , anti-anemia , anti-cholesterol , wound healing , anti-diarrheal , anti-artery-clogging — didn ’ t they already say that ? as well as protecting the liver , kidneys and nerves . it can also evidently be used for snake venom neutralizer as well , as a hair tonic . it ’ s like the kitchen sink of berry medicine.starting ten years ago , studies started coming out showing that amla extracts kill cancer cells in a petri dish . but lots of things kill cancer cells . you could pee in the test tube and kill cancer cells . what you want is something that kills cancer cells but leaves normal cells alone , and it wasn ’ t until recently that this was demonstrated with alma.they tested amla against six human cancer cell lines : lung cancer , liver cancer , cervical cancer , breast cancer , ovarian cancer , and colon cancer . this is a graph of cell growth at different amla concentrations . here ’ s human breast , liver , and lung cancer cells starting out powering away at 100 % growth . as you drip more amla on , the cancer cell growth rates cut in half and then stopped completely , and then amla starts killing the cancer off — the growth goes negative . by the end more than half the cancer cells dead.here ’ s cervical , ovarian and colorectal . all just decimated by indian gooseberries . and here ’ s the normal cell line — the non- cancerous , at the highest amla levels , that which killed off more than three quarters of the cancer cells , normal cells just seem to get their growth rates slowed down a bit . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check back for the other videos on amla and don ’ t miss all the videos on cancer . and there are 1,449 subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them ! dr.greger , i respect your work very much , but i got to this link by clicking on a fb post that claimed these berries cure cancer and doctors don ’ t want people to know about it . i see that you clarified that the results of the study were most likely not attainable in the body ( i think that ’ s the upshot of what you said ) and that even in the study , their ability to reduce cancer cells was only 25 % . obviously these berries do not cure cancer , though at some point , a cancer treatment may be found that utilizes them in some way . please be careful not to feed the anti-evidence based medicine inclinations of some of the people who frequent your site . those people don ’ t look at clarifications . they take the slightest suggestion and run with it . people with cancer need to follow the advice of a competent physician , not the internet.that ’ s not what i understood from this video . i understood that they did try it on human cancer cells and that their anti tumour abilities went even into the negative range which is tantamount to saying it cures cancer.only in a very distant regard , it kills cancer cells in petrie dishes , that is a far cry from curing cancer in people , smh at scientific illiteracy , study the high success of the hippocrates heath institute with dr. brian clement . he ’ s the first place to go for any cancer situation . he has decades on record for high success.what does that have to do with my comment ? what does “ decades on record for high success ” even mean ? have you heard of the scientific method ? has the guy published anything is a reputable journal ? i think that as you research this website more , you will find that there is a wealth of information indicating that a plant based diet can significantly affect cancer prevention and has potential for cancer reversal.regardless of what i may find on this site , as of now , there is no plant based cure for cancer , the indian gooseberries mentioned simply killed cancer cells in a petri dish , not a human body , which is significant but not terribly significant . implying , in any way , that such cures are out there now , if they cause one person to delay effective treatment for cancer , thus lowering their survival odds , is ethically wrong . period.that site is so full of really bad medicine that it is pathetic , but it is probably pointless to argue with the true believers.you can pee on a petri dish and it will result in cell death , that is not the point . again , i encourage you to research more . a plant based diet is by far the best means in trying to prevent cancer . nobody said 100 % effective , but no doubt the best.my comment had to do with claims that this indian gooseberry could cure cancer and the fact that this article was used online to support one of those “ cancer cures they don ’ t want you to know about ” memes . nothing more . there actually is no evidence that plant based diets prevent cancer , as the kind of study necessary to show that has not been done . there may be studies showing that people who eat a plant based diet are less likely to develop cancer than another group but unless they have a way to control for all of the other variables involved , such a study is not meaningful . i have nothing against plant based diets . but of you think that nobody who eats a plant based diet ever gets cancer , you are fooling yourself . my comment was specific to one post that contained a claim about a cure for cancer . you are trying to make it about everything else that is discussed on this site . it ’ s not . sorry.you can pretty much bet that anytime you see the phrase “ xxx don ’ t want you to know ” , that it is a scam.the amla study involved cell lines and nothing more , i don ’ t understand why this is such a wild audacious video . it was never claimed that in vivo amla can prevent cancer , but it is likely it can help ward it off , it is all about risk management.in addition , when blood from people on a plant based diet is dripped on cancer cell ines , it kills it far more effectively then those who do not consume a plant based diet . there is an abundance of evidence to show that a plant based diet is the best means in preventing cancer . please continue to research before you jump to conclusions . to say “ there is no evidence ” is false , and demonstrates you have not actually researched . no study can 100 % ward off cancer , again , its about risk management. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = cancerwhat earthly sense does it make to drip blood on cancer cells ? what can that possibly mean , or prove ? you say i need do more research and that there is tons of research out there that proves that plant based diets prevent cancer . why don ’ t you start me out with a couple of links to peer reviewed studies published in creible journals ? oh crap ! now you want freaking credible ! ! how rude.are you questioning what we can learn from this ? i think the answer speaks for itself in your absurd question . the collective components of a plant based diet lead to cancer prevention , and there are countless studies showing this . all you have to do is look , as everything here on nutritionfacts.org comes from the literature . i am not going to skim through each video and click the sources cited section and copy and paste , i think you are capable of doing that . here is a starting point. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = cancerand again , don ’ t misconstrue my statements . i have said countless times its about risk management , and a plant based diet by far is the most effective tool in reducing risk of cancer through many mechanisms which are all explained through the videos here.in other words no peer reviewed studies published in credible journals.no , all it takes is a bit of effort on your part if you are truly interested in nutrition . don ’ t get hung up on this amla one . every video has lots of peer reviewed research cited and available . ” why don ’ t you start me out with a couple of links to peer reviewed studies published in creible journals ? ” every video on this website is based on peer reviewed studies , white papers , journal pieces , etc.if you actually would watch some of them , without inserting what you think the meaning is beyond what dr. greger reports about the studies conclusions , you might understand that you are a bit off base.dr. greger has read thousands of the exact types of sources that you want and all the videos are based on said sources with pages from studies right in the videos . are you blind or something.that aside , i have never gotten the impression that i could cure anything from his videos . i think you are projecting fluff medicine that you clearly disagree with , as would many of us here , onto these videos.peer reviewed as in published in reputable journals ? are you sure about that ? seriously ? clearly you refuse to watch any of the videos and you watched this one with your eyes shut.this video shows , on screen ( as do all his videos ) the studies that he is talking about during each part of the videos.european journal of cancer prevention , 2011 vol 20 no. 3 journal of ethnopharmacology 75 ( 2001 ) 65-69 phytotheropy research , phytother . res 24 : 1405-1413 ( 2000 ) use google for crying out loud and read the papers in their entirety and then ask dr greger your questions if you have problems with what is in the reports that he talks about . or , perhaps you can go straight to the authors of each of the papers , journal pieces , studies , etc.it ’ s like you want to argue , ignore people here trying to answer to , ignore the thing called the internet , ignore that his videos have multiple sources displayed on the screen with the exact information that you would need to research more yourself . the title of the study , report , journal piece along with the authors , publisher , date , page numbers , volume , etc.oisome people like to argue needlessly when the answer is readily available , because they like arguing .. thanks for postingcongrats on slaying rebecca , the trolllllll ! ! ! one of those give me science ! , we give her science , and she shrieks , not good enough for me ! ! ! give me a better science ! ! ! btw , rebecca , dr. gregor never purported any sort of one stop cancer cure all in amla … that was your ill-informed facebook friend anyways.i have to agree with you . i ’ ve tried so many supplements , tinctures , whatever that kill cancer in a petri dish . i ’ ve consulted with accomplished nauropathic doctors across the country and they have helped me , however , many things i have tried have not worked for me . and i ’ m a believer that they should . i ’ m on my 4th round of chemo and i ’ ve had 2 extensive surgeries . i went to a clinic in germany but i ’ m still going to try more . chemo is only buying time and thanks to the super foods and organic foods , etc i ’ m able to keep on.agree that in vitro studies are merely a start , and in general often lead down a dead end path rather than a meaningful cure . we can say the same for studies that use animal models . dr. william li did an intriguing ted talk ( http : / / www.ted.com / talks / william _ li ) about anti-angiogenesis factors in some plant foods which offer promise for plant-based dietary cancer prevention . by prevention , i mean reversal before the cancer clinically presents in a manner sufficient for diagnosis.you really need to check other sources than what is on his website , selling his services . these are some of his “ cures ” “ yes , indeed , there it is : enemas , “ infrared saunas , ” and all manner of other quack treatments . but what are “ implants ” ? oh , you naive and silly person ! wheatgrass “ implants ” are , in actuality , wheatgrass juice enemas ” .warren , i am sorry you have an issue with scientific studies , because that is the primary function of this site . the latest evidence is gathered and it is interpreted through the videos . if you want details , you can see the sources sited section . i am not interested in viewing your shared blogs.i have no issue with actual scientific studies . what i have issues with is claims that are not backed with any science , and the “ gooseberry cures cancer ” is one of those.dr. greger never said amla cured cancer , he showed studies with cell lines and its effect on cancer cells , that was all . every claim on this website is backed with scientific evidence.i have cancer and originally started the gerson style diet or dr. lorraine day diet and i went from bed ridden to jogging 4 miles a day and weight training within 3 weeks . then my tumors reduced by 3 quarters . from a golf ball size tumor on my shoulder to a marble . i went back to eating dairy and meat and the you guest it. back in bed . i eventually developed major blood sugar problems and then went to more of a hippocrates diet and the wheat grass is amazing at fighting cancer . go to the real truth about health.com. or watch raw for 30 . you can watch raw for 30 for free on youtube . fighting cancer is all about oxygen and raw foods and their juices are loaded with hormones , phytonutrients , oxygen which all fight cancer and build your immune system . it ’ s all about the inner terrain . clean it up and cancer cannot live in a high oxygen environment.lol – what success ? you might want to read this “ .. i went to the source , the hippocrates health institute website . it didn ’ t take long for me to figure out that its programs were a veritable cornucopia of nearly every quackery on the planet .. ” . that is from a real doctor board certified in cancer treatment. http : / / scienceblogs.com / insolence / 2013 / 12 / 20 / when-false-hope-leads-well-meaning-people-astray / you can be 99 % sure that any ad or claim starts out with “ they don ’ t want to you to know ” is 100 % bullshit.sound quality has been bad past few days.i wanna git me sum ! : - ) it seems like these berries would be great to put on my morning oatmeal rather than those raisins ( “ wonderbread of the fruits ” -ha ! i ’ ll never forget that ) but where to get them ? i tried a quick search on amazon where i found plenty of alma pills , powders and beauty products , but no actual berries.i did find something that proposed to be an alma juice blend , but they didn ’ t list the ingredients and it wasn ’ t organic.i ’ d be curious to hear from people who have tried these berries . what do they taste like ? are they bitter ? the amla berry is widely consumed throughout india . i think you should be able to get them from most indian grocery stores and find recipes online.re : location of amla berry . thanks . i live in a small enough city that we don ’ t have an indian grocery store . i ’ ll look for one the next time i travel to a bigger city.nuts.com. dried berries.i use a dried amla powder . there ’ s no other way to describe the taste other than horrid . even putting it in a large smoothie couldn ’ t hide the bitter , vile taste . regardless , i mix a teaspoon into a half cup of hot water and gulp it down every morning . i close my eyes and think fond thoughts of my beloved mom forcing me to take my cod liver oil as a small child . i ’ ve been taking it for about 3 months now and the most noticeable effect is the regrowth of hair in a previously bald spot in my scalp . cause and effect ? i dunno . but i plan to keep taking it.hair – i bought a bottle of solaray amla 500mg and have been taking one pill each morning . i have a bald spot on the back of my head 3 inches in diameter and it was completely bald . this bald spot has been increasing in size over a period of 20 years . after 45 days of taking the amla i notice that hair is growing back there . i was shocked to see the hair coming back . i have also changed my diet to vegan for the past 4 months . i originally bought the amla for lowering my blood sugar . with the vegan diet , amla , and exercising i have been able to stop using glipizide for my diabetes . a1c was 9.8 and is now 5.3 in just 3 months . my doctor was impressed . and that was without the amla . i still take 1,000 mg of metformin twice a day . i listen to my doctor and hope to reduce other medications for cholesterol and high blood pressure.i tried dried amla for the first time yesterday . yes , it ’ s quite sour … but so is biting into a lemon . today i added it to a tea of sorts , hot water with lemon juice , 1 / 4 tsp. amla and stevia . tasted much better ! the best way my husband and i have been using them is by buying them from the freezer section of the indian grocery store . the powder is generally not good to add to smoothies because it usually contains a significant amount of salt . we buy 12 oz bags of the whole frozen berries for $ 1.50 each.they are fairly large berries ( about the size of a plum ) and contain a very stubborn pit . i don ’ t typically thaw and then refreeze things , but i found thawing out the berries and then slicing around the pit and peeling off the slices from the pit is the easiest way to conveniently manage them . i do a whole bag at once , then freeze the rest of the slices to add to my smoothies later . a few slices go a long way . they have a sour taste and we discovered if you eat one by itself , and then drink water afterwards , the water tastes slightly sweet . ( : back to smoothies … they do mix well , and can be masked by other fruits . they add a thicker pulpy consistency , but i don ’ t find it unpleasant , and i ’ m not typically a huge pulp fan.all and all , they are very cheap , and a great addition to your smoothies . check out the freezer section of your indian grocery next time you are there ! ( : its got a astrigent , bitter & sour taste.but the best of all is , its even sweet .you can feel the sweetness in your mouth after eating this fruit. i had severe acidity ( i could actually feel the acid leaking in my stomach : this was a side effect of an antibiotic prescribed when i was suffering from flu ) even after a meal had digested.i tried allopathy , but it did not help.i googled for some ayurvedic medicine & i found amla which is very reasonable and available everywhere in india. i started taking amla before every meal , it not only cured me of my acidity in two days but the continued usage has helped me regulate my bowels & i am feeling more youthful than before.i had ligament pains in my knees & its dissapeared. amla is helpful in treating diabetes , bloodpressure , arthritis , cholesterol , & many more benefits.how do you eat your amla ? i have found it frozen at indian stores but i am not sure what to do with it and how to prepare it so that it tastes enjoyable.hi toxin , i put 2 in my daily smoothie . even then because it is a tough berry , i need to chew on it sometimes . so , if you have a better blender than mine you may not have to chew at all but go through the actions in order to trigger saliva generation.amla , is arguably the most important medicinal plant in the indian traditional system of medicine , the ayurveda.for more than 5000 years . like gold is to metals amla is to indian herbs the most encouraging data on the fruit has to do with the discovery that two of its constituents — corilagin and dgg-16 — prevent the adherence of low-density lipoprotein ( ldl , or “ bad ” ) cholesterol and monocytes to the insides of blood vessels in an animal model . this means that amla actually decreases the likelihood of plaque building up in the arteries , a process that can cause high blood pressure , circulation problems and many forms of heart diseasecapacity to repair wounds was studied on swiss albino mice the wound healing of amla extract was greater than betaine group in the wound created by excisions method * r.c. agrwal now regarding aloevera , no indian system of healing have ever recommended using whole leaf it always recommended using the purified gell for health benifits aloe is a super herb . it was so done by the western greedy people after which the greedy indians also followedi buy them in the frozen section of the indian grocery . let them thaw a little , then you can cut around the very hard seed , and put it in a smoothie sweetened with something like dates and it tastes fine that way . it tastes like you have added something like a pear to your smoothie . but you cannot eat them alone , or at least i cannot , they are bitter , somewhat spicy and not sweet at all . and never just throw the whole berry in a blender , the very hard seed must be removed.thanks ben ! amla tastes a bit sour & tart . most indian grocery stores now sell amla in the frozen section . i buy the frozen fruit along with organic amla powder from : http : / / www.organicindia.com / banyan botanicals or himalayan institutejp : thanks for your post . since i posted originally 3 years ago , i have had a fair amount of exposure to amla . that ’ s interesting that you are eating the frozen fruit . the only way i can stomach it is if i hide the powder well ( very small amounts in stronger tasting food ) well.thanks for the link . i think lots of people look for good sources . some people have have good success with mountain rose herbs , but it is always nice for alternatives . : - ) based on the graph shown , the normal cell growth rate slowed down by more than just “ a bit ” … the change was by 50 % ! is that an expected finding for a berry ? what side effects may exist ? could this reduce capacity to repair wounds or effect skin / blood cell turnover rate ? please comment.bpcveg : great question . i hope someone more knowledgeable than i also responds . i just wanted to put in 2 cents.you raised some points i hadn ’ t thought of re : wound repair . however , my initial reaction was that slowing normal cell growth would be great . since it is my understanding that every time a cell divides , the end caps get smaller , and at some point , they can ’ t divide any more because of that . thus , the less that your cells divide , the longer you would live.i don ’ t know if that is true or not . i just think it is interesting that i had the opposite reaction that you did in seeing a lowering of 50 % normal cell growth . it looked good to me.i will be very interested to hear from someone who understands the big picture better.thea , thanks for your comment.you make a good point about slowing aging by affecting telomere length.though i ’ m not sure if lowering normal cell growth is always beneficial . during chemotherapy , for example , rapidly growing cells are killed off , leading to severe side effects including depression of the immune system , fatigue , tendency to bleed easily , gastrointestinal problems and hair loss.i ’ m not claiming that the slowed growth of cells due to amla is analogous to chemotherapy . i just am looking for a fair evaluation of any potential side effects.bpcveg : thanks for supplying the ‘ telomere ’ word.also , thanks for expanding your thoughts . your thoughts also make perfect sense to me . i hope you get your “ fair evaluation ” . i want to hear it too.note that the x-axis on that graph is logarithmic – we may not be able to attain levels at the far right hand of the graph physiologically . at the point at which the amla appears to start killing off the cells there appears to just be about a 25 % drop in normal cell growth rate . you ask a great question , though . what effect might that have ? stay tuned for more videos coming up over the ensuing weeks for more on amla ! a corollary question : does amla-attenuated cell growth ( normal cells ) return to normal rates after discontinuing the amla ? i tried the frozen gooseberries and i must say they don ’ t “ jive ” with my palate . they took my logarithmic function and made it very untranscendetal — it tastes like poop ( math joke ) . anyway to make these things tastier ? ! ? ? thanks ! johnnyamish : thanks for your taste report.on the topic of making them tastier . i ’ m not sure if you noticed , but this video on amla is just one video in a series . in a later video , dr. greger talks about putting some amla powder in a smoothie . it ’ s my guess that most people will need to do something like that to mask the taste.i haven ’ t been able to try amla myself yet , but my parents ( who live in a bigger city and have an indian store ) got some frozen amla . they thawed out one of the fruits . according to my parents , it wasn ’ t just tart , but also really bitter . unpalatable to them.we ’ ve talked about getting some amla powder and putting in on oatmeal . would amla powder in oatmeal ruin breakfast or just add nutrition with no taste change or an exautic pleasant taste ? i ’ m hoping for the latter . let us know if you find something that works.also , i ’ ll mention that someone else posted that indians often prepare the berries cooked with chili ( ? -something spicy if i remember correctly ) and salt . so , it may help to think of the food as less of a fruit and more like a strong veggie ? ? ? just a thought.i just bought amla powder and it tastes horrible . i ’ m currently looking for ways to ingest it.sebastian : since i had posted the post you responded you , i too have purchased the amla powder and found it literally made me gag . some people are definitely more sensitive to the taste than other people as i have had friends put the amla in their smoothies and didn ’ t really notice the taste . ( of course the devil is in the details – how much did they put in ? ? ? ) i have found that as long as i don ’ t put too much powder into my oatmeal , the oatmeal tastes just fine . especially when i make my chocolate oatmeal that has a lot of flavors in it . so , i recommend experimenting with amounts . then you will have to see if the amount you can tolerate is a therapeutic amount.in the end , i mostly gave up on the amla . instead i started playing with a berry powder that i got on line that has some amla in it along with a lot of other high-powered berries . while the berry powder tastes a lot better , it is extremely expensive . the product would not be for everyone . plus , since this product has not specifically been tested , i don ’ t know how much of an effect it would have on health.just some thoughts for you . good luck with your amla consuming ! i hope it doesn ’ t go to waste.amla powder is literally the most disgusting thing i have ever tried . to give you an example , after drinking it , i always drink some water to wash the taste . well , after the amla , my taste buds find this pure water sweet ! anyhow , i found a way to take it . i mix half a teaspoon of amla twice a day ( so in total a teaspoon ) in water and quickly drink it . from the videos the doc poster , a teaspoon should give enough health benefits . i also tried adding erythritol to the water , but it somehow made it yuckier . as a side note , my dermatitis / rosacea has improved dramatically . i ’ m not sure if it ’ s the amla , the fact that this week i ’ m avoiding all spices or if it ’ s the hempseed in my beans or the hempseed flour in my oatmeal.amla gooseberries taste like sour grapes ! rivka : after the post above , i did eventually buy some powdered amla and “ got ” to taste it . i think “ sour grapes ” is being generous . : - ) but it really seems like taste buds differ quite a bit regarding amla . i ’ ve spoken to some people who really don ’ t mind it . where as i gagged the first time i tried it . lately i have been putting some into my savory morning oatmeal . i don ’ t taste it at all in there . that ’ s the key to getting me to consume the stuff – hide it.the after taste of the bitterness of amla , is what chinese people refer to as the 5th taste – a subtle sweetness that follows the bitter taste . such sweet-ish after taste is similar to sucking a licorice bark . so , perhaps you can try focus on appreciating the after taste instead ? it is indeed an acquired taste.anyhow. if you can find chinese herbal shop in your neighborhood i stead of indian grocery shop , they should have the dried indian gooseberries , smaller ( size of a cherry when fresh ) than their genuine indian cousin but exactly the same thing . they are called 油甘子 。 i hope they possess the same phytonutritional values as the indian version.dragon : re : ” perhaps you can try focus on appreciating the after taste instead ? ” that ’ s a thought . i ’ m pretty sensitive to bitter tastes . but i ’ m also a believer in changing one ’ s taste buds when it is in our best interests to do so.re : “ i hope they possess the same phytonutritional values as the indian version . ” unless it is biologically the same plant , perhaps just harvested earlier to make it smaller , then i wouldn ’ t expect it to be the same phytonutritional values . but maybe just as good ? ? ? thanks for sharing.i tried putting amla powder in soup and it made the soup sour . i purchased size-00 empty gel capsule and filled them with the amla powder . i take 5 of these a day and it equals 1 tsp.whoah ! what an incredible idea ! i didn ’ t even know one could this . thanks for the input ! organic india … . i got a one lb bag for like 15.00 in local indian spice store.my friend has had 1 kidney removed in july ( cancer ) and now faces the spread of cancer in her lungs , liver .

( i am still in the midst of a rather stressful situation from an accident my husband had last summer which left him brain injured . he has made great strides , but is still not completely himself yet . the doctor said stress can increase blood sugar . ) i do not want to go on drugs because the side effects sound really scary , and was wondering if amla ( i bought some frozen fruit today , the 12th , and ate 2 berries ) might help me . i see my doctor for my annual check-up on the 26th of this month . thanks for any help and keep up the great work and service you are providing the public ! you are a god-send , dr. greger ! ♥ a few years back i had a double hernia surgery from an incisional hernia and an umbilical hernia from childhood . i suppose the hernia is “ taken care of ” but i now have a small would in my belly button . it is a small hole that oozes and i use rubbing alcohol on it to keep clean . the doctor was simply cauterizing it for quite sometime and appeared to be closing up but not completely . surgery was other option to fix it but i haven ’ t gone back since in hopes of finding a way to heal myself through nutrition . you briefly mention wound healing in reference to this video on indian gooseberries . would incorporating this into my diet actually be beneficial in helping to heal ? ? hi , i ’ ve been using the amla powder for the past 3 months . my understanding is that to make the powder they just dry the berries in the sun and then grind them up . i ’ m not aware of any negative side effects and was not sure of a dosage but i have been putting a heaping tablespoon of it in my morning oatmeal . with the heaping part it is probably closer to two tablespoons . relative to the amounts you have been discussing this is much higher levels . i notice the flavor , but even at that high level i don ’ t find it objectionable . my morning oatmeal mix is my own concoction that i do ahead in large batches in the slow cooker over night . my current recipe is 2 cups steel cut oats , 1 cup pot barley , 1 cup toasted wheat germ , about 3 / 4 cups of dried cranberries , about 3 / 4 cup of golden raisins , i then add a healthy blop ( very precise measurement you can see : ) ) of blackstrap molasses . when after i heat up my oatmeal i add 2 1 / 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed , then the heaping tablespoon of amla powder ( i get it at an indian grocery store and the large bag is only $ 1.00 and usually lasts me a couple of weeks . ) . i then add about 1 / 4 – 1 / 2 cup of hemp seeds and top it off with vanilla flavored soy milk . there is enough sweetness to counteract most of the bitterness of the amla and i love it and look forward to it every morning . i have not noticed any negative effects or any real positive ones other than my wife and mother-in-law keep saying my skin looks amazing . i add it for the antioxidants , the diabetes effects ( i ’ m type 2 diabetic and my last a1c was down to 5.0 and my physician was ecstatic . i also have been on blood pressure meds for years and i am totally off those with current blood pressure at 118 / 72 ( i have been vegan for past 6 months and have lost 100 lbs in past year so i can ’ t attribute everything to amla by any stretch , but it does not seem to hurt . ) . i am also taking it as a way to try and help prevent cancers or slow them down , but purely as a preventive measure . i also liked the described cholesterol effects but since going vegan i don ’ t have much concern about that , but any positive is good ) if anyone has any information on medicinal dosage levels i would like to know . if anyone knows of any problems with amla consumption i would also be interested in knowing . there were a number of complaints about taste posted and questions on how to mask the flavor . the above works great for me at even a high dose . you have to make sure you mix it well or you get a lump of amla powder on the spoon sometimes . : ) steve : thanks for sharing your recipe and story . it sounds like you are doing so well . congrats on taking your health into your own hands and fixing things ! i had a chance to speak to dr. gregor at vegetarian summerfest in johnstown , pa about the amount of amla i was taking every day . he said it seemed like a lot . ( what he actually said was “ my god man , have you no taste buds ! ? you must be taking more amla than anyone on the planet ! ” ) : ) he said it might be good for me and i may be ahead of the research but that there is no evidence or studies at that level currently . he said the amla powder was so pharmacologically active and there was no data for higher levels so he recommended cutting back to one teaspoon of the amla powder a day as was used in one of the studies he quoted . basically go with the best data to date and not try to extrapolate further until more data becomes available . seemed like a good well reasoned response so i have cut back to the single teaspoon a day even though i had not noticed any problems at the higher level thanks dr. gregor.congrats steve on your hard won successes ! i can relate , your story sounds similar to my own , i just wish i hadn ’ t waited for a crisis to implement the smart changes . better late than never i guess ? anyway , gotta get me some of that amla , it sounds like one of those things you dare each other to taste as kids ! lol ! that ’ s funny charzie … i remember daring each other to taste stuff like hot sauce or baking chocolate … yuk . i add a bit of date sugar to my amla laced smoothies and it adds a mild sweetness or at least counteracts the extreme tartness of amla . it is a pure unrefined natural sweeter . actually all it is is dried and ground dates . its low calorie ( 1 tsp = 10 calories ) , however it can be a bit expensive . also , you can make your own with a dehydrator.lol , ah what child could resist the lure of baking chocolate ! yuk ! i ’ m with ya on the dates too , i use them a lot in my smoothies but i usually just use the pitted dates because they are cheaper . i ’ m on a fixed income so i ’ m the queen of cheap ! i grow my own sprouts , have a little garden , bake my own bread , make my own plant milks and vegan yogurts and cheese , fermented veggies and whatever else i can to cut costs . i live in fl so my next venture is to cobble together a solar dehydrator i saw on mother earth news made out of cardboard ! lol ! even i can afford that ! where there ’ s a will there ’ s a way ! charzie : you are an inspiration ! thanks for your post.forgot to mention in my oatmeal recipe that i add 9 cups of water in the slow cookersorry again , the flax seed , amla , hemp seed and soy milk are all added to the individual bowl of oatmeal when i go to eat itmy gastroenterologist flatly stated that there was no cure for the “ persistent carpet like polyp ” he had been controlling with burning for two years . however when i drank amla tea upon rising and before retiring at night for three weeks prior to my next colonoscopy , the polyp was just a few small , eroded looking patches instead of the previously observed continuous carpet like polyp.i am hopeful the next exam finds a complete absence of the polyp . the doctor had previously concluded a section of my colon would have to be removed due to worsening conditions . now he says it is not needed.skingk : wow . that ’ s amazing . i think that ’ s so cool . it sounds like you may have saved yourself a great deal of pain , money and hassle . good for you and i ’ ll keep my fingers crossed for you . thanks for sharing ! awesome … great news ! very inspiring . your post was 9 months ago . is there an update ? instead of twice a year , i now have annual colonoscopies scheduled . the doc says he ’ ll be convinced if there is no carpet like polyp at the next exam . it ’ s a fairly rare thing as only two other of the doc ’ s hundreds of patients have it.great. thanks for letting me know.i found a good source to buy amla online – including dehydrated amla ( from which you can make a ‘ decoction ' : simmer 3 tablespoons of dehydrated amla in 1 qt. of water for 30 – 40 minutes – then mix with an equal amount o d green or white tea ) .http : / / www.mountainroseherbs.com … ( 541 ) 741-7307 .. ask for “ halsey ” .. tell her “ richard sent you ” : ) i just bought a pound of dehydrated certified organic / kosher alma for $ 11.00.they also have bulk white tea.hope this helps ! : ) richard that is an exceptional value at $ 11 usd per pound . i managed to get my costs down to $ 13 per pound by buying 5 lb bags but your source is superior to that arrangement . thank you for posting … you ’ ve saved me significant $ $ .bt – you ’ re welcome ! : ) btw , what are you using amla for , and how – if you don ’ t mind me asking ? i ’ m going to start using it for a mouthwash , since i have problems with my gums . but i thought about using it preventatively “ for the rest of me ” in capsule form , too.richardi use it as a preventative measure for general health and its properties for anti-cancer cell growth . i use in smoothies but also load capsules for those times when smoothies aren ’ t available like when traveling . go to amazon and look at the capsule machine for size 00 or 000 capsules since i ’ m trying to get a tsp. full with each daily dose .. you want a big enough capsule so you don ’ t spend a week loading them or need to carry 200 for three days dosage . for mouthwash i find that a 1 : 1 ratio of hydrogen peroxide and water has remarkable curative effect – just swish for 30 seconds or so and spit.it costs less than 20 cents per kg. fresh amla in india wholesale . big cities like mumbai retail costs $ 1 per kilogram.looks like your picture illustrating amla is of the standard gooseberry ( ribes ) rather than the indian phyllanthus / emblicais amla in capsule form as effective as powdered amla ? i was told dr. greger suggests looking into terrafoods for amla gooserries . is it terrasoul ? i can ’ t find terrafoods . anyone else have an other suggestions ? would about for goji berries ? dr greger scheduled to tell everything he knows about eating # plantbased to treat and manage # cancer at : http : / / iaacn.org / symposiumrivka : cool . thanks for that link . sounds like a great talk . nice to see dr. greger is doing something like that.try chinese herbal shop and ask for 油多子 。 it is the same thing , only smaller in size.sorry , fotgot to mention that you will need to ask the chinese herbal shop to powder the dried 油甘子 for you . some shops do offer powdering dried herbs , that is if you buy the herbs from them in the first place.dr. gregor , just a quick question about this video clip . at the end you mentioned that normal cells also reduce in size sightly . are these cells that should shrink in size or are there potential issues associated with these cells slightly reducing in size ? thanksgood question . i ’ m not sure it was significant , but yes normal cells were affected by amla , however , the dramatic drop in cancerous cell growth perhaps outweighs that risk , but of course human trials are needed.i have to say , as a cancer patient , i want to believe more than anyone that a plant based diet and herbs could replace chemo . however , i do feel that , while it is great to eat healthy , if this diet was a cure it would be highly recommended by doctors . i do think that there might be some truth to money making being an issue with natural remedies , but i also think that people truly want to find a cure . if all outside variables could be illiminated and scientific proof was availible that plant based diets could get rid of lymphoma these studies would replace drugs. alternative medicine , amla , anemia , ayurvedic medicine , berries , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , cancer , cardiovascular disease , cervical cancer , cervix health , cholesterol , colon cancer , colon health , complementary medicine , cough , diarrhea , fever , fruit , gooseberries , hair health , heart disease , heart health , in vitro studies , india , kidney health , kiwi fruit , ldl cholesterol , liver cancer , liver disease , liver health , lung cancer , lung disease , lung health , nerve health , ovarian cancer , ovary health , pain , rectal cancer , skin health , snake venom , stomach health , stress , wound healing indian gooseberries ( amla ) , an important plant in ayurvedic medicine , may have anti-cancer properties , as well as cough- , fever- , pain- , stress- , and diarrhea-suppressing effects . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check back for the other videos on amla and don 't miss all the videos on cancer . and there are 1,449 subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them !
PLAIN-3073	glycotoxins advanced glycation end products , age ’ s , appropriately acronymed , as they are considered gerontotoxins , geronto as in gerontology , these are aging toxins , thought to accelerate the aging process , the multisystem decline in anatomic integrity and function . age ’ s crosslink proteins together causing tissue stiffness , oxidative stress and inflammation . in the brain they may contribute to dementia , in the eye cataracts and macular degeneration . in the arteries and heart , hypertension , atherosclerosis , heart failure and stroke , then anemia , kidney disease , osteoporosis and muscle loss.there are two sources of these toxins . one , we can ’ t do much about — they ’ re produced internally as natural waste products of metabolism , but source number 2 is our diet.research in the 70 ’ s on rats found that age ’ s weren ’ t absorbed very well and so dietary sources were dismissed as irrelevant , until 25 years later when we finally tested people , and low and behold , we found that diet-derived ages that are absorbed into the bloodstream may represent a major source of chemically and biologically active toxins. and so we should eliminate the foods and modes of cooking associated with the highest age content . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check out other videos on aging . and there are 1,449 subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them ! dr. greger , firstly regarding age ’ s , most studies discuss forms of cooking ( frying , roasting , boiling etc . ) but make no mention of the impact microwaving has on age production ? could you illuminate us please ? also in an unrelated area , how do you feel about evista vs.bisphophonates for early osteoporosis in the spine and as a means to slow down ostepenia in the hip ? the glycation reaction of sugar with a protein or fat occurs above 120 degrees . so microwaving food should also yield age ’ s . cooking provides many benefits but varies from type to type see : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / best-cooking-method / for information . i don ’ t recommend any medications for osteopenia and only in isolated cases for osteoporosis . i would read the articles written by john mcdougall md in his newsletters especially the october 2004 newsletter.got to his website , click on the read more link under hot topics and click on osteoporosis to see a list of these newsletters . dr. amy lanou wrote an excellent easy to read and thorough book , building bone vitality , for people concerned about bone health . i would recommend that you read that as well . her conclusion about animal protein is not supported by the meta analysis reviewed by dr. greger : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-protein-bad-to-the-bone / . what is clear is that regular weight bearing exercise and good nutrition are important . i recommend a plant based diet along with weight bearing exercise . getting repeat testing periodically to monitor bmd helps sort out this issue . it is important to work with your physician in weighing the benefits and risks of non pharmacologic approaches vs biphosphonates , estrogen and / or thiazide diuretics.can you offer any guidance for vegans and vegetarians . i just perused “ advanced glycation end products in foods and a practical guide to their reduction in the diet ” . ( uribarri , journal american dietetic association june 2010 volume 110 number 6 ) with the exceptions of whole wheat bread and some olive oil , vegans do not eat the foods listed . ￼ take taurine.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 15607576 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 18834896is it okay and effective to take taurine for regular vegans just trying to minimize age ’ s ? i mean these articles seem to recommend it for patients with renal failure , not particularly for every vegetarian / vegan . perhaps a new study will give us better insight soon ! yeah , that first link says : “ thus , a taurine supplemented low-fat vegan diet may be recommended as a strategy for minimizing age-mediated complications in diabetics and in patients with renal failure . ” i don ’ t know how this applies to those who aren ’ t diabetic or have renal failure . maybe the full text explains more but that costs money to read.are ages a specific type of free radical , or are they a totally different type of toxin ? i have a question regarding the use of hydrogen peroxide internally . i ’ m not finding much information on the subject and i have a family member who ’ s looking into it based on some ( limited ) online research . thoughts and feedback would be apprecaited.yikes ! hydrogen peroxide should never be taken internally . it can cause irritation of the gastrointestinal tract with nausea , vomiting , and foaming at the mouth ( the foam may obstruct the respiratory tract or result in pulmonary aspiration ) . within minutes of ingestion , confusion , coma , convulsions , cyanosis and cardiorespiratory arrest may ensue . oxygen gas embolism in the brain may cause a stroke even after just a few sips . most problems occur at concentrations > 10 % , but even dilute solutions can be toxic . if your family member wants to oxygenate their blood they should try exercising.what do you make of the study showing vegetarians had higher levels of ages ? im assuming they were unlikely to be consuming more ages in the diet so what is the likely cause ? could low carnosine be the issue ? i think the researchers attributed it to higher honey ( fructose ) consumption.this comment made me do some googling and you ’ re right . veg * ns do have higher age levels according to several studies . apparently taurine powerfully works against glycation so it ’ s probably not a bad idea to take 150-400 mg of taurine a day . i linked above to some relevant research.note : i ’ m not a doctor.the one study that found higher levels in vegetarians appears to have been a fluke . a larger study performed by the same research group ( 90 vegetarians compared to the original 19 ) did not find significantly higher age levels . mccarty ’ s hypothesis paper about taurine was published before the new data came out.disappointing … i was hoping vegetarians would have significantly lower levels . i wonder where they get the age intake.thrilled to see your point about the 2006 study and , as a phd holder myself am impressed by your professionalism with research by others.are there ages found in baked potatoes , air popped popcorn , plain puffed 100 % whole grain brown rice cakes ? i have reviewed the tables at the back of the paper . the authors have included ages from a number of foods , albeit not enough that most followers of your posts probably eat.let us make it practical : where is a list of the foods that contain loads of ages ? without that your video is just futile … please click on the next up video above , to get the next video in the series ( avoiding a sugary grave ) which does exactly that.hello dr.greger. i am interested in finding the linkeage between a.g.e.s and male infertility . i hypothesise that the linkeage is probably o.s. ( oxidative stress ) , r.o.s. ( reactive oxygen species ) and dna fragmentation . but it is something i have to find evidence and the way it is happening . on the other hand , after watching a lot of your videos , i wonder whether the diet intake plays a second role or even the first role between a.g.e.s and male infertility . i would appreciate any kind of help . thank you . ( excuse me for my rusty english ) at 1 : 00 this video claims there ’ s little we can do about endogenous age production ( much from the methylglyoxal produced during normal glycolysis ) , butwe have an enzyme to deal with it , lactoylglutathione lyase ( or glyoxselase i ) , a transcriptional switch in nrf2 ( pmid : 22188542 ) which happens to turn on a bunch of protective enzymes including glyoxselase i , and a common food chemical that induces the nrf2 switch , sulforaphane ( many citations , can ’ t find the original discovery ) .where can we find sulforaphane ? all of the cruciferous vegetables , from broccoli to wasabi , include the glucosinolate precursors converted to sulforaphane upon chewing . it appears cabbage has the highest sulforaphane content among cruciferous vegetables ( sorry , kale ) ( see farag et al . “ sulforaphane composition , cytotoxic and antioxidant activity of crucifer vegetables ” . 2010 ) . , thanks ! good to know.only upon chewing cruciferous veggies , or is it converted also upon blending , juicing or krauting ? what are your thoughts on vegans / vegetarians supplementing with low to moderate doses of synthetic taurine and carnosine ( or its precursor , beta-alanine ) for the sole purpose of reducing endogenous advanced glycation end product creation and development ? i know you generally don ’ t recommend supplements and that they can sometimes cause more harm than good , but these two amino acids can only be found in animals , so it seems there is no whole foods way to obtain the seemingly beneficial effects of carnosine and taurine for a vegan.i ’ m also particularly concerned because of the recent news that carnitine and choline are digested into tmao . perhaps i ’ m a bit paranoid that maybe taurine , carnosine , or creatine may have similar processes as carnitine that i don ’ t know about since they are all animal-based amino acids . by that same logic , would supplementing with carnosine and taurine continue to promote colonies of animal protein-consuming gut bacteria that i ’ m trying to eliminate by switching to a plant-based diet ? thanks ! our bodies make taurine and carnosine . the side-effects or potential harms with carnosine ( or beta-alanine ) supplementation seem to outweigh any potential benefit . taurine supplementation doesn ’ t seem to have any side effects or potential harms ( that i can find ) , so that would most likely be just a case of wasted money if our bodies are producing all we need . i also wonder about the tmao thing since that was just discovered.it ’ s carnitine that leads to tmao , not carnosine.unless there is evidence that carnosine doesn ’ t cause tmao , we can ’ t be sure . besides , carnosine may increase your risk for cancer due to it ’ s effect on telomeres . i ’ m taking the safer route of trusting my body to make the correct amount of carnosine ( and taurine , carnitine , creatine , etc ) from other amino acids found in plant foods.if you have osteoporosis , is it better to not take medication like fosomax and instead treat the bone weakness with plant based high calcium foods and exercise ? i am taking the medication , but don ’ t like the side effects . isn ’ t plant based nutrition and exercise a better and more effective remedy for osteoporosis ? please read the book biological transmutation by dr. kirvran or the chapter in the secret life of plants about biological transmutation by christopher bird for the understanding about potassium , magnesium and silica-containing foods interacting with hydrogen , oxygen and carbon and turning into our bones ’ calcium . the supplemental calcium or the foods high in calcium do not help our bone density and has never been known to approach a human bone ; this element calcium lines the myelin sheath of our nerves and makes us feel more peaceful.dawn : have you read the book , “ building bone vitality : a revolutionary diet plan to prevent bone loss and reverse osteoporosis ? ” it ’ s a great book , with a ton of science to back it up . it ’ s a quick read and focuses mainly on the benefits of a plant based diet – with details on what to focus on . it even has some recipes and menu plans . and a chapter addressing drugs. http : / / www.amazon.com / building-bone-vitality-revolutionary-osteoporosis – without / dp / 0071600191 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ twi _ 1 ?

PLAIN-3084	how the institute of medicine arrived at their vitamin d recommendation there are many ways to arrive at a target vitamin level . we ’ ve already examined some of the problems inherent to just using deficiency disease prevention and evolutionary arguments to establish an optimum intake . if a vitamin only does one thing , then it ’ s easy , you set the level at whatever the body needs to do one thing best , but what if the vitamin affects dozens of different organs , then it ’ s more difficult . here 's a list of the target tissues affected by vitamin d. in revising their recommendations , the institute of medicine decided to only look at one tissue , bone , which many considered to be a mistake . i did like how they went about it , though . they asked the expert : the human body . when our body senses we don ’ t have enough active vitamin d for adequate bone health it releases a hormone , called pth , to boost our levels . and so the institute of medicine figured why don ’ t we just listen in on the body ’ s own innate wisdom and find out which level of vitamn d it feels comfortable with for bone health . and that number is about 20 ng / ml , here as 50 nanomole per liter . once we fall below that our body is like uh , oh , and starts producing this pth to protect our bones from softening . but that ’ s just the bone ; what about the other 3 dozen organs affected by vitamin d ? please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . this is the seventh video in a nine day series on vitamin d. be sure to check out yesterday ’ s video-of-the-day the difficulty of arriving at a vitamin d recommendation.in the list of tissues involved with vitamin d , there ’ s something called the eggshell gland . what ’ s that ? do humans have this eggshell gland or is it found in birds only ? good eye ! that ’ s just in birds and some fish and reptiles ( though presumably in platypuses as well ? ) . it ’ s part of their oviducts that forms the eggshells.hello , can u let me knw wat are the effects of vit d deficiency in adults .. and wat if the level is below 5 ng / ml .. ? the effects of vit d deficiency are many as you can see from the list on the right side of this video ’ s diagram . it is always difficult to say which effects occur in an individual . however a level of 5 ng / ml would be considered deficient by any recommendations . for further discussion see : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / vitamin-d-recommendations-changed / . the best way to keep our vitamin d levels at the appropriate level is to get adequate sunlight see : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / vitamin-supplements-worth-taking / . for individuals with very low levels as you mention i would recommend working with a physician to get recommendations and appropriate followup.there was a ny times story several days ago noting a study suggesting that crp levels went up once blood vitamin d levels reached 21ng / ml .

PLAIN-3096	phytochemicals : the nutrition facts missing from the label it ’ s one thing to show alzheimer 's benefits in a petri dish , it ’ s quite another to show benefit in a human population . that came two years later . about 1800 people were followed for about 8 years . at the beginning of the study they asked how often everybody drank any kind of juice and then sat back and watched to see who would get alzheimers . by the end of the study , it appeared that those who drank fruit and vegetable juices had a 76 % lower risk of developing alzheimers . they conclude that “ fruit and vegetable juices may play an important role in delaying the onset of alzheimer ’ s disease . ” what could it be ? here ’ s the nutrition facts label for purple grape juice on the left . according to the labels , there ’ s basically nothing in it . not even any vitamin c. and indeed that ’ s what the study found , even after controlling for antioxidant vitamin intake — vitamin e , vitamin c , beta carotene , still , a quarter the risk of alzheimers . based on the nutrition label you ’ d think it was just sugar water , practically indistinguishable from coca cola — in fact it ’ s got even more sugar — 9 spoonfuls per cup compared to 7 in coke , but it just looks like sugar water because the labels don ’ t list phytonutrients . if they did , the coke label would remain the same , but the grape juice label would spill down , and roll along the floor like santa ’ s list . and this would be like the first page of the list . there are thousands of phytonutrients in fruits and vegetables , missing in junk foods and animals foods , yet never listed on the labels.the leading candidate class of compounds responsible for the protection against alzheimers are the phenolics , like flavones , and flavonones , and flavonols , which in many cases can rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier . there are more than 5,000 different types of flavonoids in the plants we eat . research suggests that within minutes of biting into an apple , for example , these phytonutrients are already starting to light up our brain . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and be sure to check out all the videos on phytonutrients , and yesterday ’ s video amyloid and apple juice.wow , never even thought of this , and i guess neither do most people . thanks ! i wonder how well all of these phytochemicals do with various forms of cooking processes , seeing as studies have only been done for a few of them , such as lycopene ?

PLAIN-3114	plant protein preferable the dietary recommendations of countries that rely on their health departments to formulate them rather than their agriculture departments more closely parallel the recommendations of academics such as walter willet , the chair of harvard ’ s nutrition department , who , in his essentials of healthy eating guide talks about picking the best “ protein packages , recognizing that food is a package deal and so one of his top 3 recommendations is we should emphasize plant sources of protein rather than animal sources.see , to the metabolic systems engaged in protein production and repair , it doesn 't matter whether amino acids come from animal or plant protein . however , protein is not consumed in isolation . instead , it is packaged with a host of other nutrients . the " baggage " that i refer to in previous videos . the quality and amount of fats , carbohydrates , sodium , and other nutrients in the ‘ ‘ protein package ’ ’ may influence long-term health . for example , results from the harvard nurses ’ health study suggest that eating more protein from beans , nuts , seeds , and the like — while cutting back on refined carbohydrates like white flour — reduces the risk of heart disease.so the bottom line … go with plants . eating a plant-based diet is healthiest . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check out all the videos on dietary guidelines and heart disease . if you ’ re worried about the gassiness of beans , check out my blogpost clearing the air . and as always , there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos – please feel free to explore them ! so doc , can you direct me to any of your videos that rate the top protein rich veggies ? you are changing lives – mine and my kids , especially ! thank you.hello cocowillie , when i tell people i don ’ t eat animal products the first thing i hear is “ where do you get your protein ? ” . it is in fact , a myth , that plant foods are not complete proteins and in reality , all fruits and vegetables contain complete proteins so there is no need to compliment 2 foods for a full amino acid profile . if you eat when your hungry , energy expenditures satisfy protein intake . the american dietetic association acknowledges this fact as well “ plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met . research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults ; thus , complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal ” http : / / www.vrg.org / nutrition / 2009 _ ada _ position _ paper.pdf plant foods such as spinach contain more of a percentage of protein than beef . for example , spinach is 51 % protein and mushrooms are 35 % while beef is 36 % protein.furthermore , regarding our actual requirements for protein . for the average human being , male or female , the minimum has been set to 20 grams per day . this is according to dr. william rose of the university of illinois back in 1942 . dr. john mcdougall states that our body only uses about 10 grams of protein per day since we don ’ t actually store protein but use it as our body needs http : / / www.nealhendrickson.com / mcdougall / 031200puprotein.htm the world health organization states “ adequate levels of protein intake are recommended to be 0.45 grams of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight per day ” . http : / / whqlibdoc.who.int / trs / who _ trs _ 935 _ eng.pdf for me weighing at 150 pounds , that comes out to about 30 grams of protein per day . note that the world health organization states this as a “ safe ” level , meaning it is not a minimum . bottom line is , our body doesn ’ t need a large amount of protein , and since all plant foods contain more than adequate protein quality and levels , to focus on eating a “ protein ” is not necessary . if you eat when your hungry and till your full on a plant based diet , you are getting more than enough protein . if anything , in today ’ s society we should be worried about getting too much protein since too much protein gets broken down to uric acid and strains our kidneys . let me know if you have any other questions , such as omega 3 requirements or any other question of the sorts.on another topic , check out this video on cancer prevention using whole plant foods ! http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / plant-based-prevention / this whole “ complete protein ” business is confusing . yes , all plant foods contain all essential amino acids . but most are not in the perfect proportion necessary for us to build our own human protein . in my experience , the two amino acids to watch are lysine and methionine . they are usually the limiting amino acids . whole grains are usually low in lysine , legumes are usually low in methionine . plus , there are a few nonessential amino acids that are not present in plant foods , so in that sense plant protein is indeed incomplete . in my experience 2000 calories of plant foods supplies 63-73 g of protein . not bad.grains and legumes together supply a complete protein . it used to be believed that you had to eat them at the same time in order to get the complete benefit , but that has been proven false . as long as you eat a diet of grains and legumes , your body will get all of the proteins that it needs . non essential proteins are not needed in the diet , hence being called “ non essential . ” when eating a plant-based diet , it ’ s difficult to become protein deficient unless you ’ re consuming nothing but fruits and junk food . i did a detailed breakdown of all the essential amino acids in some plant foods using the who ’ s recommended daily intakes . find the results on my blog , here : http : / / debunkingnutrition.blogspot.ca / 2013 / 09 / are-plant-proteins-complete-proteins.html “ yes , all plant foods contain all essential amino acids ” that ’ s false.the term “ complete protein ” refers to amino acids , the building blocks of protein . there are 22 different amino acids that can form a protein , and nine that the body can ’ t produce on its own . these are called essential amino acids — we need to eat them because we can ’ t make them ourselves . in order to be considered “ complete , ” a protein must contain all nine of these essential amino acids in roughly equal amounts.baggman744 : i was with you until you said “ in roughly equal amounts . ” i don ’ t know why you would think we need them in equal amounts ?

if so , then isn ’ t it misleading to present spinach as being 51 % protein ? it just sets us up to be exposed as frauds.perhaps the measurements in your quote are by dry weight.one is percent of calories , the other is percent by weight.if not a percentage of weight , it could be percentage of volume … like 1 cup of spinach contains … etc . so you have percent of calories , percent of weight , or percent of volume – it all depends what is being measured.since there are alot of ways to measure you might look at the actual data . a website i find useful is cronometer.com.thanks doc . there is a daily argument in our house about the amount of almond and soy milk i drink . i do not drink cow ’ s milk unless i run out of the other stuff . any concerns about the amount of almond or soy ? keep up the good fight ! hello again cocowillie , i am actually not a doctor , just someone who researches nutrition obsessively and tries to stay informed ! to answer your question , almond milk is fine , but be weary of soy milk if you plan on drinking it with fruits or veggies . check out this video for details.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / soymilk-suppression / also , soymilk , specifically for young girls is another thing to be cautious of. check out this video for details. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / the-effect-of-soy-on-precocious-puberty / all in all , i would say almond milk is the safest choice of the 2.so you ’ re saying drinking soy milk with fruits , blocks the absorption of phytonutrients from fruits ? i ’ ve been loading my oatmeal ( with soy milk ) with fruits , in the hope that i could absorb the most of the powerful nutrients . should i eat fruits separately ? the second video also suggests that soy milk may promote health and reduce the risk for future breast cancer by delaying pubertal breast development.i often wonder , with so much soy being genetically engineered to be herbicide resistant and sell more health damaging chemicals in the world , if the studies are really promoting better health , or the earning potential to monsanto , dow , and other biotech-pesticide companies ? i ingest soy products sparingly , especially after consuming 1 / 2 cup of organic soy milk , and having my first severe case of either indigestion or acid reflux . don ’ t know what it was , but i really felt ill . and it happened just days apart on two different “ milks ” , one made from organic soy ( by a company that regularly samples and tests its product for gmo ’ s ) , and the other from a non organic quinoa milk producer . other containers bought earlier from both companies showed no adverse side effects but i ’ m now looking for another calcium-magnesium source to add to my oatmeal in the morning . life would be so much easier if we had mandatory labeling and the right to know in north america if the foods we buy or ingest are made from gmo ’ s . ( both products claimed they were free of gmo ’ s ) , but they still could be contaminated from pollen or drift from roundup , one of the most prolific pesticides in the air , soils , and waters , including rainwater in the usa . and side effects of ingesting glyphosate also appear a lot like gerd.the national sunday paper here has run a three week series on the benefits of the dukan diet. http : / / www.bodyandsoul.com.au / collections / all + about + the + dukan + diet , 207 ( eeek ! ) do you have any studies that show just how harmful this type of diet can be ? this is sickening to me “ the dukan diet starts with a short , sharp attack phase where you eat nothing but protein – just meat , fish , eggs and ( unlike atkins ) no-fat or low-fat dairy products . this is the kick-start that gives you the initial , rapid weight loss ( up to three kilograms in just five days ) , and sets the tone for the other stages of the plan . stay on the attack phase for one to 10 days depending on how much weight you have to lose.the problem here is that they are not shedding fat weight but water weight . this is from dr. mcdougall , a plant based advocate “ the initial weight loss is rapid , and therefore very rewarding , for the desperate dieter . most of this loss , however , is water loss , rather than fat loss . with little carbohydrate in the diet the body resorts to using its glycogen stores of glucose . glycogen , stored in the liver and muscles , can meet the average person ’ s glucose needs for about 12 to 18 hours . with each gram of glycogen is stored 2.7 grams of water . the average body stores 300 grams of glycogen . depletion of the body ’ s glycogen would result in an almost overnight weight loss of 1110 grams ( 37 ounces or over 3 pounds ) . the ketones also cause a strong diuretic effect on the kidneys , resulting in losses of large amounts of fluid . the carbohydrate ceiling for weight loss may be as low as 15 grams , depending on the individual . this is only 60 calories of carbohydrate , which means 1 / 3 of a baked potato , 1 / 3 cup of rice , or one orange daily could be your limit of carbohydrate intake in order to remain in sufficient ketosis to suppress your appetite . ” read the article dr. mcdougall posted and you will see it elaborates on why the high protein diet is so harmful . link below http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / res _ high _ protein _ diets.htmli feel sorry for people ’ s bodies if they are on the dukan diet.logic is clearly out the window when it comes to weight loss diet desperation.i did the high protein diet we called atkins in the 70s . lost weight really fast , but knew nothing of ketosis then . i was young and failed to stay on it . because most people can ’ t maintain it , they / we don ’ t cause ourselves irreparable harm . many of the ‘ sudden onset kidney failures later in life , i read , can be traced to a high protein diet over a life time . there is often no warning . i really don ’ t want to take that chance … .it ’ s a no for me ! the dukan diet appears to be like the european version of the atkins diet . the uk national health service just highlighted that the dukan diet is the fad diet to avoid this holiday season , citing the british dietetic association ’ s conclusion that it is “ ineffective and without scientific basis . ” i wrote a whole book about these these types of diets , carbophobia : the scary truth behind america ’ s low carb craze , available free , full-text at atkinsexposed.org.thanks dr. greger for the link ! always great to have references like this , thank you.i ’ ve been hearing more and more about the fact that legumes and grains have lectins and saponins in them , and that they are anti-nutritive or harmful ( mostly hearing this from the paleo diet crowd ) .i was wondering if you could shed some light on what the current understanding is on that topic , or if you could point me in the direction of where i could learn more . thanks ! for some context , please check out my associated blog post dietary guideline graphics : from the food pyramid to myplate , harvard ’ s healthy eating plate , and pcrm ’ s power plate ! dr gif you were forced against the wall with an assailant armed with a chicken drumstick and he demanded an answer to the following question , what would you say ?

or is there a clever way to combine plant proteins to be as , or even more effective than meat proteins ? totally confused … . michelletaikozfan : from her own words , your previous dietician is not up to date on even basic nutrition information . a great deal of what was written to you is simply wrong , including her understanding or expression of what children need . because of that , i think you are better off without her / him . rather than explain all the ways that she is wrong , i ’ ll stick to the positive . the good news is that there are great resources for helping you lose weight in the most healthy and safe way possible – the whole plant food way.because your questions are specifically about protein , i ’ ll start by giving you my favorite protein reference information . if you work your way through these articles , you will be greatly relieved concerning your protein worries . for the first link , there is a section on the page that talks about the myth of the need to worry about protein combining . but i recommend going through the whole article. http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmlthen , to fill in more details , check out dr. mcdougall ’ s article from december 2003. http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / newsletter / archives / you might also check out the january 2004 newsletter article , protein overload.next are some resources that provide the conceptual information you need in order to know how to lose weight . the first is a free lecture on you tube from doug lisle , ph.d. called , how to lose weight without losing your mind https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ?

i find that the ratio of fibre to protein in a vegan diet a bit ‘ taxing ’ and voluminous. and i am concerned about too much soy protein in the diet. i seem to be ok with gluten , but it must be cooked , adding raw gluten to my breakfast cereal mix does not seem to be a good idea. any suggestions ? hi there ! i remember when i first started on my plant-based journey and was very concerned about my protein intake . prior to being vegan / whole food plant-based ( wfpb ) i was a chicken breast guzzling , 6 day a week in the gym guy obsessed with building muscle . i now feel great and build muscle without even worrying about my protein intake . sometimes we can get so caught up in the grams , percentages and cm ’ s that we lose sight of the quality of our food . i ’ m not saying this is you , i am just sharing from personal experience.i think it is great you are taking steps in a more vegan direction . my journey was step by step . i began a vegetarian that still consumed dairy , fish and eggs . then , i only consumed eggs and dairy , then dairy , and eventually i was a full vegan . i would say this process took me about 4 years because i had to feel comfortable with the food i was eating and how i was preparing it . this site is one of my favorites for some great plant-based recipes . you can also check out forks over knives for some great recipes as well . while on the subject of cooking , i wouldn ’ t be too concerned with soy as long as you are sticking to 3-5 servings a day.since i am not sure what your workout routine looks like exactly i cannot estimate the rate in which you would gain lean muscle mass . just remember that when you workout you are actually destroying muscle fiber in order build it back bigger and stronger when you recover . i know plant-based foods can be filling due to their fiber , but this natural pairing creates a wonderful synergistic health effect in order to rid your body of toxins that were produced during the workout while at the same time building your muscle better than it was before . i highly recommend this article on where vegetarians get their protein from. it gives great insight on how much protein we actually need . i will also point out that on occasion i use an organic plant-based protein powder when i am in a hurry , but i mainly add whole foods to my meals , like hemp seeds to my oat meal and smoothies , to give a little more nutrient density.i wish you health and happiness my friend . i hope this information helps ! : - ) james : really great post ! it was nice of you to spend so much time sharing both your story and giving ideas for healthy eating . i also like the websites you listed for recipe ideas.i wanted to share with both you and ptrjnf my favorite sources for understanding protein needs . after working my way through these two articles , i had such a better understanding of how to get protein needs covered . it takes away all the fear and myths regarding protein : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.html http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / newsletter / archives / ( check out december 2003 for mcdougall ’ s site , “ a brief history of protein : passion , social bigotry , rats , and enlightenment ” . also april 2007 , “ when friends ask : where do you get your protein ? ” ) that information combined with personal experiences like james ’ can be a great help to people like ptrjnf trying to transition.hello , i came across this website that claims that chocho , an ecuadorian legume , has higher protein content than soy and doesn ´ t contain phytoestrogens ! is this true ? i ´ ve done some research and just found a couple of articles that say the same thing. http : / / chocho.planeta.ec / kenny : i don ’ t know if it is true or not , but let ’ s suppose for a minute that both points are true : 1 ) chocho has more protein than soy , 2 ) choco does not have phytoestrogens . neither point makes chocho a better choice than soy.in other words , we don ’ t need more protein than we get from normal everyday plants that we already consume . this website explains why if you are interested : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmland we don ’ t need to avoid phytoestrogens . in fact , phytoestrogens appear to be good for us on a variety of fronts ( including breast cancer patients ) . http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ?

PLAIN-3130	are avocados bad for you ? published just last year , an in vitro evaluation of the genotoxicity of avocado fruit in human white blood cells . this study was not funded by the avocado commission ; maybe its big salsa trying to muscle in on the guac market.a simple experiment . they took normal human cells . and the easiest way to get human cells is to just take a blood sample . it 's kind of the easy way out — that 's what i did for my research work at cornell.then they took some avocado fruit , smooshed it up , dripped a tiny bit on some healthy human white blood cells , and looked to see if they could detect any dna damage . it was not subtle . this is what normal healthy human chromosomes look like . this is your dna ; this is dna on guacamole . chromosomes literally broken in half , terminal deletions , dysjunctions , translocation , all sorts of weird chromosomal abnormalities . this is the kind of thing carcinogens do.conclusion : their study suggests that extracts of avocado fruit can potentially induce significant genomic instability and some genetic damage in human white blood cells.why do they say potentially — we could see it with our own eyes . because it was an in vitro evaluation . these were human cells , but they were outside the body . even people that love guacamole don ’ t shoot it up like heroin , you eat it . so before it can affect our blood cells it hits stomach acid . then digestive enzymes . then our liver is a carcinogen detoxifying machine ! and only then , do food compounds get to circulate throughout our body.so , we don ’ t know what happens when when we eat it , but if the same effect occurs on body cells in vivo , meaning inside the body , then it could result in loss of function , cell death or transformation into cancer . and if it did the same thing to our sperm or eggs , it could lead to infertility , abortions , miscarriages , or birth defects.the bottom line we don ’ t know what avocado consumption can do inside the body , but until the jury is in , i think it ’ s reasonable , given these new data , for people to consider reducing their intake . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check out are avocados good for you ? also , there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos – please feel free to explore them ! it seems odd to me that they would include avocado leaves with the fruit . perhaps that threw off their findings . i ’ ve never even seen an avocado leaf , much less put them in my guacamole ! they did separate experiments and found similar findings with both leaves and just the fruit alone , unfortunately.i think i ’ ll just go with your insight that digestion may make this a moot issue and keep eating avocado . thx.how common are “ in vitro ” studies like this ? is it fairly common ? and if so , do you know of any other food which has caused such stunning genetic disruption ? michael greger : ” and then they took some avocado fruits , mashed it up ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 20859823 “ concentrations of 50 % methanolic extracts of persea americana fruit and leaves ” and what was the concentration of the extract ? “ the mean percentage total aberrant metaphases at 100 mg / kg , 200 mg / kg , and 300 mg / kg concentrations of leaf extract ” is this the typical concentration we find in a fruit ? no , it is not ! michael greger : “ they did separate experiments and found similar findings with both leaves and just the fruit alone , unfortunately ” indeed , but the fruit extract at doses of 100 mg / kg , 200 mg / kg , and 300 mg / kg produced less genotoxicity : ” the group exposed to leaf extract showed higher frequency of all types of aberrations at equal concentrations as compared to the group exposed to fruit extract ” it is the fruit that we eat and this does not contain the extracts / concentrations used in this study . what is the concentration of the so called dangerous persin in an avocado ? plant food we eat on daily basis contains a myriad of toxins . if you concentrate them and do the exact in vitro test , there would be nothing left to eat … except for meat … louis asks : “ is this the typical concentration we find in a fruit ? ” reproduced from the cited article ( snipping out only relevant details on the avocado fruit preparation ) : “ fruits of persea americana were collected … shade-dried at room temperature … fruit pulp was macerated with 50 % methanol and extracted once with 300 ml of 50 % methanol at room temperature for one week with occasional shaking … methanolic extracts of fruit … [ were ] concentrated to dryness at 60 ± 1 ° c in a rotary evaporator … fruit extract after concentration gave a light-brown , oily , viscous extract … crude extracts were used for further study as solutions / suspensions in double distilled water after removing the particulate matter by centrifugation and sterilization using syringe filters … blood cultures were set up with three different concentrations ( 100 , 200 , and 300 mg / kg culture medium ) [ of ] fruit extracts ” please note : the unit of measure is milligrams of dried extract per kilogram of “ culture medium ” my interpretation : the methodology presented in the cited article provides no basis to infer that the so-called dangerous persin was actually concentrated … since the methanolic extracts were expressed in arbitrary units ( with no relation to concentration of toxins specified ) , it could be that the persin was 1 billion times more concentrated than the normal state after eating avocado or 1 billion times less concentrated than normal or even equivalent to normal . we simply don ’ t know ! conclusion : this is bad science and meaningless from the point of view of making health-related choices ! i agree with this conclusion . this study also shows ( or rather , ignores ) that whole foods mostly act differently than their separated individual parts.i agree with this . the study and this article are totally bogus . i am beginning to see a trend in dr. greger ’ s articles.bias. ‘ you can ’ t poison a goat ’ refers to the way goats tend to eat a wide range of things rather than having a large amount of one thing , toxins in small amounts can be tonici gave up meat , foul , fish , eggs , cheese , milk , sugar and white flour . i ’ m not giving up avocado ! how were the extracts made ? some solvents used for extractions are toxic by themselves … there is a big difference between dumping something directly onto cells as opposed to having something ( esp. something non extracted ) digested before food fragments come into contact with immune or any other kind of cells.as somebody remarked above , it is curious that leaves were also extracted . why did they study this at all , do food companies include leaves in their products ? were the used avocados raised ‘ conventionally ’ which may explain some of the pesticides found ? my question is : does the “ fruit ” of the avocado in this study include the meat plus peel , or just the meat ? if the peel was included , then this is an unnecessary scare story , as we do not eat the peel . as mentioned , these in vitro assays are not reliable enough to reject a fruit that is such an important source of vitamin e and essential fatty acids – not to mention delicious ! they just used the fruit pulp ( no peel or pit ) .this is very disheartening . avocado has been touted ( in some of your videos , i believe ? — not sure ) as a superfood . how does a person reconcile all the conflicting info ? i love this site and the invaluable info it provides , but it gets difficult knowing how to contextualize all the tidbits from isolated tests – often conflicting and / or focusing on different aspects of health – into an overall approach to eating . clues ? bringing together all the studies into workable “ models ” or beliefs can be challenging . scientists wrestle with this problem as well . some shifts are easy such as the journey many have gone through from “ dairy milk does the body good ” to “ dairy milk doesn ’ t do the body good ” to “ dairy milk does the body harm ” to “ dairy milk contains toxins ” . once on a essentially whole plant based diet with b12 supplementation the confusion is still there but you have made tremendous strides . for me i use moderation as the keystone when studies like the one cited here come out . you have to decide . keep tuned however as the science keeps changing.plants protect themselves with toxins , don ’ t eat too much of any one kind , and you can probably mitigate one class of toxins , lectins , by eating chicken skin to provide sacrificial glucosamine for the lectins to bind to , for many years , i used four pounds of organically grown avocados daily , all year round , many varieties , purchased in 40 pound boxes direct from the farmer in san diego county , southern california . eventually , whenever i ate avocados , twitching occurred in my fingers and sometimes my forearms , not much , but enough to scare me . the farmer ’ s widow , after the framer died , said that the farmer died of parkinson ’ s disease , & she also said that another avocado farmer had also died of parkinson ’ s disease . i ’ ve tried many times to resume eating avocados , but , after a short time , frequently the same day after just one avocado , the same twitching symptoms recurred . i ’ ve read that animals , such as goats , are poisoned by eating avocado leaves or pits . i ate only the pulp , always organically grown avocados . perhaps the persin destroys some brain cells when excessive quantities are consumed , & over long periods of time , the damage becomes noticeable . in my opinion , all foods are potentially damaging in various ways so a varied diet is necessary , usually . balance of nutrients & freshness are essential . thank you.hi daysleeper , i ’ m sorry to hear about your bad experience with avocado … clearly this fruit is not for you ! i was a bit confused by your hypothesis on what causes the symptoms . your symptoms seem to occur “ after a short time ” and yet your hypothesis that “ persin destroys some brain cells when excessive quantities are consumed ” is , as noted by you , a process that would occur “ over long periods of time ” . i was confused by the mismatch of the time-scales for your symptoms and explanatory process.have you considered an alternate hypothesis that you are having an alegergic reaction to avocado . there is data to support this possibility … the following link provides details : http : / / foodallergens.ifr.ac.uk / food.lasso ? selected _ food = 4 you did not read closely enough . he said that he consumed 4 pounds of avocado daily for many years … .and after he first started noticing symptoms , only 1 avocado in a day would quickly bring back the symptoms.good point . i now realize that i failed to notice the extreme consumption.it is unfortunate that the researchers who performed this study did not measure the concentration of persin in the avocado fruit extract that they prepared . in the article , so many arguments are given about deleterious effects of persin and yet the researchers never report the actual concentration of persin in the culture ! as the researchers reported in the discussion section : “ there is also a possibility of certain component / components causing the genotoxicity being scanty or absent in the fruit while being present in higher amounts in the leaves . this can only be resolved by isolation and characterization of the active constituents responsible for the observed genotoxicity . ” it remains to be proven that avocado is harmful to humans . the present paper , though provocative , presents a weak argument for rejecting avocado consumption ! thanks for the info . glad to see that most viewers are able to put this study in perspective . many phytochemicals in fruit an vegetables are undoubtedly toxic when studied in isolation . this type of reductionist science is interesting but not very helpful in my opinion . i will continue to eat avocados in moderation as a small part of a diverse whole food plant based diet.as someone who has eaten at least an average of 1 avocado per day for many years , i think a petri dish study is alarmist at best , and the good doctors who throw this at the public without good human studies are not doing anyone a favor . the gentleman who ate 4 # per day could have had a lymphatic flow impairment , a b6 deficiency , or a gall bladder issue . the persin is probably neutralized in the intestinal tract in most healthy individuals is my guess as to why the world has not been destroyed by the millions of pounds of avocadoes consumed.thanks for the info mg and for reminding us about in vitro vs invivo .. i ’ d like to know what the results are if they do the same ( in vitro ) to the top 100 most common foods … and classify the results from 0 ( no damage ) to low , medium , high , and compare where those foods effects are versus of avocado . i assume it ’ s not * common * for this to happen when you do this in vitro and put food on the cells … but is it unheard of ? or are there foods where similar things have been seen , and , those foods are ( nevertheless ) from epidemiological studies seem not to dangerous after all.i mean if even just one single other food does this * and * that other food from population studies seems harmless after all , then that suggests that the in vivo is maybe more benign ( but does not prove it , after all it could be that avocado digestion does not save the day but digestion of that other food does ) another idea / question – population studies directly comparing avocado consumption with effects years alter either in disease , or give people a blodo test years later and see if they can detect problems in the blood ( or dna found elsewhere ) seems to me like either of the above could give us additional clues making avocado consumption ( in moderation ) seem either more “ guilty ” or less “ guilty ” depending on the results.i had 3 / 4 of a hass avocado this evening and reacted to it . i don ; ’ t always react , but often enough to decide there is something wrong . my search identified persin as the toxin . i wonder if the thin-skin varieties of avocado might have much less toxin in them . any thoughts on this ? any updates on avacadoes in vivo ? i ’ m happy to report that a new study this year found avocado consumption associated with significantly reduced prostate cancer risk ( a third cup of avocado a day or more associated with 60 % decreased odds of prostate cancer compared to men eating less than a daily tablespoon ) . holy guacamole ! a year later the same authors wrote : avocado fruit ( persea americana mill ) exhibits chemo-protective potentiality against cyclophosphamide induced genotoxicity in human lymphocyte culture. that concluded : these studies suggest that phytochemicals from the avocado fruit can be utilized for making active chemoprotective ingredient for lowering the side effect of chemotherapy like cyclophosphamide in cancer therapy.dr. greger , i discovered your videos on you-tube about a week ago and have been watching them as well as exploring your website here . most of what i have been hearing has been very interesting and informative however when i hear studies like this it makes me a little crazy – i don ’ t know how to evaluate it . you read it in the same straight voice you use in all your other videos , and the source and nature of the study has no really differentiation from any of the other videos , but i do not know how serious to take the procedure used in this study ? would one not get the same kind of results dripping water on blood cells … they would explode or implode wouldn ’ t they ? or virtually any other liquid no matter how benign it seems to us on the macro level it seems like would cause a problem if dripped on blood cells directly.is this a recognized and validated method of research ? as i have been moving towards veganism for a little over a month now it is difficult to think that i have to start calling some fruits and vegetables friends and others enemies because of things like this . i am tempted by what i think is my better judgement to just ignore studies like this … but then again my bad judgement in eating the average american diet for over 40 years makes my own judgement a little suspect ! what am i supposed to make of this please ? if you look under the “ doctor ’ s note ” above , there is an update posted , which should help put your mind at ease ( certainly did for me ! ) .i was more concerned with the whole methodology of this study and then others that are cited where they drip juice on cells and things like that . thanks for the reply , i appreciate what you are doing here , and in such a fact-baed and entertaining style as well ! has there ever been a study of the affects of persin ( amounts typically found in a serving of avocado ) on the human body when digested by humans ? it seems this study doesn ’ t give us the full picture of how persin affects the body after it is digested , frankly it scares people . your follow-up is comforting , however still leaves a cliffhanger as to whether it ’ s better to consume or avoid avocado ’ s ! who funded the avocado study and it ’ s affects on our blood ? could it have been the meat industry trying to scare vegans and the like ? do you consume avocado and if so in what quantity ? thanks dr. greger , excellent site and presentation of the information.dr. esselstyn , one of the few doctors out there successfully treating heart disease without surgery , says oils are very bad for the heart. check out what he says about oils in this interview : http : / / www.heartattackproof.com / qanda.htmi ’ ve personally spoken with him on the telephone and he says that avocado oil is the same as olive oil and other oils which are very bad for the heart . he says that they play a role in causing arteriosclerosis which leads to heart attacks . in his book “ how to prevent and reverse heart disease ” i think he specifically says to stay away from avocados and he says that the lower incidence of heat disease and heart attacks among the people who digest olive oil and avocados is a mirage . he says that while those people do have lower rates of heart disease and heart attacks than the people who eat the western diet , they still have higher rates of heart disease and heart attacks than the people who stick to a plant-based diet and also stay away from olive oil and avocado oil . he says the people with the lowest rates of heart disease / heart attacks are the people who eat a plant-based diet except for the plants with oils . he adds that the people who eat a plant-based diet including the plant food that have oils ( avocados and olives ) have lower rates of heart disease and heart attacks than the people who have a meat-based diet but they could lower their heart disease / heart attack rates even more if they stopped eating olive oil , avocado oil , and other plant based food with oil.people have their different sources they believe , but what make dr. esselstyn ’ s word gospel , and isn ’ t it most likely that no one has all the answers as well as realizing people ’ s message do not just freeze , they evolve and hopefully get smarter . a freezing message is an example of a product sold for a profit , and low and behold we see esselstyn ’ s name on supermarket products now . how can i be sure that any time i see his name it ’ s not just some guerilla marketing … that that guerilla marketing is always bad , but convincing people of things in order to sell them things is a pretty big racket . > he says the people with the lowest rates of heart disease / heart attacks are the people who eat a plant-based diet except for the plants with oils.this sounds like something that makes sense , but i really doubt there is enough obejctive data to prove that because there are so many variables and and reporting them is often just subjective.brux , either the evidence backs esselstyn up or it doesn ’ t . that ’ s what it gets down to.does esselstyn make a profit off of his ideas ? i think he does . is esslestyn allowed to make a profit off of his position ? of course . it ’ s still a capitalistic world . if you came up with an idea of how to cure a disease that lots of people have and is killing lots of people i bet you would give it away for free and not try to make one penny in the process . right ! ! ! ! ! the thing is that they did studies that show that the mediterranean diet is way better than the american diet but there are other studies that show that the mediterranean diet can be improved . even better results can be achieved.in his book esselstyn talks about how some sections of the asian population were not seeing any hear attacks or heart disease . the people living on a plant based diet even avoiding the oils were free of heart disease and free from heart attacks . then western culture started encroaching into hose populations and all of a sudden they are seeing heart disease and heart attacks . the older generations in those sections of the asian population are still seeing little or no heart problems because they live by the old ways and the old diets and the younger generations ridicule the older people in those parts of asia calling them jungle people and the like . but the older people eating a plant based diet and staying away from oils are still staying free of heart disease and heart attacks while the younger generation that is more and more adopting western culture is seeing more and more heart problems.i ’ ve heard the evidence , and seen videos from essylstyn and others , as well as the summaries of studies here . i think there is room for disagreement , and no one has real proof . yes , there is data to support essylstyn ’ s hypotheses , but they do not know what all is going on here . i am working on keeping vegan , but i don ’ t want to be a fanatic about anything – no one understands this completely , so while i eat mostly veggies , i will occasionally eat oil , or cheese , meat or dairy , i just try to keep it way down . one of the most interesting videos i ’ ve seen is the one about intestinal flora and how it reacts to meat . everything now has chemicals in it , pesticides , antibiotics , metals … it is disgusting how we have treated the planet and industrialized our food supply . i think organic , fresh and vegetarian mostly is a good way to be … past that , i don ’ t know for sure and i am not sure i buy essylstyn ’ s views , logical as they sound.even though i use olive oil , i suspect oils ( not whole foods ) are iffy … but whole foods ? he makes a stronger claim that whole foods ( avocados , in moderation for example ) are bad , ok , please post some links , or just one link , to a study that did the comparison . ( personally i have about 10 + blood readings of my trigl. levels , about 7 before , when i had a super low fat vegan diet , and about 3 after … my readings got much better , lower , after i made the change to moderate-low from super-low fat vegan diet ) and even if there was 100 studies showing better heart health for super low fat versus medium-low fat vegan whole-foods diet , that ’ s still not the end , because heart health isn ’ t the only component of health … and for other components of health the results might be the opposite .. but even for the narrow question of heart health , i have read or skimmed all this exchange and still not seen a link to a study peer reviewed , double blind etc , comparing the two . ( then i ’ d like to see greger ’ s analysis of such study / studies ) a lot of the media stuff we see are linear extrapolations from some fact that someone digs out data mining some big study . i just do not think we know the perfect answers to these questions , and like you said heart health is not everything . i wish i could stick to a strict vegan diet , and i do try for the most part , but it ’ s just almost impossible . i feel i know the general parameters , and low fat , and especially as little animal fat as possible is better … but i am not sure some , such as fish oil is not good for you . to define rules based on who shouts the loudest of give the best video talk doesn ’ t make sense to be me . i just try to keep taking in information , it could be hundreds of years before we really understand everything – if we , human beings , are still here.i don ’ t think we will ever understand everything . colin campbell ’ s recent book , whole , discusses the limitations of reductionistic approaches to understanding complex systems . they are useful but the limitations must be understood . i also believe most people would benefit from a better understanding of statistics and risk / benefit . it does boil down to biochemistry . given our current food environment sticking to a plant based diet is a challenge . current studies don ’ t show any value in consuming fish oil . it is a journey … stay tuned as the science keeps coming.reductionistic , ie linear modeling only works in certain situations , and is usually good to demonstrate the effects a certain variable has one a complex system , not as a way to measure , quantify or control that system . somehow we have allowed all life in western civilization to be reduced to this industrial machine input and output … well , that is , except if you are rich enough to be able to escape that system and rise above it . but then … what ’ s western about that the way that system , our system , is now ? just to clarify , when i said ” i made the change to moderate-low from super-low fat vegan diet ” i meant “ change to moderate-low vegan from super-low fat vegan .. ” just adding more nuts , adding some avocado , and wise or unwise , adding more olive oil … lower triglyc , was strongly correlated with this diet change.i don ’ t use fish or other animal products but as greger put so well in a cooking video he did a long time ago , don ’ t guilt trip yourself , if you can be 90 % or x % vegan , you ’ re still doing a huge amount for your health , for the environment , and for the animals.i personally think dairy is more iffy than fish , but if you ’ re using fish , i ’ d research real carefully about heavy metals , then i ’ d research if there are any other chemicals , or hormones , then i ’ d reserach it is gmo fish , and if officially not , is it near another population that is that in 5 years they ’ ll tell you “ oops , there was gmo contamination with fish interbreeding ” as we know happens with plants , etc , just more to worry about to avoid , and research “ if you want others to be happy , practice compassion . if you want to be happy , practice compassion ” -the dalai lamai think you are seeing products connected with dr. esselstyn ’ s son , rip . > see also yesterday ’ s “ prequel ” are avocados good for you ? and today it is “ are avocados bad for you ” … at least there is somewhere in the media where the fairness doctrine still applies ! if avocados are bad , or contain substances that are toxic or carcinogenic , doesn ’ t that mean that virtually everything does to some extent ? are we supposed to somehow classify all plants as to whether they are above some good v. bad level and only eat certain fruits and vegetables ? i never used to eat many avocados … usually only in guacamole , or on turkey sandwiches , but since i started to eat more vegan fair i buy avocados pretty regularly , sometimes eating them for breakfast , or on a veggie burger sandwich.since so many plants have so many different chemicals , and the body can never guess what chemicals plants will evolve , isn ’ t it reasonable to hypothesize that the human body has some mechanism to filter out or ignore most of these insecticide and fungicidal compounds ? is science crazy or are we on the step of a new understanding of how the human body and nutrition work ? tiny problem : were the avocados in question ripe ? unripe avocado is what the vast majority of people ( including scientists ) consider ripe when it ’ s not . a ripe avocado is soft , something like spreadable cheese . ripe avocado are chemically different from unripe ones as it happens with most fruit . usually unripe fruit contain toxic chemicals not present or much less present in ripe fruit.thank you.i think this is very , very important ! i bet the persin is the reason it is toxic to all animals except humans . i am so curious why that is.considering how destructive it is ( given the video above ) , if our digestive system didn ’ t neutralize the persin , i ’ m sure we would have the same reactions as other animals ( diarrhea , death , or death by diarrhea ! ) what about avocado oil on the skin ? seems to be a popular ingredient in many natural products . since an external application is similar to data mentioned in the above video , could it cause the same dna damage ? i can only hope that this ridiculous report is not being passed off as “ scientific ” . i won ’ t harp on the lack of cause and effect scenarios , proper scientific procedure to test a hypothesis and so on . a first year grad student wouldn ’ t be allowed to publish this tripe , assuming such a poorly designed project even got approval.as an aside , i will advise my dna not to expose itself to anything while residing in a test tube without first obtaining my permission.hi dr greger , have you got any input on premature infertility and diet ? yan yee , i ’ m not sure about premature infertility , but dr. greger does have a video on the relationship between hormones found in meat and female infertility : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / meat-hormones-female-infertility / and male infertility : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / male-fertility-and-diet / . hope that helps ! : ) hi ! i can ’ t find anything online thats consistent about testing and effects or treatment about candidiasis . would be greatly interested in your findings ! thanks for all you do ! a very engaging discussion on avocados . i am a loyal subscriber to the site and have been reading this avocado debate with enthusiasm . in reading all of the valuable and thoughtful input from past input , one comment jumped out at me . gio made the point that properly ripened avocado is quite different in chemical structure than the partially ripened fruit . this is true for any plant product as an enormous part of the maturation process takes is responsible for changing the basic chemical structure of the end product . personally , i followed a somewhat typical western diet for most of my life , making a few attempts at a vegetarian or vegan diet several times in the past ; however , travelling significantly in my work , i found the lifestyle virtually impossible . now , being faced with a very high psa level , i have devoted to a nearly vegan lifestyle , having sworn off of all dairy , sugars , animal proteins ( with very limited and infrequent exceptions of fish ) . i seldom cook vegetables other than the obvious , such as dried beans . the avocado toxicity paradox has me reeling and not knowing how to take these conflicting study results . i am ; however , quite relieved and pleased by the positive avocado / prostate health study results . the individual who consumed pounds of the fruit daily , it seems to me , was begging for overreaction , simply by overindulgence . in my present diet , the few portions of any fat that i receive , i receive from avocado , nuts and olive oil . we know that fats are essential for brain function and development and goodness knows , i need all the brain function that i can get . my diet of the past two years is composed mainly of varied raw cruciferous vegetables , small but frequent asparagus portions , beans , raw spinach and nuts with olive oil and one avocado daily , all organic when possible . being raised on a cattle and rice farm , this would seem to be a major departure ; however , it is a departure in diet only . i question if any studies have been conducted on populations that have consumed high portions of avocados in their traditional geography and culture . these folks would be excellent subjects , rather than studies based upon westerners who have tainted their dna , traditions , dietary makeup and general chemistry with the toxins , additives , gmos and impurities that they have encountered in our typical environment . any word or opinion on this would be welcomed.doug : nice post ! i like your analysis.i ’ m afraid i don ’ t have much to add to your discussion . ( hopefully others will jump in . ) but i wanted to say that i also appreciate a good avocado ! also , i ’ m curious if your diet changes have helped your psa levels . or is it too early to tell ? i ’ ll think good thoughts for you.finally , i wanted to say : there are plenty of people who would rather die than change their diet . so , it means something significant that you were able to make this change that was difficult for your . congratulations . i hope it leads to a long healthy life . best of luck.hi dr. greger , this video is now has now prompted me to write you , i really hope you can find the time to respond … for years i ’ ve been trying to live by a plant based diet , but failed several times . as a runner i need good protein to recover and keep a healthy weight . on plant sources alone i simply lose too much weight ( dropping to 130 ) . as it is with chicken 2-3 times a week and avocados ( walnuts too for the fats ) . im 140 at 6 ’ 2 . i was recently determined to be slightly anemic and my doctor also wants me to gain weight saying i have too low bmi . main sources of many meals is oat meal , berries , walnuts ( breakfast ) and beans ( black , red , kidney , pinto , lentils , pearly barley ) , perhaps black beans and a vegetable at lunch and lentils at dinner . my doctor has also warned me about the high level of oxalates with my diet and the risk of kidney stones . perhaps the oxalates also caused the anemia to begin with ? so i kindly ask of you could you point me in the right direction ? perhaps a sample weekly meal plan you follow ? is eating 3 times a day ok or should i be eating more frequently ? please this would be greatly appreciated . thank you for reading and thank you for your time.joe.joe : i hope dr. greger is able to respond to you , but i know that he rarely has the time now a days to respond to indvidual people . so , i thought i would reply in case i can help . i ’ m not a doctor or an expert , but i have some ideas that relate to your situation.there is a frequent commenter on nutritionfact named “ veganrunner ” . i ’ m hoping she will see your post and comment . but if not , maybe you could find one of her posts and ask her how she thrives on a plant based diet while being a serious runner.one of my favorite reference books is the revised express edition of a book called “ becoming vegan ” by brenda davis and vesanto melina . based on past posts , i know that dr. greger also has a lot of respect for brenda davis . i think he would approve of my recommendation that you get the book one way or another so that you can read the chapter on gaining weight . it is really excellent and will tell you how to gain or maintain your weight in a healthy way . the book includes meal plan examples for various calorie levels.another idea is to look for some of the vegan athlete websites out there . i know that there is at least one that feature vegan athletes in general and another one that focuses on vegan body builders . you could gain information from those sites and might be able to ask questions . similarly , i believe that there are some good vegan athlete books out there which also include meal plans.dr. greger has some videos and articles about kidney stones and oxalates that might make you feel better : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / what-is-the-best-diet-for-kidney-stone-prevention / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / oxalic-acid-in-beets / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / oxalates-in-cinnamon / i ’ m no expert , but based on what you describe , your diet sounds pretty on track ! – minus the chicken . ( 2 to 3 times a week. yikes ! ) if you have time to look around on this site , you will see how great berries , walnuts and beans are for you . i ’ m thinking that it will just take some tweaking of your diet to meet your needs . assuming no underlying medical condition , if you are losing weight , you are not eating enough . as you can see in brenda ’ s book , there are some pretty easy ways to fix that.i think it is really great that you are trying to be as healthy as you can . i wish you luck on your journey and hope this post ends up helping you.don ’ t avoid avocados . these scientists get bored and do these nonsense studies to confuse folks . greger even says “ we don ’ t know what happens when we eat avocados ” this petrie dish stuff is a waste of time – much like studies on rats – we are humans , not rats ! i find it so hard to believe that a food from nature can be bad for our health . misinformation is bad for our health.this is truly weird science and of zero practical use . why not study people in southern california or mexico who actually eat avocados and salsa virtually every day of their lives versus dripping avocado extract onto human cells in a petri dish . this is perfect example of how to waste money on weird research.aww shucks just bought avocado fruits last week and i still have 3 more to go … .those of us that raise chickens know that all parts of avocados are toxic to them . perhaps it is the same toxin that affects them , but to a greater extent . i think this is a great example of “ everything in moderation ! ” and we should strive for variety in our primarily plant-based diets or whatever diet we consume.can avocado seeds really be so wonderful ? http : / / www.realfarmacy.com / avocado-seeds-superfoods-health / thanks ! i wonder if avocado is a choice for someone with liver disease per the reference to it detoxifying role in the avocado . does the generous doctor have an opinion ? hi linda . i did not see anything on liver disease , but this in vitro study looked at esophageal squamous carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cell lines and avocado fruit extracts . important to note this is far different from eating whole avocados as dr. greger mentions in both avocado videos.is this information valid : home » health » health tips » avocado seeds – super food for super healthavocado seeds – super food for super healthadmin april 4 , 2015 avocado seeds – super food for super health2015-04-05t03 : 37 : 27 + 00 : 00 health , health tipsno commentsharethe avocado is also known as a super food that can give our bodies some of the healthiest nutrients . worldwide , the avocado is considered to have the most soluble fibers.eating one avocado provides our body with the entire daily needed fiber dose . compared with other vegetables and fruits , it contains various types of antioxidants.the benefits of consuming the avocado seedone astonishing thing is that the skin and the flesh of the avocado contain only 30 % of the antioxidants and 70 % of them are present in the seed.these antioxidants lower the cholesterol and prevent different kinds of diseases especially heart diseases . they also reduce inflammatory diseases and calm soreness in gastrointestinal tract.since the avocado is rich in fibers it can prevent constipation and ease diarrhea . phenolic compound is an antioxidant present in the seed itself.it helps relieve gastric ulcer pain which is caused by antibacterial and sometimes anti-viral properties.looking for more reasons why you should eat avocado ? another important antioxidant known as flavonol is also contained in the seed . this antioxidant can help in fighting cancer . so , avocado seed is the perfect food for people suffering from cancer since they are adviced to eat foods rich in flavonol.if you have a weak immune system and often get colds during the flu season , including avocado seeds in your diet is the perfect solution for you . consuming avocado seed will help you strengthen your immune system.the fundamental reasons why people get sick , get cancer and get older rapidly are the free radicals . the avocado seed can help you in preventing all of these by fighting free radicals . having the ability to build up the collagen below the skin , it can help you get a young and fresh look.and that ’ s not all you get from avocado ! it will make you become more active by cutting down body aches , joint pains and bone diseases.losing weight and lowering blood glucose level are another two benefits you get from consuming avocado . it can help with exercise-induced asthma and if you feel food cravings it will make you feel fuller.how to extract the avocado seedif the avocado is ripe it will open easily . just take a knife and cut it vertically from both sides . when you have taken out the seed you can make a smoothie : put it in a plastic bag and smash it with a hammer . then put it in a blender along with other ingredients like spinach , bananas dates etc.if you have a more powerful blender , put the avocado seed with the other ingredients without crushing it before . don ’ t forget to add some water . after the preparation make sure you enjoy drinking it ! source : http : / / www.dailynutritionnews.comahm sir can i ask ?

PLAIN-3140	stool size matters the bigger our bowel movements , the healthier we may be . the risk of low stool weight includes bowel cancer , diverticular disease , appendicitis , various anal diseases — even perhaps , the healthfulness of breast tissue.from a study of 23 populations across dozen countries , a graph , of average daily stool weight versus colon cancer incidence . as you can see , once you get down around 200 grams , colon cancer rates really seem to skyrocket . that 's about half a pound . and once people start dropping quarter pounders , though , colon cancer incidence doubles.the link between stool size and colon cancer may be related to transit time , the number of hours it takes for food to go from your mouth to anus . the larger your stool , the quicker the transit time , the easier it is for your intestines to move things along.people don ’ t realize , though , you can have daily bowl movements and still be effectively constipated . you can be regular , but five days late.what you ’ re seeing today you may have eaten last week . if you want to test it for yourself , you can eat a big bowl of beets and see when things turns pretty in pink . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check out the other videos on bowel movements . also , there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos – please feel free to explore them ! hi dr greger . i so value the research and info you impart . i am 74 ( f ) and have been told that i need not have any more colonoscopies . i have spastic colon and an abundance of diverticula in spite of being a vegetarian , now vegan , for 32 years . my mother died of colon cancer . therefore , i have been diligent about getting regular exams . lately i am not forming full stools in spite of the high fiber diet . i have ordered some bowel treatment items from dr. schultze ’ s site . i am afraid not to have the colonoscopies . what would you suggest to a patient presenting as i am ? thank you very much . lynnlast summer i read a pdf book by a buddhist monk discussing vegetarianism . contrary to popular belief , buddhism does not mandate vegetarianism for either monks or lay people . the monk who authored this book eventually decided to go vegetarian . he explained that one of the reasons why he delayed this decision was that he was turned off by a fetish that some sectors of the veg * n community has for discussing their inner workings like bowel movements , digestion , etc . he warned readers that these things could turn other people away from vegetarianism.i have read that there are some risks with larger bowel movements , primarily poor nutrient retention due to increased size and frequency . is it reasonable too assume there could be a risk with a diet to high in fiber that does not permit for optimal nutrient absorption ? my guess is that that risk would be more due to inadequate hydration , which it never hurts to bring awareness back to . excuse me while i grab some water … the suggested home experiment of consuming a bowl of beets and estimating transit time sounded like an excellent way to do simple self-diagnosis . a clever and straightforward home health check-up ! i hope to hear more tips like this in future.i think transit time is a relatively old tool-of-the-trade for naturopaths . i first heard of it in the early 70s via a marin , california naturopath but i don ’ t know , it may have been used for centuries . it ’ s easy to check in any case so the connection must have been recognized quickly by the first beet eaters though they might have panicked at first thinking it was blood.who knew that eating fruits and vegetables would cause one to drop whoppers.a good probiotic is also helpful in this regard , though not to “ make up for ” a trashy diet . a “ good probiotic ” is an operational definition : one that works for you . since you may discover more than one that works well , over time i would rotate between those types and brands you find that work rather than getting the same one each time you buy a bottle.another thing that is even more than helpful , it ’ s essential ( learned from an indian yoga teacher ) , is squatting for elimination . can you argue with 100 % natural ? essential but not sufficient of course . diet seems to be # 1 . at an extreme , the former roy walford md , longevity maven ( calorie restriction studies ) opined that the [ best diet + no exercise ] would be better than the [ worst diet + good exercise ] .i do not have large bowel movements but rather many small bowel movements throughout the day . i eat a lot of fiber , especially raw vegetables . please comment . susanplease also check out my associated blog post , stool size and breast cancer risk ! hi , i have an anal fissure that is almost healed ( 6 months now ) . it is much better but still bothers me daily . i am taking mirlaxa ever day- i never used to , although i was often constipated from childhood . now my stools are much smaller than they used to be . the less mirlax i take- the more my fissure hurts . do you have any ideas to help ? thanks.there may be people that aren ’ t aware of this , but another product that one should stay away from is bleached flour , & animal protein from meat , milk , & eggs which can get caught up in the pockets of the colon & create diverticulosis which can lead to diverticulitis . just imagine anyone that has ever done paper mache will remember that the way they made glue is by taking bleached flour & water , then mixing it together.i have just started my plant based whole foods “ diet ” / lifestyle 2 weeks ago and i ’ ve noticed that i have alot less bowel movements ? ? ? i thought i would have more … alot more gas but less of the other any insight would be great ! ! ! thanksthe opposite should be true , at least two a day . exercise plays a key role in bowel movements as well . if you are not getting enough exercise this could be the case.drink more watermy wife and i have changed to a whole foods plant based diet over a year a go . my wife recently had a physical and it showed that she had an over active thyroid . she has never had a problem before . what is the best way to remedy this through diet ? we are both in our late 40 ’ s.look into adding cruciferous vegetables to your diets . i believe they ’ ve been associated with at least slightly reducing thyroid activity.a delicious , whole , plant-based recipe for pasta fagioli . and easily made in a slow cooker . check out the fiber content of this baby ! http : / / www.gardendish.com / news / 2013 / 5 / 13 / slow-cooker-pasta-fagioli.htmllol … my favourite dish .. last time i made it i added cabbage … delicious , but very potent , gas wise .. lol thanks for the linki have been reading many of your posts on various topics and want to thank you for your contribution and service . i am a lay ( uncredentialed ) nutrition advocate , so this is not based on science , but is mainly experiential . is it possible that alzheimmers is diabetes of the brain and that hemrrhoids and anal fissures are anal diabetes ? i recently noticed the biggest culprit in sabotaging healing the latter , but in healing almost anything , is sugar ( and oil , of course ) . i used to label most illness as candida of the … … … … .. ( name the organ ) , but it may be less fungal and more sugar based . what ’ s your take on this ? being a natual healer ( 72 years & no medication ; run / walker of 8-10 miles daily ) , i am always looking to understand reasonable theory so that if it strikes me as true , i can use it skillfully . thank you for your time and consideration . sincerely , sandrasandra : “ 72 years & no medication ; run / walker of 8-10 miles daily ” is simply amazing . that ’ s so cool.i am a lay person myself , but thought i might be helpful : dr. barnard has two books which may help answer your questions . he explains the nature of diabetes in his book : dr. neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes . he also goes into alzheimers in his newest book : power foods for the brain . ( the first book , diabetes , would be the most relevant of the two for your question . ) while i don ’ t speak for dr. greger , based on dr. greger ’ s videos and recommendations , i guess that dr. greger would support the information in both of those books.after reading those books and doing some additional research , my personal opinion is that it does not make sense to classify alzheimmers as “ diabetes of the brain ” . if you ever read those books , i would be curious if you have a change of thoughts.i hope when i ’ m 72 that i move as much as you do . that ’ s quite inspirational . good luck.my bowel movements have grown in size and regularity . one huge one every morning . some nearing a pound . i was beginning to become concerned about the size , but now i understand why . i am 65 , as i learn more about nutrition , i eat more plant based . i have been doing this now for the past 15 months . i am now almost 100 % plant based diet . very interesting.i eat whole-food plant-based food that leaves me about 6 times a day.how do you feel about one taking trace mineralsok i have to admit that i had kind of a grade school giggle moment watching this video . i know it ’ s a very serious subject , and i mean to diminish the importance of the topic with stupid jokes , but then you also know the say , humour is the best medicine , so i guess i had my daily dose.i ’ ve always been something of a smart ass ( pun intended ) . i just couldn ’ t get my mind out of the toilet , which instisted on running through a series of really crappy jokes.after going through the list i finally concluded that , when one had ambitions to be a really big sh * t , maybe , in light of good colon health , that might be a really positive thing.your too funny . ok , after reading your post , now i ’ ve had * my * grade school moment.thanks ? ; - ) i love beets , everybody loves beets . i ’ m off to eat a big bowl of beets . wish me lucki believe there is such thing as impaired digestion or slow digestion . ancient indian medicine recommends pranayama or breathing techniques to increase digestive fires . it is also my understanding that nothing bad survives in oxygen … . i also believe that slow digestion gives rise to allergies … .. my beliefs in response to slow transit time … … above it says larger stool size is associated with lower risk of amongst other things constipation , i think there needs to be a lot of research done on this in relation to what co factors reduce that risk , because my wife has sever constipation even though we both eat the same things and visits the stool room only once every 3 or so days and has as a result large stools . transit time has to be in the days . i have daily usually 2-3 time daily movements and have a transit time of about 10-14 hours and have dv , so there ’ s a lot of compounding factors that i think are missing.if you are whole food plant based you should have at least one bowel m movement everyday . if not i would look at the diet . any dairy products could cause immobility in the bowel . children often have a horrible problem with this . make sure your wife is getting some exercise that makes her breath heavily and avoid prescription medications that cause constipation like pain killers . don ’ t live thirsty. anal fissure , anal health , appendicitis , beets , bowel movements , breast health , cancer , colon cancer , colon disease , colon health , constipation , diverticulitis , diverticulosis , fiber , hemorrhoids , nutrition myths , rectal cancer , stool size larger bowel movements are associated with lower risk of appendicitis , colon cancer , constipation , and diverticulitis . for more info on fiber intake and colon health , see these more recent videos : breast cancer and constipation can flax seeds help prevent breast cancer ? fiber vs. breast cancer breast cancer survival and lignan intakeplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . be sure to check out the other videos on bowel movements . also , there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos – please feel free to explore them !
PLAIN-3150	golden glow the reason. the peacock looks like this and the peahen looks like this , is because of sexual selection . the females prefer males with the most elaborate displays . how does this make sense evolutionarily ? how can appearance offer insight into the health of a potential mate.having such ornate , excessive plumage is risky . the poor peacock can hardly get off the ground . and this is hardly effective camouflage against predators . and so the fact that the peacock could survive despite such costly ornamentation offers a sense of how robust the bird ’ s genetics must be . so natural selection might favor females attracted to that sort of thing.so are you just born attractive or not ? well some species use diet to increase their sexual attractiveness . great tits prefer carotenoid-rich caterpillars which play an role in plumage pigmentation ; their breasts become brighter yellow , which is more attractive to potential mates , and a signal of how good they may be at procuring food and is a reflection of their health status , since yellow carotenoids like lutein are so health-promoting . so scientists wondered if the same phenomenon could be found in the human species.published in the international journal of primatology , “ facial skin coloration affects perceived health of human faces . ” “ the face plays a significant role in human interactions , including mate choice . ” so the researchers took digital photographs of caucasian men and women and allowed people to turn a dial to manipulate various color values until they came up with what they perceived to be the healthiest looking color , and both men and women preferred increased yellow , the proverbial golden glow . in other words , " greens to be gorgeous . " “ we suggest that the healthy appearance of skin yellowness may be attributable to dietary carotenoid deposition in the skin . this suggests that carotenoids , which are involved in health signaling and sexual selection in many species of birds and fish , may also affect the appearance of health in humans.in fact “ it is a popular view that suntanning enhances the healthy and attractive appearance of caucasian faces , but this research suggests that any benefit to health appearance from tanning is due to the associated increase in skin yellowness , and that if you separate it out people actually prefer the lighter but yellower skin , so better than a tanning bed to improve our healthfulness and attractiveness is a bed , of greens . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the 30 other videos on phytonutrients . also , there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! as much as i want to thank you for that email you sent me about your site , i think i ’ ve spent more time here watching videos that studying for med school this weekend ! haha , just kidding but this website has great and informative stuff ! i ’ ve already shared with nearly everyone i know.a healthy addiction i can assure you ! : ) hopefully some decent clinical nutrition will help your future patients more then all the kreb ’ s cycle reiterations combined . please do share the site with your colleagues and let me know if you have any questions as you progress through training.which foods are best for this healthy glow ? ? : ) nouh nailed it – see below ! : ) dark greens ; ) ? ? ! dark green leafies indeed ! more at http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / greens / ( and in the video today i specifically call out kale ! ) incidentally , i ’ ve greatly increased my kale consumption over the last three weeks . yay.also be sure to check out my associated blog post optimum nutrition recommendations ! omg , i eat spinach ! ! now it makes a lot of sense all the flirty looks i get when i buy groceries , yay.do you have any idea of which carotenoids in particular may have this effect ? thanks ! if your looking for good whole plant food sources of carotenoids , orange flesh sweet potatoes , greens and carrots can provide more then enough carotenoids to see this effect.great tits ? this is giving me pause … i have no desire to have orangy / yellowy / tan skin … particularly on my face . what about the coveted alabaster in centuries past … . maybe the yellowness of the skin was chosen in these studies because of changed in cultural preferences.anything special for facial pigmentation and melasma ? look , this is serious . if it becomes known that eating healthy will make you more attractive , then we may well have the key for adolescent dietary improvement that could well alter the health profile of generations to come . teens are immortal . at least i was at that age but being more attractive to women . wow ! i went with wfpbd for all the mundane things like avoiding arthritis , cancer , heart disease , et cetera . had i known sooner about becoming a “ babe magnet ” i almost certainly would make it to 100 + … .i can ’ t believe you actually managed to talk about the breasts of great tits . bravo ethnicity , evolution , greens , lutein , physical attraction , phytonutrients , sexual selection , skin health , tanning beds , vegetables how to be more attractive by eating carotenoid rich fruit and vegetables rather than tanning for healthy looking skin . some recent videos on carotenoids include : eating better to look better antioxidants and depression produce , not pills to increase physical attractivenessplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the 30 other videos on phytonutrients . also , there are 1,449 subjects covered in my other videos--please feel free to explore them as well !
PLAIN-3160	egg cholesterol in the diet the egg industry got their juevos handed to them last fall in a devastating review published in the canadian journal of cardiology by three academic heavy hitters . david spence is the director of the stroke prevention & atherosclerosis research centre ; david jenkins the guy who invented the glycemic index , and dr. davignon , the director of the hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis at the institute for clinical research statusthe last time dr. spence spoke out publically against eggs , his house got its cholesterol raised too , but reason they felt the need to set the record straight is that “ recent media reports reflect the remarkable effectiveness of the sustained propaganda campaign of the egg producer ’ s lobby to downplay the risk of cholesterol.the fundamental flaw of the studies the egg industry uses to muddy the waters on the issue is that they tend to only measure fasting cholesterol levels , which just reflects what ’ s happening to your arteries for the last few hours of the night , not after you ’ ve eaten breakfast . not only do eggs make your bad cholesterol go up , but for hours after you eat , dietary cholesterol increases the susceptibility of ldl to oxidize , vascular inflammation , oxidative stress , and postprandial hyperlipemia and potentiates the harmful effects of saturated fat , impairs endothelial function , and increases cardiovascular events , meaning heart attacks.dietary cholesterol may only increase our fasting cholesterol levels 10 % , but it may increase the susceptibility of our ldl to oxidize by 37-39 % , and that ’ s what triggers much of the arterial inflammation.so maybe an omelet might not be good , but how much dietary cholesterol is in just like one egg ? a single egg yolk contains approximately 215 mg to 275 mg of cholesterol ( depending on the size ) . the yolk of a large egg provides more than the 210 mg of cholesterol in a hardee ’ s monster thickburger , which contains two-thirds of a pound of beef , three slices of cheese and four strips of bacon . the media storm that followed compared an egg to the fast food monstrosity du jour , the kfc double down , where even the bun is made out of meat . what came worst : the chicken or the egg ? a single egg yolk … thus exceeds the recommended daily intake of cholesterol . so you could eat just like celery the whole rest of the day and you ’ d still be over the limit.despite the harassment he 's gotten , he remains unperturbed . he said yolks shouldn 't be regarded as an item that 's suitable for human diets for anyone at risk of vascular disease . and you name me one person that isn 't . check out my blog post “ bad egg ” to help put egg consumption in context , and don ’ t miss avoiding cholesterol is a no brainer and egg industry blind spot for more misleading claims from the egg industry . ( i posted this on the blog page relevant to this video , sorry for the duplication ) not all eggs are created equal.i had bookmarked from when i used to eat eggs this very interesting article on mother earth news : http : / / www.motherearthnews.com / eggs.aspx “ our testing has found that , compared to official u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) nutrient data for commercial eggs , eggs from hens raised on pasture may contain : • 1 ⁄ 3 less cholesterol • 1 ⁄ 4 less saturated fat • 2 ⁄ 3 more vitamin a • 2 times more omega-3 fatty acids • 3 times more vitamin e • 7 times more beta carotene ” also , i found a link to full research document on the benefits of pastured eggs : vitamins a , e and fatty acid composition of the eggs of caged hens http : / / www.windyridgepoultry.com / docs1 / eggstudy.pdfthat may be true of pasture-raised birds , but a new study published this summer found no significant difference between cholesterol levels in “ free-range ” compared to conventional eggs ( over 200mg per jumbo egg in each case ) . free-range eggs are certainly better from an animal welfare standpoint , and also less likely to be contaminated with salmonella ( the leading cause of food-borne illness related death in the united states ) , but don ’ t appear to have less cholesterol , the most important health reason to minimize one ’ s egg intake . “ • 1 ⁄ 3 less cholesterol • 1 ⁄ 4 less saturated fat ” – that ’ s not very convincing . “ less ” is good , but shouldn ’ t we instead strive to consume “ zero ” ? ( ok , cholesterol is also in most plants , but only at trace levels . ) vitamin a ? – a small bunch of spinach alone exceeds minium daily requirements ( microwave for 1 min and add a twist of lemon – awesome ) . omega 3 ? – a tablespoon of flax seeds from the coffee grinder goes great as a topping on oatmeal or as part of a sauce ( or take the supplement if you get too many 6 ’ s with grains ) . vitamin e ? – a daily handful of roasted almonds will blow you through the minimal requirements ( and provide some of the essential ca that many of us are short of ) .if you still think those egg yolks taste great do this – go to your local hospital , find the cardiology department , sit in the waiting room for an hour , and witness a world of suffering that might in part be unnecessary.hope this helps , patmamazing information , so glad i don ’ t eat eggs . just need to figure out how to get my parents to stop eating them ! i eat free-range eggs , all this info is wrong . i eat a lot of cholesterol and i ’ m willing to bet my cholesterol levels are much better than 90 % of the population . i have a lipoprofile from liposcience to prove it . dietary cholesterol in foods does not lead to cardiovascular disease. http : / / chriskresser.com / three-eggs-a-day-keep-the-doctor-awaygio , i ’ m sorry i wasn ’ t more clear in the video . the point the researchers were trying to make in their review is that it ’ s not the rise in cholesterol that accompanies the consumption of dietary cholesterol that is the primary problem . they note that you ’ d only expect a bump of 10 % in our cholesterol level eating eggs . it ’ s the oxidative , pro-inflammatory effects on the endothelium ( the “ life jacket ” lining of our arteries ) that is the primary reason we need to try to avoid eating cholesterol . unfortunately these effects are more difficult to accurately measure . and as to your final point , please see my reply your subsequent post below.the article you linked to makes reference to antioxidants in eggs purported to help one ’ s eyesight . stay tuned for tomorrow ’ s video-of-the-day as that ’ s exactly what i ’ m going to be talking about – perfect timing ! thank you for your contribution . i hope you ’ ll post more ! http : / / www.worldcat.org / oclc / 71808705i wrote about the cholesterol “ skeptics ” in my book carbophobia ( available free , full text online ) . one medical journal editorial entitled “ cholesterol myth club on par with flat earth society ” read “ as mixed up as flat earth society members obviously are , at least you can laugh their dumb idea off , and if you want to believe the earth is flat , this view is not going to cause serious problems like … coronary artery disease . ” ps : sorry for editing your post , gio , but as nutritionfacts.org is a strictly noncommerical site , i changed the bookseller link you posted to the equivalent library link.okay , sorry about the link , but , my c-reactive protein is extremely low , is this not a good measure of inflammation ? i ’ m not scared of eating cholesterol , after years of eating cafo meat , nuts , vegetables , fruit , grains , dairy , legumes , my cholesterol profile was terrible : 110 tg , 74 hdl , 135 ldl / after 1 year of paleo diet , nothing but grass fed beef ( fattest cut , no lean meat ) , vegetables , fruit , nuts , eggs ( increased consumption + 14 free range eggs per week ) , my levels with the lipoprofile from liposcience : 30 tg , 90 hdl , 95 ldl . i ate more foods with saturated fat and cholesterol , yet , my blood lipids are significantly better.hello again gio , the definition of health does not stem from a cholesterol reading so this idea you are bringing up of eating more animal products being healthful is false . cholesterol is only one tiny aspect of true health . the correlation between meat consumption and life quality is clear , as represented in this video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / meat-mortality / people who consume meat are at risk for a wide range of degenerative diseases and shorter lifespan . regarding your ridiculously high egg consumption , take a look at this video , http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-one-egg-a-day-too-much / egg consumption as well has been linked to a significantly shorter lifespan . regarding your “ grass fed ” beef , as dr. t. colin campbell puts it , the compositional make up of organic grass fed beef is minute and insignificant . it still contains the same amount of antioxidants and phytochemicals , basically 0 , as well as the same type of protein and nutrients . all beef and dairy is also a source of trans fat no matter how much fat you strip away http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / good-great-bad-killer-fats / and it is recommended 0 grams of trans fat per day . any amount exceeds this strict standard . regarding the healthful properties of meat consumption , meat does not have any phytochemicals which are necessary for a healthful body and contains about 1 or 2 antioxidants . check out this video regarding the comparison of animal to plant foods http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods / antioxidants are essential for longevity and overall health . animals foods cause much more rapid dna breaks compared with plant based eaters as seen here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / repairing-dna-damage / animal based foods also shorten lifespan by cutting down our telomeres , therefore forcefully causing an early death . plant based foods oppositely promote the telomerase enzyme which adds to the telomere , therefore increasing lifespan . view the video here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / research-into-reversing-aging / looking further into the power of plant foods and aging , it is now known that plant foods provide mitochondrial protection by promoting the enzyme superoxide dismutase . to learn more about why this is so significant view this video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / mitochondrial-theory-of-aging / basically , its a tumor suppressor and neurological protector . to promote this enzyme , it is significantly important to eat plant based . omnivores had 3 times less of this enzyme compared with vegetarians . taking a step back , and looking at meat besides the malicious damage done on our bodies , shows a product that is highly contaminated with heavy metals , pathogens and a massive array of other contaminants. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = beef meat , in an all around sense , is plain old , unhealthy.take a look at this : where are the vegan centenarians ? http : / / naturalhygienesociety.org / diet3.html # 8http : / / www.youtube.com /

gyhlkejzdpqthey are easy to find just google it : ) hello gio , you are correct , major populations that are typically centenarian are not vegan . but note that they do not consume meat in the quantity that we do and their meat is typically not as tainted as ours . even organic chicken contains arsenic in this country http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / arsenic-in-chicken / regardless though , the idea of whole foods plant based veganism is relatively new so we cannot accurately measure lifespan yet since we haven ’ t seen a full life of pure whole foods plant based . most people discover the diet midway through life . i was lucky enough to discover this early in my life . based on the damaging affect of meat consumption and the understanding of the incredible healing powers of plant foods , it is safe to assume , based on the overwhelming evidence , that one would live a very long , healthy , centenarian life under a whole foods plant based diet . an interesting article to view is our anatomy in comparison towards other omnivores and herbivores. http : / / www.vegsource.com / news / 2009 / 11 / the-comparative-anatomy-of-eating.html i am not making the case that we are herbivores but it is safe to say that we should definitely be getting 90 % of our calorie intake from plant sources based on our anatomy . it is similar to feeding cows corn , they aren ’ t supposed to eat corn and they encounter complications from doing so , but they can handle eating it . meat is our corn.arsenic ? so plants don ’ t absorb arsenic ? what planet do you live on ? http :

or not , humans evolved because we ate meat. http : / / www.proteinpower.com / drmike / low-carb-library / are-we-meat-eaters-or-vegetarians-part-ii / we are genetically evolved to eat meat . maybe not cafo meat , but meat that is from small production farms , grass finished . this is where i buy my meat . “ cafo meat is our corn ” is more accurate . where do you get this “ 90 % ” crap ? i eat a lot of plants , but i do not eat legumes , they are possibly one of the worst foods you can eat : http : / / whole9life.com / 2011 / 04 / legume-manifesto / based on our anatomy , we are meat eaters : http : / / www.mnforsustain.org / food _ ag _ worst _ mistake _ diamond _ j.htm oh , and that dr. mills article is bogus . why listen to a medical doctor on what he thinks constitutes an omnivore ? most anthropologists agree that we are omnivores.gio , i agree with your suggestion that hunter and gatherer societies of the past ate lots of meat . but then you state “ we are genetically evolved to eat meat ” … i disagree . you are suggesting that past meat consumption is somehow relevant to how we should eat today to obtain optimal health.if meat consumption in the past had provided the darwininan selective pressure necessary to make meat a requirement for good health , then you would not need to argue with a group of vegans who are living perfectly healthful lives . in other words , it would be obvious to us too ! the fact is that people can obtain all required nutrition by following a whole foods plant based diet while simultaneously enjoying the benefits of a greater supply of antioxidants and a lower burden of toxins than obtainable on an omnivorous diet.these obscure pieces of random evidence do not prove your point . you obviously want this to be true so bad . sorry , its not . no matter how hard you believe it to be true it wont be . i have explained my point several times now and this is becoming a circuitous argument . you are blind to the overwhelming evidence and are obsessed with your own fragmented argument . if you wish to cherry pick random information on the benefits of meat , ok . but you have to acknowledge the health detriments that come along with it . you treat meat as the best food on earth , and again , i have explained why it isn ’ t several times now so it is silly for me to state it again since you don ’ t seem to care . but then again , its more about the viewers of this debate that must decide who is more “ correct ” . for now , i have made my point and do not wish to carry on this debate any longer , its going no where.your very own “ obscure pieces of random evidence do not prove your point . ” you may think that vegan / vegetarian is healthier , but “ no matter how hard you believe it to be true it wont be ” . “ health detriments ” , right . you keep on believing your pcrm sources of info , after all they tell lies , and if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it , people will eventually come to believe it . you need to read the vegetarian myth by lierre keith.oh and what about steve jobs ? wasn ’ t he a vegetarian ? he died of pancreatic cancer , glad that meat-free diet worked out for him.please watch dr mcdougall ’ s video on how steve jobs died , he actually lived longer because he was a vegan.really ? your going to go there ? vegetarian implies that dairy and eggs are still in the diet as well as the possibility of processed foods . again , you ignore the facts.steve jobs ate fish as well … … … our environment can also give us cancer . but that ’ s another story . i so wish he tried the gerson therapy.the gerson therapy . what kind of garbage is that ? ? http : / / www.quackwatch.com / 01quackeryrelatedtopics / cancer.htmlto gio , um … .. i have read a lot of information regarding the gerson therapy . including your nice little quack watch link . until they add chemotherapy to the quack watch site , i don ’ t give it much merit . garbage ? i do know it ’ s not the “ same ” garbage that killed 5 people i know this summer . i do know that people have cured themselves , and longer than the 5 year cure that the acs considers cured , for decades from pancreatic cancers , melanomas , etc … .. i am also following a mother and daughter using the therapy for 2 different types of cancers . the daughter had already tried therapies that would not be on quack watch , like drugs , chemo , and radiation . they didn ’ t work . people should have options available to them . i also feel like you seem more angry then wanting to engage in a conversation about how we can better things and so don ’ t think it ’ s prudent to spend any further time engaging with you . wish you luck on your journey and that you find peace.um … … .. i also think the cholesterol test that we run today is bogus . that ’ s why people think that cholesterol has nothing to do with heart disease , well at least maybe one reason . the vap test measures not only the generic stuff , but goes pretty in depth . check those vldl levels , as you can have “ normal ” ( and what is normal in the states , is well , whatever ) cholesterol & be in a bad way . also , your particle size . in addition to the fact that this was about inflammation . there isn ’ t enough land anyhow , to raise all the “ perfect ” meat & dairy so the world could eat like us . but i think the 75 % obesity rate is probably speaking for itself-but paleoman , i would get a vap test , which should be free if you can get the script . just to ensure that you are as squeaky clean as you think , and then get it repeated every so often as you age.damn right the cholesterol tests we run today are bogus . i ’ m sorry but the vap test is not as accurate as the nmr lipoprofile i got from liposcience . everything was measured directly and not estimated with the friedewald formula . the lipoprofile gives you large vldl , small vldl , large hdl-p , vldl size , hdl size , hdl size , and insulin resistance score ( i scored an 8 out of 100 ) also , my c-reactive protein is 35 % lower , which means significantly less inflammation . i ’ m willing to bet my levels are better than yours . also , in my family , we all have naturally high cholesterol levels ( men and women ) . because of the cholesterol vilifying doctors in america , one of my cousins decided to go vegan , after 10 years on the diet ( lost weight , lowered cholesterol ) , he was the very first person in my family to have a heart attack . yes he ate plenty of b12 . and by the way , obesity has nothing to do with eating meat , i am 6 feet , currently 185 lbs with 6 % body fat. http : / / high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com / 2009 / 02 / cholesterol-presentation-between.htmlhello gio , just to clarify , vegan does does not mean healthful . one can be a junk food vegan eating oil , fried foods , white bread , soy isolates , processed foods , etc . eating these foods defeats the purpose of being vegan if one is looking for a healthful approach over an ethical one . on a whole foods plant based diet on the other hand , it is extremely difficult to achieve heart disease ( unless you eat nutrient poor foods such as white potato and coconuts but in general this is the case ) . the epithelial cell wall surrounding your blood vessels and arteries repairs and never becomes damaged . this wall is responsible for keeping your blood smooth as well as contracting and expanding . this video by dr. caldwell essylsten explains the process. http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = aytf0z _ zvs0 as stated in my above comment to you , meat brings on a wide array of illnesses . being skinny with a low body fat percentage does not signify good health , as does a low cholesterol reading . again , advocating meat into ones diet is extremely harmful and the blog post link you submitted is a look at only cholesterol . for more information on cholesterol and other issues , check out this video , http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / convergence-of-evidence / fact : humans are omnivores , always have been always will be . i do not eat cafo meat , it is nothing but antibiotics , growth hormones , and surplus germs . grass-fed , free-range , hormone / antiobiotic-free animal meat is completely different . as a meat eater , i also eat a lot of vegetables , in fact i make it a point to eat more vegetables than meat . not only is my cholesterol optimal , but my c-reactive protein is low and my insulin sensitivity is optimal . currently at 6 feet , 190 lbs , i have 10 % body fat . as you can see i am far from obese ( meat does not make you fat ) . oh , i eat mostly the fatty cuts of meat , not the lean kind . furthermore , the acid / alkaline balance in my blood is at optimal levels , meaning that meat does not cause bone degeneration . take a look at this study : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16804013 ? ordinalpos = 5 & itool = entrezsystem2.pentrez.pubmed.pubmed _ resultspanel.pubmed _ rvdocsumand read this : http : / / www.proteinpower.com / drmike / sugar-and-sweeteners / vegetarians-age-faster-2 / i am enjoying this debate gentlemen ! to those who think that vegans / vegetarians are “ healthier ” : i run a strength & conditioning program ( not a stupid gym ) and this is what i ’ ve noticed : all vegetarians / vegans i ’ ve seen come through are weaker , have more body fat , get sick more often than the rest of us . all the physical fitness tests we run , they all fail to even come close to the strength gains , endurance / stamina / speed / agility / balance / coordination that us “ meat eaters ” achieve . in fact , one of my clients has just recently started eating meat , ditching the legumes and grains , and guess what ? in just three months , he ’ s considerably stronger than the rest of the vegetarians . he just told me that he has never felt better , and his doctor can ’ t believe the amount of fat he has lost and is happier with his lab results . he has put on more muscle , lost fat , no longer looks “ skinny fat ” . his endurance / speed / stamina has increased tremendously . he is making it his mission to convert people to this much healthier lifestyle . oh , he is also able to sleep better and have more energy.hello gio , one must weigh out the pros and cons of high meat consumption . as i have stated several times before , body fat percentage is not an indicator of good health . to consume fatty parts of meat , especially beef , is simply not health promoting as you will see in this video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / good-great-bad-killer-fats / you will of course stumble upon evidence that says “ there are benefits to meat ” , but i am still waiting to see the evidence that nutrient dense plant sources are harmful or reduce lifespan . who can find information on why kale will harm us ? the overwhelming evidence points to plant based . your making a great point that there are benefits to meat but there are also much more harms that come with the benefits . take spirulina for example , it is 70 % protein , can control blood sugar levels , blood pressure , cholesterol and helps with seasonal allergies . yet we look at the harms and spirulina may dissolve our muscles from the inside out , can cause liver cancer from the hepatotoxins it has and it contains a potent neuro toxin in it that can cause nerve damage. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = spirulina the harms outweighs the good so the wisest choice would be to avoid it . another point to make is that unless your sourcing meat from a local farm , it will be contaminated no matter if it is organic or conventional.you are using semantics in a failed attempt to sound clever . obviously , no one is saying that kale will “ harm us . ” it ’ s what a vegan is leaving out of the diet that is harmful.who can deny that a diet which includes animal protein is optimal for humans , when it is a scientific and nutritional fact that the human body cannot be healthy without the vitamin b12 that animal protein , and no other food , provides ? if you have to supplement your diet with regular visits to gnc , then your diet is unsuitable for a human.i cannot imagine that there needs to be further argument , when that one , simple , undeniable fact all on it ’ s own cannot be overcome by any argument a vegan could make in support of the “ experiment ” they call a diet.the fact that we have survived , and thrived , for as many years as a species as we have proves out the efficiency and effectiveness of animal protein in our diet.if we were not meant to be meat eaters , why then do our bodies require the vitamin b12 which can only be found naturally in animal protein ? seems a little odd that we would have that requirement for our bodies not just to be healthy , but to survive ? ? ? ? if one is using the “ personal experience ” game then i can show you this too http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = zsjbmn _ copoin addition to this video above , i am a sponsored rock climber and my greatest strength gains have come since dropping meat . more endurance , quicker recoveries , high energy , etc . the personal experience game will not work , one must use scientific sources as a source of evidence.right , let me know when a vegetarian / vegan actually does well in the crossfit games.griff ’ s comment about b12 does indicate humans evolved as omnivores . however , it does not follow that omnivory is an optimal human diet . most of our evolutionary history was spent without modern medicine or science but few people would argue the absence of these in our life is an optimal way to live . also , evolution only cares if an organism survives to reproduce successfully . human lifespans were much shorter in our evolutionary past so meat eating may work fine for paleo humans who died around age 40 after raising their children . good luck ! why not just stick to your diet then … … .why waste your time being angry on this site ? dietary cholesterol is packaged in the gut into chylomicrons , which do not become ldl . the cholesterol in ldl comes from the liver . so it doesn ’ t make a lot of sense to talk about dietary cholesterol and ldl . where has it been shown that atherosclerosis is caused by cholesterol ; the presence of cholesterol in plaques is not a proof of cause . spence et al said “ based on the careful and independent conclusions of ancel keys ” . keys was the originator of the idea that saturated fats are a cause of heart disease ; he cherry picked his data to justify this . a consideration of all the data then available would not have backed his conclusion . i have also read that even keys didn ’ t blame dietary cholesterol . there is no direct proof that dietary saturated fat is a risk in heart disease . animal studies on cholesterol are questionable , especially if the animal in question cannot regulate its cholesterol production in response to dietary cholesterol ( which of course one would expect in animals that naturally do not consume cholesterol . ) drrggibbs , you are spot on ! http : / / high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.com / search /

key-integrated-functions-of-your-body / cardiovascular / cholesterol-is-your-body-s-most-powerful-defense-against-toxins-and-free-radicals / hello gio , nobody is doubting cholesterol is necessary for proper health . no doubt ! the human body actually creates this cholesterol and plants actually contain very minute amounts of cholesterol as well . but this implies we need very little extra sources of cholesterol . it is like the amino acids , the non essential ones do not need to be focused on because our body produces them but the essential ones are necessary for proper health . similarly to cholesterol is arachadonic acid , our bodies produce this chemical so we don ’ t need to consume extra quantities of it . the cat , which is a strict meat eater , does not produce arachadonic acid because it obtains it from animal sources. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / inflammatory-remarks-about-arachidonic-acid / meat contains more arsenic than plants … … … .we may not be able to avoid something entirely but we can minimize exposure . and to anyone wanting to know the true health regarding cholesterol-have your doctor get you a vap test . this will break down all the types of cholesterol and show you particle size . sure , your total number can be 156 and you can have a heart attack , but if you break down those numbers then there is probably a number out of whack . ldl ( c ) is one to watch … … .it is your legal right to egg eggs , however i am not happy that i as a taxpayer am subsidizing them . these are peer reviewed studies , so it isn ’ t like he is making the information up . it is also not like the places he cites studies from are “ pro vegan ” in the least ! ! the vap test is ancient technology . get an nmr lipoprofile like i did , it is a lot more accurate . i ’ ve already shared my lipoprofile on this site , i have the large particle , harmless ldl . ldl is not “ one to watch ” , it is only 1 number , you also need to watch your tgs , mine are ultra low , you also need a good high hdl , which mine is . also , c-reactive protein measure the inflammation on your body ; inflammation directly contributes to heart health , mine is ultra low , lower than 90 % of the population . also , you must pay attention to insulin sensitivity , a known contributor to heart disease . as for the eggs , i get mine that are free-range , antibiotic and hormone free , they are not subsidized . plus , people who have low cholesterol have heart attacks . and please debunk this study , it shows that women with higher cholesterol live longer : http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1111 / j.1365-2753.2011.01767.x / pdfour body also already makes cholesterol . so yes , we may need it , but it is already there ! this is what i find really funny : my entire family has “ naturally high cholesterol ” , whatever that means . one of my cousins decided to do something about it and he went vegan . he took all the proper supplementation under the supervision of a vegan nutritionist , he lowered his cholesterol below everyone in my family . after 10 years , he was the first person in my family to have a heart attack . people with low cholesterol have heart attacks.did he have all of those tests done ? ? ? ? we don ’ t know your brother or what his situation is but since only 1 % of the population may be vegan , i am doubting that us vegans have all the heart disease , cancer , & diabetes in the country . you are allowed to eat however you feel is ethical and your food is subsidized . that makes it very nice for you . i choose to minimize the suffering around me because i cannot actually live another way . it isn ’ t a choice for me . and minimize is the key word here.it ’ s my cousin , not my brother . my food is not subsidized . yes , he had all these tests done , his tgs were elevated , near 120 , that ’ s awful , mine hover around 35-45 . his ldl was exceptionally low- 53 , his hdl was around 60 . he had really high c-reactive protein- lots of inflammation , probably from those “ healthy ” whole grains.wow , reading your comments make me shriver . i was diagnosed with breaast cancer last year … i was given the book the china study to read , i went cold turkey to a plant based diet never looked back. you see i am runner and always believed we need aminal protein for muscle recovery and to get stronger .. being on plant base diet i have more energy plus i feel much stronger … no only did i refuse chemo & radiation , my last pet scan showed some tumors gone , some shrunk and not growing . animal protein raises estrogen in women which feeds cancer cells , lots of women are now going vegan for this reason.it ’ s hard to know what he was actually eating : ) i can only speak for myself and my numbers were great … … … .i will still probably get mesothelioma from going into abandoned homes in east st. louis with the rescue group … .. but hoping to utilize gerson or something non chemo if something like that does ever happen . i can only choose my own diet , and i started going this over 30 years ago , when i was a child , because i did not have a choice . i am thrilled with the health benefits it has given me personally , but that obviously was not my concern in grade school . to tell me to eat burgers would have been like telling a child to kill his / her dog : ) in my family my mom is the only one not with high cholesterol or other issues like that , and she is pretty much vegan , always vegetarian . she has a ton of other stress from working nights and parenting … .but so far she has avoided medications . her father died at 43 of a heart attack . my health & the enivronment are just fringe benefits of this lifestyle for me . i personally cannot eat meat or dairy . i do go to a preventive care doctor and so far after 30 years of plants , apparently everything is great . but that isn ’ t why i ’ m doing this . but i have lost several people , not in my family , to cancer , and i do feel passionately about food choices and cancer risks.odd , i ’ ve eaten no less than a dozen eggs a day , sometimes even raw , along with bacon , sausage , butter , red meat , and a long list of things that all the experts say are ‘ bad ’ , haven ’ t eaten anything soy in almost a year , yet my doc says that i ’ m in better shape and health than 99 % of all patients he ’ s ever seen , including all his patients on vegetarian and vegan diets.i am not sure what your doctor is using to define as “ healthy ” since you seem to be lacking any sort of phytonutrients and fiber . check out dr. mcdougall ’ s article on high protein diets , and why weight loss occurs initially as well as the initial lowering of cholesterol and etc. http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / res _ high _ protein _

videos / antioxidant-power-of-plant-foods-versus-animal-foods / if you are trying to eat paleolithic and avoid complex carbohydrates this seems silly to me . i find it interesting that people idealize these ancient peoples . they had no knowledge of nutrition at all , they just ate whatever was available , it wasn ’ t about health and nutrition it was , eat whatever you can find to survive . they had very short lifespans as well so i wouldn ’ t idealize that , we have a lot more knowledge about what foods are healthy for us and we have the variety available to us to choose , they did not have that luxury . they hunted because during climate change , migration and famine or drought there was nothing else to eat . that ’ s like people in another million years saying back in in the 1900 ’ s a lot of people smoked cigarettes so why shouldn ’ t we ? furthermore , current meat eating populations have significantly lower lifespans then most advanced countries . for example , the inuit live 10 years less on average then the average canadian , and the average canadian eats similar to the average american . so your looking at the 60 ’ s for survival . the maize are an african population that eat all animal products as well and live on average to about the age of 45 , they don ’ t usually make it past 60 . the okinawan on the other hand are plant based and usually live to be centenarians . choose your team wisely ! i think the point is that we evolved eating that way – our bodies adjusted to that because that ’ s what there was . people may have had shorter life spans , but we certainly survived and thrived as a species . meat and fat were instrumental in growing the big brains we have as humans , and there is much speculation that the effects of hunting and adding that fat-rich animal protein to our diets is what grew our brains and separated us from the apes in intelligence and culture.and i ’ m not sure what you mean by holding up any japanese or other asian culture as plant-based . they have always eaten a great deal of fish , and also ate pork and chicken . ? ? ? they also relied heavily on soy – does that mean we should ? griff , i encourage you to explore this site and view what more studies dr. greger collects . i also encourage you to view atkins exposed , a book written by dr. greger that directly attacks high protein diets. http : / / www.atkinsexposed.org / you know , i have explored veganism – a couple of years ago i came to a place in my life where i knew i had to make some dietary changes for my health . i explored veganism , talked with many vegans , attended group gatherings , and seriously considered the possibility for myself . what i kept coming back to again and again was that most vegans “ think ” they feel great , but for a variety of reasons many begin to eat animal protein again , and suddenly realize they weren ’ t feeling all that great after all . i heard many stories from former vegans , but some common themes were recurrent . chiefly , poor immune response to viruses ; long , drawn-out , and life changing recovery times ; increasing weakness over time ; depression and hypersensitivity to everyday circumstances ; slowed mental responses ; bad skin and hair loss ; and the list went on and on . mind you , these weren ’ t people who just woke up one day and decided to quit eating animal protein . one gentleman was a naturopath . another was an acupuncturist , and another a chiropractor ! these are folks who researched a diet free of animal protein prior to making that change in their lives , and still were disappointed at how their health declined . at the very least i would have to say it ’ s just not a healthy diet for everyone.another consideration for a lot of people is a sensitivity to carbohydrates . i am not able to devote that much of my diet to carbohydrates . when i have done so , in the absence of protein , i am rendered completely useless from a constant feeling of sleep deprivation , caused , i believe , from spikes in insulin . i will not be eating huge quantities of soy in any form , and beans and grains disagree with me more than any other foods i ’ ve ever tried.i am hesitant to agree that a vegan diet is sustainable for a long , healthy life . i have heard comparisons between the human digestive tract and that of the great apes . no one seems to consider the fact that if they aren ’ t washing their food ( and they ’ re not ) they aren ’ t eating as purely vegan a diet as a lot of folks want to claim . insect matter covers most surfaces , unless it is washed away . chimps use tools like twigs to plumb termite mounds for their inhabitants on a regular basis . and who can forget the scenes of carnage , readily seen on the national geographic channel , of chimp and gorilla males riling up their underlings to attack and kill the young of rival males in order to bring the females into estrus ? and they aren ’ t just killing them , they share the meat of those babies between themselves . vegan ? i think not.for me , the fact that our meat-eating diet has provided us the nutrients to survive , thrive , and rise above our primate relations over the course of our history as humans is enough to prove out it ’ s effectiveness as a adequate and healthy diet . veganism is about as “ new-age ” a diet as it gets . scientists agree that if ever there had been a purely vegan society anywhere on earth , they certainly didn ’ t last long enough to leave traces of themselves.over the course of my research , many vegans pointed to some indigenous indian populations as shining examples of societies who ate a vegan diet and glowed with health . well , we all know the folly of that story – their native diet was so infested with insect matter that they remained healthy , and when they attempted to replicate their diet in western europe , they became malnourished because the food in the western world was free of insect infestation.i would like to see science based evidence that a vegan diet is not healthy , rather than personal anecdotes and assumptions . so far , the science is in the total favor of a plant based diet and it is well known that a whole foods , plant based diet can , and does reverse degenerative diseases that occur today . again , i encourage you to explore the website thoroughly , as you have apparently not done so.http : / / www.westonaprice.orgi ask you for science based evidence and you show me a page that has outlandish , unsupported claims ? the first thing i see is “ cod liver oil is a super food ” yet dr. greger thoroughly revokes this claim. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-cod-liver-oil-good-for-you / when you find scientific , peer reviewed studies and reviews on the ill effects of a vegan diet be sure to pass it on . i can point to many that show meat to be quite harmful , or you can look for yourself by simply looking through this site.one of the authors of this study , j. david spence md , is one of the world ’ s leading experts in stroke prevention . in his book “ how to prevent your stroke , ” he indicates that people who desire meat in their diet should eat no more than 2 oz. every day ( or 4 oz. every other day ) .or of course , you could dispense with meat entirely.how is it that there is still argument about what constitutes an adequate diet for humans when we know that the human body requires * * for survival * * vitamins that can only be provided by the consumption of animal protein ? i ’ m talking of course about vitamin b12 , or does no one else seem to see that if you have to supplement your diet with a visit to gnc , your diet is obviously not suitable for human survival ? ? ? and why is it that so many of the vegans i ’ ve met , be they well-informed and educated vegans , who think they are making the right dietary decision for their health , or those that just can ’ t eat anything that “ has a face ” , end up depressed , slow-witted , angry , forgetful , sickly , and have no energy or drive ? hmmmm … . makes me wonder if there isn ’ t something missing from their diets … .look at the replies here that are for and against the vegan diet . one of the two groups is clearly displaying what is maybe not quite anger but clearly aggression.if you stop eating animals your blood lust might just stop.you are meeting the wrong vegans ; ) and yet , neither of you addresses the question of vitamin b12.there was no need to address that non-issue.maybe you could just explain why it ’ s a non-issue then , because i ’ d really like to hear what you think- “ non-issue ” means it ’ s nothing to worry about . a simple google search would have found you the definition of that phrase easily.okay , i have googled the subject of vitamin b12 , and read books , and talked with dr.s. , and i ’ m thinking it might be a bigger issue than you realize . i ’ m asking you to explain why you think vitamin b12 , as it relates to nutrition , is a non-issue . can you do that ? i would really appreciate it . it seems like if you know anything about it you would be able to expound on why you think it ’ s a non-issue , but if you don ’ t know , then … .. plants and animals cannot make their own vitamin b12 . b12 is synthesized through the fermentation of microorganisms , most commonly pseudomonas denitrificans and propionibacterium shermanii.eating animals is completely unnecessary for getting vitamin b12.hello griff , dr. greger explains in his later videos ( not released yet until a few weeks ) more on the topic of b12 . vitamin b12 is a byproduct of bacteria , it was once found in our water supply , and on the plant foods we eat . because we now chlorinate our water ( to avoid getting sick from other bugs ) and because we dont ground pick our vegetables from the wild without washing them , the only available source is now from animal products . this is of course an unnatural setting . similarly , iodine is no longer found in plant foods . this is why the government iodized salt , to help americans get adequate iodine intake . similarly still , we do not expose ourselves to adequate sunlight , and the uv rays of today are much more potent then they once were in our evolutionary past so vitamin d must be supplemented for optimal health.humans have changed their environment , so sometimes supplements are necessary to achieve optimal health. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / vitamin-supplements-worth-taking / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / vitamin-d-supplements-may-be-necessary / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2 / okay . point made , point taken . i will no longer use that as my argument against veganism . i still disagree that it is sustainable for the planet , as most vegans seem to claim , but you are correct on this point . why didn ’ t you just say so to begin with ? i didn ’ t say it to begin with because anyone who actually looked into vitamin b12 already knows where to get it and where it comes from.as for the meat diet providing us “ the nutrients to survive , thrive , and rise above our primate relations over the course of our history as humans , ” the biggest boost to our development as a species was the discovery / invention of cooking.also be sure to check out my associated blog post bad egg ! does the lecithin in eggs stop cholesterol absorption ( as some claim ) or inhibit the inflammatory and oxidative effects ? no it does not , cholesterol in eggs as well as the marked levels of arachadonic acid found in eggs both cause problems . “ diet is not all about fasting lipids ; it is mainly about the three-quarters of the day that we are in the nonfasting state . fasting lipids can be thought of as a baseline ; they show what the endothelium was exposed to for the last few hours of the night . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2989358 / ? tool = pubmedthe fact of the matter is , nutrition is entirely dependent on the individual . saying that everyone should be raw vegan , or vegetarian , or whatever is just plain short sighted . there is a guy in india who is an oxygenarian . does that mean we should all just not eat anything ? plants have feelings too . this has been proven time and time again , so your ethics argument is completely false . nutritionally , you can get what you need from plants , but you can only do this because of the modern system of food production and delivery . people living in siberia don ’ t eat strictly vegetables because they simply cannot grow what they need to remain healthy . they eat meat , and guess what ? they are perfectly healthy doing that and have lived for 1000 ’ s of years without the same problems people have in modern society.there is no ethical reason not to eat meat . you cannot hold the life of a cow over the life of an insect , and your strict vegetarian diet kills way more insects than cows . environmentally there is some argument there , but to say that no meat should ever be consumed would through the balance of wildlife out of whack . we do not have enough predators to keep the prey in line , and many prey animals simply starve to death if they are not culled by hunters using them for meat.much of the research is flawed anyway because science has this nasty little secret no one wants to admit . there is no way to accurately assume that a small sample of the population from one area of the world is an accurate representation of the entire human population . there is no way to eliminate all the variables that could effect a studies outcome so any study you see in regard to human interaction is flawed at it ’ s core . until you can bring an infant up in a lab and never feed it eggs , then have it ’ s identical twin grow up in the same lab and experience the exact same introduction of nutrients with the addition of eggs , you will never have an accurate assessment of the effect eggs have on the human biology.all of this is junk science disguised behind lobbyists and people who claim they know what is best . eat meat if you want . there is nothing wrong with it . get off your high horse and stop trying to change the way people live their lives.nutrition is an individual thing . one thing that works for one person may or may not work for another . all of this is junk science . any time you see someone referencing a “ study ” the study itself does not adhere to true scientific principals . there are too many variables involved to determine anything even remotely accurate . this is the dirty little secret of the health industry . they want you to believe that a small sample of the population is representative of everyone on the planet.to really understand what is happening , you would have to have two babies who were identical twins . they would have to be raised in a lab where they were introduced to the exact same nutrition and stimulus their entire lives until the variable was changed . one twin would be given eggs and one would not . then their life would continue in parallel until some kind of symptom arose in the one given eggs. then you would get a true scientific conclusion . anything less is just opinion.as for the vegan debate , please just stop it . vegans and vegetarians have no solid ground . if you indulge in that lifestyle for ethical reasons , your ethics are flawed . plants have a consciousness , and have been proven to experience fear and pain . nonetheless , millions of insects die as a result of the cultivation of plants . to say that insect or plant life is less precious than animal life is absurd . it is also absurd to say that an animal fears more or feels more pain than an insect or a plant.if you want to spout off about the environmental impact , you may want to look at how we have destroyed biodeversity with plants . there are thousands of varietals that are extinct now for the sake of growing standard vegetables . then there is the issues of pesticides , insecticides , and gmo ’ s which are all a result of vegetable production . certainly there is a heavy price for animal production , but to say that vegetable production is any less destructive is once again absurd.i won ’ t even being to talk about the environmental impact if we simply let all of the animals go free and had no checks in place to regulate populations . just talk to the fish and game people about deer and you will understand how out of whack we are with the predator / prey dynamic in many parts of the world.if you are a vegetarian or a vegan for health reasons , again , you have no ground to stand upon. there are plenty of cultures and people who do not have the luxury of going to the grocery store to buy ingredients shipped in from far away cultures . they eat what is local , and they can only get certain vitamins and minerals from animal sources . many of these cultures do not have the same diseases western cultures do , and certainly do not have them at the epidemic levels the west does . your health is not entirely dependent on what you put into your moth , so trying to profess that you can be healthy simply by not eating animals is once again absurd.most people who hide behind these things are really only choosing a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle out of vanity . you want to have that false sense of superiority or a false sense of ethics . you are being absurd and when you spout off it only proves how absurd you really are . eat some bacon . it ’ s not going to kill you as fast as a million other factors will.if you truly believe that the peer-reviewed scientific research is “ junk , ” and that human nutrition is beyond the study of modern science , then why are you here on a research-reporting website clogging up the comments section ? no one is talking about the ethics of meat consumption except you . this website is for those of us who want to keep up with the lastest in health and nutrition research . thank you.wow , corbin you obviously have too much time on your hands . i disagree with most of what you say , however , ill only touch on the nutrition side of it . yes , everyones bodies are different but the plant based diet has so much powerful research behind it , with very convincing studies and research . vegans often eat terribly so that means nothing . but if you eat a whole food , plant based diet , i believe it would be a healthy choice for most , if not everyone , with certain needed supplementation for certain people . yes , one piece of bacon wont kill you but even one piece does have an effect on the endothelial cells in your arteries , thus effecting your chances for atheroclerosis through a nitric oxide effect . look at dr. esselyton ’ s book , how to prevent and reverse heart disease . there is nothing in meat and dairy that you cant get from a plant based diet , except b-12 in some cases , in which you can supplement . you should try it , you may be surprised . i ’ m always open to new research and may change my diet at some time , but for now not eating meat and dairy is a no brainer for me.nice info , very helpfully doc ! ! ! if you consume 30-40g of dietary fiber through foods a day , doesn ’ t that lower the amount of dietary cholesterol in your blood ? yes dietary cholesterol is lowered by a higher intake of fiber . you can review the topic summary by denise see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / cholesterol / and follow the links to see the various factors that can lower your cholesterol . there are currently 93 videos relating to cholesterol on nutritionfacts.org. of course when you are consuming a lot of fiber you are consuming a lot of plants which means you are consuming less animal products and hence less cholesterol and saturated fats . oatmeal for breakfast does lower cholesterol partly from the effects of the oatmeal and partly due to the other breakfast foods it replaces such as eggs.dr barry sears ( of zone diet ) states that the yolk is the biggest problem because it contains so much aracodonic acid ; therefore his suggestion is to remove the yolk if one wishes to eat eggs.egg yolks are the problem . egg whites are still a fantastic source of protein . learn how to remove the yolks . for cooking purposes , 2 whites = whole egg.stacy : i like to paraphrase dr. barnard who wrote something like , “ there are big problems with eggs , the white and the yolk . ” actually , there are more problems , like with salmonella , but that is a bit of a digression.i ’ m glad you understand the problem with the yolk . the problem with the white is that it is pure animal protein , the type that likely promotes cancer growth . if you would like to learn more about how this works , you can check out the following video series on this nutritionfacts site : • igf-1 as one-stop cancer shop • cancer-proofing mutation • the answer to the pritikin puzzle • protein intake & igf-1 production • higher quality may mean higher risk • animalistic plant proteins • too much soy may neutralize benefits • how much soy is too much ? • plant-based bodybuildinggood luck.from what i have learned in various nutrition courses and cancer related course work , animal proteins are not the problem either . preparation techniques are the problem . over processing , including over cooking in general increases presence of carcinogens in food as a rule . not just meat.if you have any peer reviewed , published primary articles with research to back up your claims , i ’ d love to read it.stacy : it ’ s great you want to look at the primary studies . if you look under each video on this site , you will see a “ sources cited ” section that you can expand . thus , if you follow the video series i referenced above , starting with igf-1 as one-stop cancer shop , you can get the references to the direct studies.also , you might consider reading the book the china study . that book discusses studies linking dairy protein to cancer ( as well as some other studies if memory serves ) . also if memory serves , the book includes the full references to the peer reviewed published research.good luck.i love the china study – great recommendation.can you get too low of cholesterol ? someone said they are vegan but eat eggs because of the cholesterol.it ’ s someone i know.no. our bodies make all the cholesterol we need.i ’ m really frustrated right now . i openend scholar.google.nl to seek for “ eggs and heart ” . and i continue seeing studies with conclusions like : – “ higher consumption of eggs ( up to one egg per day ) is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke . ” http : / / www.bmj.com / content / 346 … – conclusions we did not find a significant positive association between egg consumption and increased risk of mortality from chd or stroke in the us population . these results corroborate the findings of previous studies. http : / / dx.doi.org / 10.1017 / s136 … – “ conclusions : no association between egg consumption and the incidence of cvd was found in this mediterranean cohort . ” http : / / www.nature.com / ejcn / jou … i ’ m not an egg advocate or something but feel frustrated about conflicting messages . i don ’ t have the authority at this point to judge all this information . i ’ m just left feeling frustrated about this . one party says : avoid eggs like the pest . the other says : eggs are ok . can the true egg-conclusion please stand up.i hear you . one thing i ’ ve noticed is that any doctor i talk to tells me that you can absolutely get all the healthy nutrition you need from a plant-based diet , whereas many doctors are extremely concerned about meat , eggs and dairy . no one is worried about the broccoli and kale , so i take my b-12 supplement and eat the things that are agreed by everyone to be safe.so what about this article from dr. mercola ? http : / / articles.mercola.com / sites / articles / archive / 2010 / 08 / 10 / making-sense-of-your-cholesterol-numbers.aspx # _ edn2i ’ m so confused about who has the definitive answer . but all i get is a cesspool of yes and no . is mercola referring to the egg industry studies ? or are these claims backed by non suspicious candidates ? and what about people who are in shape and do resistance training exercise ? and what about hormones and cholesterol ? for a resistance trained athlete who would need more testosterone to build muscle , is the amount produced the body enough ? can the body up its production to meet test needs for muscle ? do these studies apply to low body fat % resistance trained athletes ? so many questions ! don ’ t buy into dr. mercola . he has some very backwards theories and is a well known quack in the scientific community . please see here for a very thorough clarification of the myth of the cholesterol myth by plant positive . start at “ 18 cholesterol confusion 1 primordial prevention ” and go on from there. http : / / plantpositive.com / 18-cholesterol-confusion-1-pri / i contend all studies involving eggs are flawed . are they using eggs from standard hatcheries that produce subpar eggs whos hens who have never seen the sun or eaten grass & insects or eggs from a free range hatchery where the hens get sunshine , green grass ( yes hens eat grass too ) , bugs , etc . there is a huge difference in the eggs . now take a standard hatchery egg and fry it on a hot skillet with oil . the lecithin in the egg yolk ( which there is very little in a standard hatchery egg ) is destroyed and you are left with cholesterol , but not just cholesterol , but radically changed cholesterol that has been heated to 400 degrees more and swimming in heated oil . i think most eggs in these studies are consumed fried instead of the healthier poached , boiled or soft boiled . a healthier cooked egg still has the lecithin intact which nature intended along with the cholesterol that hasn ’ t been overheated . a free range healthier egg has much more lecithin in the yolk to emulsify the fats in the egg . yes , fried eggs are bad for you because the high heat perverts the contents of the eggs . i contend boiled or poached free range eggs are not bad for you and your health and you will find no studies to ever disprove it . its still pretty old school to still think egg cholesterol is bad for you in all forms . cholesterol is not the problem . inflamation is the problem and the lack of nutritious fruits and vegetables to heal the damaged artery linings . never fry foods even vegetables.dan , there are some leaps in logic that are being made with your post.1 ) there are little meaningful nutrition

PLAIN-3170	melatonin & breast cancer for billions of years , life on the planet earth has evolved with about 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark . we discovered fire awhile ago , but have only been using candles about 5,000 years and electric lighting for only about a century . this is what the country used to look like . then 20 years later . 20 years more years . and then estimated about 20 years in the future . our skies used to look like this . now they look like this . the photo on the left was taken during a blackout . these days , this is the only milky way our children will likely ever see . but so what ? does it have an effect on our health ? — the light , not the candy bar . let ’ s find out . you may have heard that light at night increases breast cancer risk . is this fact or fiction ? well , two reviews were published last year assessing the existing evidence . electric light causes cancer ? surely you ’ re joking . well , let ’ s look at the evidence . smack dab in the middle of our brain is the pineal gland , the so-called “ third eye . ” and it ’ s got only one function : produce melatonin in the dark . it ’ s hooked up to our eyes and at dawn , the gland shuts down . then at night it turns back on . that ’ s how our internal organs know what time of day it is : they sense the level of melatonin in our blood stream . and melatonin is thought to suppress cancer growth , kinda like putting cancer to sleep at night . let ’ s test the theory : if that ’ s true , should blind women have more breast cancer or less breast cancer ? less , right ? because their pineal gland never gets turned off by the sun . and guess what ? blindness is indeed protective against breast cancer . cuts your risk in half . what about shift workers who work in the middle of the night ? increased risk , right ? melatonin production is interrupted . what if you live in neighborhood with really bright street lights . increased risk — they took satellite photos and the brighter neighborhoods seemed to correlate with greater breast cancer risk . anyways , fact , but what does this have to do with nutrition ? last year , for the first time ever , melatonin levels and food choices were studied . the harvard nurse ’ s study , found two foods significantly associated with melatonin suppression — like a bright light at night , which is bad . they looked at fruits , vegetables , nuts , bread , meat , and dairy . in which group were the offenders found ? both meat and dairy intake were associated with lower melatonin levels , which may help explain why they found that meat and dairy intake in adolescence was associated with breast cancer risk later in life . i wonder whether the data show any correlation between meat and dairy intake at other times of life ( not just adolescence ) and breast cancer risk.we know , based on studies of breast cancer risk due to exposure to ionizing radiation , for example , that since invasive breast tumors may take decades to manifest , dietary exposures during adolescence may be particularly important.there are many links between meat and dairy consumption and breast cancer . however i think the most compelling is the link between dairy and breast cancer . in studying the geographical occurance of breast cancer , researchers have found that in places where dairy is not part of the average diet like japan the incidence of breast cancer is very low . however they have also found that when japanese women migrate to high dairy consumption countries like the us and adopt the countries diet their breast cancer risk becomes the same as the average population . the link can not be clearer . do not put bovine breast milk into your body and reduce your breast cancer risk.i agree that we were designed to be weaned from milk as toddlers ( and stick to breasts of our own species ) but the latest meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies did not find a convincing relationship between cow ’ s milk consumption and breast cancer : i find that interesting , do you think that study is reliable ? the study differentiates between dairy products and milk suggesting that dairy products , reduce breast cancer risk but milk does not.i know of several studies including the harvard nurses study which show a link between meat and dairy consumption and breast and bowel cancers . two areas of the body which are affected by hormones , which high fat diets seem to increase in women . as well as the hormones in cows milk itself.there is also the research done by dr t. colin campbell . where he could turn on and off the cancer in rats by regulating the amount of casein in their diet.it seems odd based on the number of studies i have seen sited that show a correlation that this study should find none.it isn ’ t “ a ” study , but a meta-analysis , meaning it ’ s an attempt to pool the results of multiple studies together , in this case ( as you can see in the above graphic ) more than a dozen . after pooling the results from these studies they did not find that milk intake was significantly associated with breast cancer risk ( in humans ) .does melatonin have an important interaction with other human diseases ? also be sure to check out my associated blog post breast cancer and diet ! dr. gregor – the colon is missing in the above link , creating a broken link ; ) thank you so much for pointing that out ! should be working noware melatonin supplements safe ? i take 5mg at night to help with falling asleep . do you know of any studies showing risk factors there ? in which plant food can we find melotanine ? are supplements safe ? thanks julieraspberries . dr. gregger has a link for this information.tart cherries have a high amount . but the best way to boost it is to get into a good sleep rhythm and to make sure your room is black when you sleep . between 10pm and 2am is when the body produces a lot , so the earlier to bed , the better . ( right now its midnight ! what with electricity. computers and the internet , and a job that finished late , its hard to stick to early nights ! ! ) emfs are also said to interrupt melatonin production , so if that were the case , it would be good to turn everything off and put cell phones in airplane mode.i ’ ve been a full time night nurse for more than twenty years of my career . i am obese and i can ’ t help but notice that some of the others nurses are too . until they realize my contribution to the team , the day staff think i ( we ) are fat because we must be lazy but i know i am definitely not lazy . i am awake during my nights off even if i am awake all day . i am close to retirement . i know there is a link between obesity and breast cancer ( as well as ther types of cancer ) . what can i expect for my retirement in terms of sleep pattern changing back to the ‘ norm ’ and breast cancer risk ? there seems to be a link between night shift workers and obesity … … and a link between obesity and breast cancer … how does melatonin factor in ? unfortunately , many of us ate the meat and dairy our parents fed us as adolescents . i am 39 and eating a whole foods plant based diet . but i know that my risk of breast and other cancers are still elevated . are there any other protective measures that you recommend ? you might find dr christine horner a useful resource : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = i _ yrmhw2kv0hello , some important dietary steps to ward off cancer would include consuming amla http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ? s = amlaflax http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / flax-seeds / and soy products http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / soy / consume healthy vegetables will also help ward off cancer. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / 1-anticancer-vegetable / the only significant association was the lower morning melatonin levels found in red meat consumers . dairy did not show a significant effect although dairy cream consumed by women subjects showed a minor association . fish and poultry did not seem to have a lowering effect on the melatonin levels in the study . very interesting study . i hope more are done on this interesting subject . the book , “ lights out , ” contains lots of information about lights at night effects on melatonin production for readers interested in this topic. adolescence , animal products , blindness , bread , breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , cancer , dairy , evolution , meat , melatonin , nuts , pineal gland , sleep , sunlight , vegetables , women 's health there are components of our diet that may increase cancer risk by mimicking the role of light pollution in melatonin suppression . more recent videos on the connection between animal products and breast cancer include : cholesterol feeds breast cancer cells estrogenic cooked meat carcinogens which dietary factors affect breast cancer most ? breast cancer survival , butterfat , and chickenplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on melatonin . also , there are 1,686 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well ! for some context , please check out my associated blog posts : breast cancer and diet , mushrooms for breast cancer prevention , and breast cancer & alcohol : how much is safe ?
PLAIN-3180	is kimchi good for you ? we know that vegetables reduce cancer risk , but what about fermented vegetables ? kimchi , a korean dish usually made out of fermented cabbage . harmful , harmless , or helpful ? harmful , potentially doubling one ’ s risk of breast cancer . and may increase the odds of getting prostate cancer 10-fold — just a spoonful a day . this is one of the studies that changed my eating habits this year . it ’ s funny , everytime i come home from the medical library my family ’ s like “ what can ’ t we eat now . ” or they ’ re like “ hmm , why is there , parsley in everything all the sudden ? ” is there more information about this ? is this traditionally made kimchee rather than kimchee made in a manner similar to that of making sauerkraut ? for that matter what about sauerkraut and other pickles ? this was for traditional kimchi . i can ’ t find anything in the literature about sauerkraut either way , but i ’ ll definitely keep an eye out . it is high in sodium , so if you do eat it i would suggest moderating your intake.would really like to learn more about sauerkraut , as it ’ s a very tasty way to enjoy cabbage . the delicious spreewald brand ( “ mild ” version ) shows 480 mg sodium for a 125 gram serving . is this really bad ? i imagine there are lower salt options out there for this food … dr. weil ’ s website q & a library area has a positive review of this food yet warns about the salt levels . guess i ’ ll need to look into making my own . : ) most kimchi has a fish sauce added to it … .. this may be a contiributing factor to this research . as a vegetarian who thinks garlic is smelly and aweful , i make my own and hope that the jury is still out over vegetarian kimchithis is a shame.my thoughts exactly – used to eat the stuff all the time ! hm … … made with organic cabbages ? ? i wonder why ? ? please find evidence and reverse this decision : ) this is on my pubmed alert list.hi dr. greger , can you please site where you found this information precisely ? are they talking about kimchi / fermented foods made with white vinegar ? or are they made with salt and other spices ? i looked up pubmed and i am having trouble finding and understanding it as i am not learned in medical / scientific facts. thanks ! i ’ m so glad you asked ! if you look on this page , right under the video you ’ ll see a section called sources cited . if you click , it will open up and list the hyperlinked citations to all the sources i use for any of the videos on the site.that is something i feel very strongly about . nutrition information ( and everything else in medicine ! ) should be based on the best available science . thank you for giving me a chance to point out this feature of nutritionfacts.org for those that might have missed it.looking at the abstract for the first study on breast cancer , they only controlled for non-dietary risk factors and vegetable intake . what if those who eat more kimchi also eat more preserved meats ? it seems they wouldn ’ t have caught preserved meats as an independent risk factor in that study . i think the second study found a correlation between prostate cancer risk and all fermented foods . i don ’ t like to see fermented soy products included here , too ! i ’ m going to hope salt is a culprit , and i ’ ll keeping eating my tempeh … .doesn ’ t traditional kimchi also contain fermented fish ? could this have affected the results ? i am confused : i thought fermented vegetables were really good for the immune system and for fighting cancer . i have cancer , so i really need to know whether to eat them or not.mary jurmain , there are a variety of vegetables that help prevent cancer and in some cases reverse it . check out these few videos on what those foods are if you have not already. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / best-fruits-for-cancer-prevention / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / cancer-reversal-through-diet / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / 1-anticancer-vegetable / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / veggies-vs-cancer / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / cancer-fighting-berries-2 / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / plant-based-prevention / fermenting anything usually involves a preservative which in turn is almost always harmful . the studies do in fact point to pickling foods increasing cancer risk.good luckis the preservative youre talking about , salt ? i just want to be clear on this .. hi “ toxins ” ( hmm ! ? interesting nickname ! ) thanks for the references , which i will definitely watch again , but i already own and have watched all of dr. gregor ’ s videos , so chances are i have seen all of those clips . i know a fair amount about what i need to eat ; i just want to have a very good reason if i ’ m going to eliminate something else from an already rather restrictive diet ( and also before i throw away 30 quarts of fermented green tomatoes ) . i seem to recall reading something about a study that showed sauerkraut prevented h1n1 from spreading in chickens , or something similarly bizarre . i ’ ve read sandor katz ’ s book “ wild fermentation ” , in which he talks about how his diet , heavy on fermented foods , has kept him healthy for years in spite of aids . and fermented vegetables have a long tradition in many cultures . it ’ s not that i can ’ t be convinced that they ’ re unhealthy , but if i ’ m going to accept data that goes against the grain of thousands of years of human history and a fair amount of anecdotal data , i ’ d like more than one study to convince me ; i ’ d like multiple studies and an explanation of the mechanism by which these foods do harm . i hope dr. gregor will weigh in on this debate.first of all , a big thanks to you , dr. greger , for providing us with this fascinating website . i love it and check it frequently . i was very sad to hear your report of the research regarding kimchi . kimchi is made with cabbage , garlic and hot peppers . it sounds like it couldn ’ t be healthier ! what aspect of it might contribute to cancer risk ? is occasional eating of canned saurkraut ( a few tbs once or twice weekly ) , made with cabbage , salt and maybe vinegar probably unwise ? also : i typically prepare a salad once a week , such as cucumber salad ( made with onions , dill , cucumbers , salt , lemon juice , two packets of stevia , and a little olive oil ) . then i eat a little bit each day with fresh lettuce , peppers etc . do you think this unhealthy because the cucumber salad is not made fresh daily ? ( it is the only stevia i have all week . ) thanks ! i make fermented veggies with body ecology culture starter . i add no salt or vinegar to my fermented veggies . do you know any scientific information on eating this type of fermented veggies ? i do make sauerkraut with salt , but keep it raw with no vinegar.thanks , debi understand for most koreans it ’ s not a meal unless there ’ s kimchee on the table.is there a high rate of prostate cancer in korea ? well dr i am ashamed that u call yourself a doctor and dont do all your research like most doctors .. traditionally prepared kimchi is made from raw cabbage and when fermented properly contains probiotics .. u can do some google searching and find out how beneficial probiotics are for us .. as a matter of fact , human life as we know it would not exist if it was not for probiotics … the probiotics found in kimchi and other naturally fermented vegetables ( sauerkraut , pickles , etc . ) create by-products like organic acids ( helps to preserve veggies and has alkalizing effects on the body ) and more enzyme content ( easier to digest and better absorption of nutrients ) .most doctors don ’ t do any research nor do most doctors care for the subject of diet ! nobody here is doubting the benefits of intestinal flora . dr. greger has two cited sources showing that pickling food has a negative impact on our health , could you please cite some sources that show otherwise ? thank you jane ! my exact thoughts as well ! hi dr greger what do you think about gochujang ? plus ! fermented foods , have been used thru the ages to prevent and sometimes even cure illness . for example , sauerkraut was used by the germans and europeans to prevent scurvy … due to its high concentrations of vitamin c it helps warn off illnesses like scurvy.vitamin c is abundant in the plant world and eating a fermented food is not necessary to acquire this easily available nutrient.xxjane42xx – please cite your sources , rather than just spout conjecture . if you ’ ll notice , the information presented in the video is attributed to specific scientific studies . what is your information based on ? my wife is korean and her family , ancestors , and everyone i know have been eating kimchi for ages … … not one of them has ever had breast cancer . i think you should search and find out more information . i couldn ’ t find any sources to support the video which he stated . if you click on the sources cited link up above you ’ ll find the sources linked there . * ahem * “ the mechanism of deleterious effects of preserved foods remains unclear ” . i need to see why and how kimchi can cause an increased chance of cancer .. then ill believe the video. and doesnt one of youre sources claim that cancer is reported to be lower in asian countries than it is in western countries ? there are a number of studies that have found potential mechanisms ( e.g. mutagenic substances produced via fermentation , there just haven ’ t been the studies , animal studies / clinical trials etc , to determine this for sure ) .nitrite and secondary amines are formed with fermentation : 1 . nan hm , park jw , song yj , yun hy , park js , et al . : kimchi and soybean pastes are risk factors of gastric cancer . world j gastroenterol 11 , 3175 – 3181 , 20052 . seel dj , kawabata t , nakamura m , ishibashi t , hamano m , et al . : n-nitroso compounds in two nitrosated food products in southwest korea . food chem toxicol 32 , 1117 – 1123 , 19943 . mitacek ej , brunnemann kd , suttajit m , martin n , limsila t , et al . : exposure to n-nitroso compounds in a population of high liver cancer regions in thailand : volatile nitrosamine ( vna ) levels in thai food . food chem toxicol 37 , 297 – 305 , 1999.4 . yuan z and ding y : mutagenesis and anti-mutagenicity in several traditional zhejiang preserved foods . carcinogen teratogenmutagen 15 , 91 – 93 , 2003 . … there are also many studies about the risks of salt and the nutritional deterioration of acid-preserved foods . many of these studies also control for confounding variables which explain the lower overall cancer rates in asian countries.dr greger ’ s recommendations are based on risk-aversioni think it might be premature to suggest eliminating all pickled vegetables from your diet based on these two studies , and a cursory review of the literature which indeed provides further evidence for an increased risk of esophageal , gastric and other cancers . most studies having been done in asia on relatively small numbers of subjects where the average consumption of pickled vegetables is high may have produced results that would not be seen elsewhere . indeed , the prostate study demonstrates higher likelihood of getting prostate cancer in those eating the highest quartile of pickled vegetables , which is well above what i believe would be the norm for most americans , with no suggestion of a dose response curve . therefore , it might be more appropriate to suggest avoiding high intake levels of pickled vegetables and admit that we don ’ t have enough data to determine the effect of lower levels of intake . however , i agree that until health benefits of pickled vegetables are proven , they should not contribute a large percentage of vegetable consumption.also be sure to check out my associated blog post breast cancer and diet ! i was wondering if you had any information on capers ? the kind you find pickled in jars . i ’ ve heard the berry is high in antioxidants but then i only see them sold pickled , and it seems that this might not be a good thing . thanks for all of your hard work ! ! i couldn ’ t read the yu study , so i didn ’ t know if they differentiated between vegan and non-vegan ( e.g. , shrimp paste , anchovy , fish paste ) ; traditional kimchi in korea isn ’ t vegan.as a vegan who has finally found a source of vegan kimchi , this information – if true – makes me sad.http : / / www.health.com / health / article / 0 , , 20410300,00.htmlkinda conflicts with mainstream theories of whether it healthy ? i thought that eating fermented foods helps with dysbiosis ? are the raw / salt-free sauerkrauts ok to eat ( like rejuvenative foods brand ) ? could dr greger or joseph gonzales answer bee ’ s question please – i also would like to know the answer to this and , if they are ok to eat , in what amounts and frequency would be considered healthy ? no studies i am aware of look at the kind of products you describe and it ’ s role on dysbiosis . this review may offer some insight . if you eat fermented foods like sauerkraut i suggest keeping intake low and yes a salt-free version perhaps is better . i have never seen those but another site user posted about it in a recent video . let me know if you want me to find the comment maybe you guys can connect ? ps : i have replied to all other question you had on kimchi . i hope the are helpful.thanks , benj josephi checked out this site and it says that korea had low prostate cancer rates but as they become more westernized their rates are increasing. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16741923this comparison of prostate cancer death rate by country http : / / www.worldlifeexpectancy.com / cause-of-death / prostate-cancer / by-country / lists the u.s. is 103 whereas south korea , the birthplace of kimchi , is low at 165 . i look forward to learning more on this because i make my own kimchi and i love it.seems like some studies are schlock-fermented and organic foods are still healthy to consume . i sometimes really question the surdies you accept as fact … jesus christ . is is so bad ? i think this biased video forgot to mention that kimchi is rich in vitamin a , thiamine ( b1 ) , riboflavin ( b2 ) , calcium , and iron , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] and contains a number of lactic acid bacteria , among those the typical species lactobacillus kimchii . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] health magazine named kimchi in its list of top five “ world ’ s healthiest foods ” for being rich in vitamins , aiding digestion , and even possibly reducing cancer growth . [ 20 ] ( wikipedia ) if anything , just look at the difference between the obesity levels between usa and korea . _ .i don ’ t know where you found the information or the idea that kimchi increases the probability of breast cancer . neither do i know how familiar you are with the food itself . but i do want to point out to you that first of all , koreans have been eating kimchi for centuries ; however , studies have shown that only recently ( since the early 1990s ) have breast cancer incidents been steadily increasing . if koreans have been eating kimchi for centuries , why should this problem start arising now ? maybe instead of targeting kimchi specifically , look at the broader picture and trends . for example , did you know that the increase in cancer incidents coincides with the timing that western diets were introduced to korea ? moreover , not only breast cancer but cancer rates in general has increased in korea after the introduction of western diet . and something else i think you should know . according to breast cancer statistics in korea , despite the increase of breast cancer incidents , korea still has lower breast cancer incidents ( 26.2 per 10000 ) compared to the world average of 37.4 per 100000.i think dr greger does us a great service by informing us of the latest dietary research . however quickly leaping to conclusions and giving broad recommendations based on insufficient research , or a very narrow interpretation of that research is a big problem in what he does , it discredits everything he says , and this video is a perfect case in point.based on two small korean studies , he ’ s telling people to never eat kimchi because he thinks it will cause cancer . i looked at the studies and they do not seem tightly controlled or conclusive at all , and have no mechanism proposed ( as others have pointed out ) .i am increasingly taking all of dr greger ’ s recommendations with a grain of salt ( and in this case , a lot of salt , along with some fermented vinegar .. ) hrmm … interesting … .not. http : / / www.health.com / health / article / 0 , , 20410300,00.htmlworld ’ s healthiest foods : kimchi ( korea ) i tend to believe there are additional factors involved besides people consuming more pickled vegetables . perhaps the people consuming them made them in a certain way that created scum or mold ? or with certain ingredients like fish , contaminated seaweed , dairy ? i do not know these specifics . i do know that i am a vegetarian / vegan for 25 years who has fallen in love with healthy fermented vegetables including sauerkraut and kimchi ( which i make myself ) . why do i mention “ healthy ” ? because what most people do , and is “ tradition ” , is to use a german or polish type ceramic pickling crock . these may be traditional but they usually allow air in them which creates scum or mold and people think it is healthy and beneficial to simply “ skim off ” the scum or mold and the rest is healthy to eat ( yuk ) . what they are making is “ rotten ” vegetables . healthy “ fermented ” vegetables should have no foul odor that smells rotten . i use a fermenting vessel that is fool proof if you follow directions carefully . the http : / / www.pickl-it.com is made of glass and it keeps the air out. namaste ; , racheldon ’ t believe everything you hear on the internet , there are so many disinformation out there.kimchi and other fermented vegetables contains essential probiotics which everybody nowadays ( in chemical loaded environment ) are lacking of.however on the opposite side , fermented vegetables contains acetaldehyde compound which can be detrimental to our health if consumed in large quantity . therefore fermented food is a double edge-sword , it is good to our health if consumed in moderation , but bad if we overconsumed.the notion of kimchi is bad overall and must be avoided is ludicrous , our ancestors had been fermenting vegetables for thousands of years before the invention of refrigerator . how else can they eat their vege during winter months ? if kimchi is bad overall , one must question , “ how to these koreans , survived 2000 years of kimchi without dropping dead all over from breast cancer ! ? ? ? ? ” and what would you say about this article : http : / / online.liebertpub.com / doi / abs / 10.1089 / 10966200360716544 ? however , i think it ’ s a great source of information , but it may be that some fermented veggies ( especially kimchi ) would have a very different risk associations with the cancers and other health issues , depending on the context of the study as there are a lot of cancer types . i mean that according to some research they can slow or even inhibit some types of cancer , on the contrary , other research may prove that it ’ s completely different with other cancers.this seems to directly oppose your conclusions and is very indepth study . better than some of the studies you cited , in fact … it ’ s google-able.dietary factors and gastric cancer in korea : a case-control studyhyun ja kim1 , woong ki chang2 , mi kyung kim1 , sang sun lee3 , bo youl choi1 , † , * article first published online : 2 nov 2001doi : 10.1002 / ijc.10111someone just showed me this article : http : / / articles.latimes.com / 2006 / may / 21 / world / fg-kimchi21not all fermented foods are pickled and not all pickles are fermented . if you buy kimche in a jar , it may not have been fermented ( no probiotics ) , may have been pasteurized ( no probiotics ) , and will probably have preservatives . i wish this study had made fermented kimche to compare to the store bought.http : / / www.thehealthyhomeeconomist.com / the-crucial-difference-between-pickled-and-fermented / go to the grocer and try to find a jar of pickles , kimche or sauerkraut that is also fermented and doesn ’ t have preservatives . it ’ s nearly impossible . these studies did not look at traditional kimche because it was not fermented . if you want to look at benefits of true fermented veggies , it would be best to disregard this study because it only looks at preserved foods . who wants to eat that ? ! i ’ m reposting a comment from another thread since i agree with you and think the topic is treated too superficially on this site – i ’ d really like to see it explored a bit more : i ’ m keen on fermented plant-based foods like miso , natto , amazake , kombucha , homebrew beer and lacto-fermented veggies – i think it may be a bit oversimplistic to lump all these together , see http : / / kimchicancer.blogspot.c … which notes a protective effect for some fermentates and a cancer increased risk with others , e.g. radishes.fact is , once a fermented food is jarred or canned under heat , the probiotics are killed and it it is worthless as a source of them , preservatives or not . also , i think it needs to be reiterated that “ pickling ” can refer to simply adding vinegar to ingredients , again , rendering a food worthless as a source of probiotics ! cultured , lacto-fermented vegetables indeed have a long and illustrious history and regardless of what a few recent questionable studies show , i ’ ve been consuming them for my 60 + years and will continue to , especially in light of the newish volumes of info ( and lots of personal experience ) regarding the importance of the microbes in our gut as our “ second brain ” . like anything else , be moderate , a good overall diet is the most important thing ! sad face ! i love kimchi , assumed since it was cabbage with spices that it would be good for you . : ( http : / / www.humanewatch.org / hsus _ doc _ exposed _ as _ schlock / enough said.not enough said for me . the article you linked to is simply a reminder of how easy it is to attack another person on the web . it is one thing to disagree and present scientific evidence but it is another thing to call people names and just slam other well meaning organizations that do base their work on research with significant improvement in people ’ s lives . even the harriet hall in her article linked to at science-based medicine has “ cherry picked ” , didn ’ t stick to facts , used gross generalizations , omissions when citing a study and veered off from scientific objectivity . would harriet hall md actually speak to michael greger md , c. esselstyn md , neal barnard md , dean ornish md , john mcdougall md , etc. that way or tone – i can bet not.the causes of cancer are still a mystery , so just take this ‘ research ’ with a ‘ grain of salt ‘ ! wondering if the chile pepper ingredient could be a factor . though it ’ s been shown to have anti-cancer properties , a 2010 study showed capsaicin to be carcinogenic for skin cancer : http : / / www.sciencedaily.com / releases / 2010 / 09 / 100902121057.htmas for sauerkraut , anyone concerned about it having too much sodium can make their own with potassium chloride.i wonder if the fish content of kimchi has anything to do with the formation of carcinogens . i just made a huge batch of vegan kimchi and wonder if i should throw it out now . i wish i had found this video first ! don ’ t throw it out ! people have been eating this for thousands of years ! there may be more to these studies than meets the eye or else it would have been apparent long ago ! seriously , think about it ! even too much water can kill you ! relax … it ’ s a condiment , not a daily meal ! this would suggest that non-preserved fermented foods can provide beneficial bacteria , without increasing cancer risk . kombucha is too risky , how about vegan yogurt or kefir ? there is evidence for the benefit of fermented food , but now against preservation . perhaps due to salt or acidity ? “ what can ’ t we eat now ? ” , “ why is there parsley in everything all of a sudden ? ” rotfl ! * good healthy laughs * : ) hi dr greger . are there any studies on gochujang ? is it okay to still use it ? does this mean pickles and sauerkraut are bad for you ? if not , what ’ s the difference ? i am curious if there is any more information on pickled and fermented products on this website . i can see that kimchi and kombucha aren ’ t too good for you . i can also see that pickling food may not be great . is there such thing as a healthy pickled item ? also , what fermented products are good for you ? i saw that tempeh was quite healthy ( and it ’ s fermented ) . thank you kindly.apple cider vinegar is still okay , but don ’ t mess with the pills . are kimchi and sauerkraut harmful ? it seems a little bit of sauerkraut is okay , but there is not much research . lastly , i like this powerpoint from a dietitian from the fred hutchinson cancer center in seattle presenting at aicr on fermented and picked foods on cancer risk . yes , tempeh is fermented and very healthful . the problem with pickles and sauerkraut is their salt content . perhaps limiting these foods would be a good idea ? if i come across more research i ’ ll post here.perhaps related , these studies on the relationship between kimchi and gastric cancer risk point out that not all varieties of kimchi have a positive correlation with cancer . ( i ’ m hoping that my own home-fermented vegetables are beneficial ) : https : / / cancerkimchi.wordpress.com / cancer and kimchi by dr. joseph c kim “ … different types of kimchi and stomach cancer “ there are many different types of kimchi . let ’ s look at these 3 types and see how they are linked to gastric cancer : baiechu kimchi ( prepared with salted chinese cabbage and red pepper , etc . ) , kkakduki ( a kind of kimchi prepared with salted radish and red pepper , etc . ) , dongchimi ( a kind of kimchi prepared with radish and a large quantity of salt water ) to assess gastric cancer ( gc ) risk in relation to dietary intake in korea , a case-control study was performed . trained dietitians interviewed 136 patients diagnosed with gc , and the same number of controls were selected by matching sex , age and hospital . a significant decrease in gc risk was observed with increased intake of baiechu kimchi ( prepared with salted chinese cabbage and red pepper , etc . ) , baiechu kimchi-stew , garlic , mushroom and soybean milk . on the contrary , a significant increase in the risk of gc was observed with increased intake of cooked rice with bean , charcoal grilled beef , pollack soup , kkakduki ( a kind of kimchi prepared with salted radish and red pepper , etc . ) , dongchimi ( a kind of kimchi prepared with radish and a large quantity of salt water ) and cooked spinach . in food groups , increased intake of soybean products was associated with decreased risk of gc . intake of citrus fruits rather than total fruits was shown to have a protective effect on the risk of gc , but was not significant . in this study , intake of total vegetables was shown to have a protective effect , whereas high nitrate-containing vegetables increased the risk of gc . in conclusion , our study suggests that the risk of gc decreased with high consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits , whereas high consumption of foods rich in nitrate and carcinogenic substances produced during the cooking process increased the risk of gc . ” also : “ … nitrate levels are high in kimchi . the full article can be found here : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2766547 / “ breast cancer , breast disease , breast health , cancer , cruciferous vegetables , fermented foods , kimchi , men 's health , natural toxins , nutrition myths , probiotics , prostate cancer , prostate health , vegetables , women 's health epidemiological evidence that kim chi consumption may significantly increase cancer risk . for some more recent videos on fermented foods , see : bacterial vaginosis and diet dead meat bacteria endotoxemia carcinogenic putrescineplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on kimchi . also , there are 1,686 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well ! for some context , please check out my associated blog posts : soymilk : shake it up ! and breast cancer and diet .
PLAIN-319	bowel movements : the scoop on poop years ago we learned that those eating plant-based diets are just “ regular ” people . in a study comparing omnivores , vegetarians , and vegans profiled in my bowel movement frequency video , researchers found a “ very clear trend towards an increasing number of bowel movements with a more rigorous degree of vegetarianism . ” for example , even meat-eating women who piled on the fruits and veggies and ate the same amount of fiber had only a quarter the odds of having a daily bowel movement compared to women eating vegan . but does this translate to decreased disease risk ? this year marks the 40th anniversary of the publication of painter and burkitt ’ s landmark paper “ diverticular disease of the colon : a deficiency disease of western civilization ” ( pdf here ) . just as scurvy is a vitamin c deficiency disease , they argued , diverticulosis is a fiber deficiency disease , the result of not eating whole plant foods . no surprise , then , that the majority of older americans are afflicted with this condition . as i explain in my diverticulosis video , a lifetime of straining to pass stools that aren ’ t softened and bulked up by fiber can eventually balloon pockets out through the weakest points in the wall of our colons . these bulging outpouchings can get inflamed , infected , and even lead to a life-threatening rupture of our intestines . more than 100,000 americans are hospitalized every year for this preventable condition . this summer , a team of scientists at oxford released the results of a study ( pdf here ) in which 15,000 vegetarians and vegans were followed for nearly a dozen years . compared to meat eaters , vegetarians had 35 % less risk of being hospitalized or dying from diverticulitis , and those eating vegan appeared to eliminate 78 % of the risk . what ’ s most surprising is that even after controlling for fiber intake , those on plant-based diets still had significantly lower risk , leading the researchers to suggest that meat itself may increase the risk of diverticular disease “ by altering the metabolism of bacteria in the colon , which could lead to a weakening of the colon wall … . ” in addition to enhanced regularity , vegetarians and vegans also get points for achieving the preferred stool size and shape . the bigger the better . for example , one reason why women eating vegetarian may have lower breast cancer rates is because they have larger bowel movements , the topic explored in last friday ’ s video , relieving yourself of excess estrogen . on monday , stool size matters offered a tip on how to use beets to measure one ’ s intestinal transit time , and tuesday ’ s food mass transit revealed that it may take an average of four days for food to get from one end to the other in women eating a standard american diet , too slow to meet the target half-pound-minimum fecal output for optimal cancer prevention . yesterday ’ s bowels of the earth contest revealed which country has the largest average stool size ( i.e. who ’ s # 1 at number 2 ) , and which population has the smallest ( new yorkers ! ) . please feel free to leave any questions you may have about this entry below , and feel free to check out all the videos on fiber as welli ’ m a retired physician who has heard you speak a couple of times and enjoy your material and approach but i ’ m a fast reader and would like to read your material . how can i do this.hi dr. gregor , i suffer from pelvic floor dysfunction ( i think ) and have no issue with transit time as per a recent sitz marker test . what i do experience though is an intense pain over my right eye when i cannot have a bowel movement . also , i have virtually no sensation in my rectum . might you know what is causing my difficulties or what i can do to help ? i am vegan and have been for over 3 years.off topic i know doctor , but i wanted to know if you can help offer direction on getting off of my blood pressure medicine . i only take a low dose , but when i stop , my blood pressure does go up into a borderline range . i am vegan , and do regularly eat red lentils . thanks in advance ! bananas , 20 a day , blended with berries and flax ( ground ) seeds , dates as snacks and any other whole fruit or veggie . every night eat a handful of pecans with a one-pound salad consisting of purple cabbage , kale , broccoli and spinach . eat more if you can . use a fat-free dressing like catalina . give it a month and you ’ ll be off your meds . see your doctor before stopping your prescription . get off slowly ; lots of that stuff can have serious withdrawals.hi david , i ’ d have to know a little more about your diet and exercise habits to give you a more detailed answer , but off the top of my head : are you watching your sodium intake http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok processed foods are one of the worst offenders as far as sneaking sodium into your diet . vegan cheeses and meat substitutes are loaded with the stuff . regular exercise is also one of your best weapons against high blood pressure.any opinions on aloe vera juice ? a recent randomized , cross-over , placebo-controlled study failed to find any benefit of aloe vera over placebo in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome . there is , however , evidence that peppermint oil may help . in general , the available science suggests that the purported benefits of aloe are overblown , and given recent reports of aloe-induced hepatitis , i would recommend against ingesting it . applied topically , though , to second degree ( blistering ) burns , aloe vera does seem to accelerate healing . thank you so much for your question – i ’ m always happy to look things up for folks.this is all very interesting ! what about personal “ experience ” of the tmi kind ? my personal experiences differ from the results of these studies.ready for a little tmi ? ok , a lot of tmi ? : ) a few years ago , i decided to head toward vegetarianism . i also started eating very healthy – organic , local , fresh , homemade , etc . – and quit smoking . i took up a “ flexitarian ” diet , consisting of no meat on most days and small amounts of meat once or twice a week.at some point during that time , i also developed a rectocele ( unbeknownst to me until a few months ago ) . the last year and a half , i was feeling increasingly constipated , stools were difficult to pass and yet rather thin . of course , cancer was my fear . then i discovered the rectocele . i decided to up the fiber even more , via grains , veg and inulin . things became even more difficult . i was having the urge to defaecate every day , several times a day , but it was far from easy.this past month , i had two house guests back to back . they are both meatetarians , to keep them happy , i cooked meat , just like back in my olden days when it was a slab of meat as the main and the rest as sides.and wouldn ’ t you know it , regular bowel movements ever since . no splinting , no straining . they are the right color , larger in size , etc.i really hate to cave to this and leave my dreams of being a vegetarian in the dust , but … . if i can avoid surgery for the rectocele i will . incidentally , wasn ’ t there a study recently revealed about the rather marked increase in colon cancer risk among vegetarians , perhaps due to the large amount of fiber and therefore the scraping of the intestines ( scraping releasing mucous , thus requiring healing followed by possible dna replication mistakes ergo cancer ) ? sorry to hear about the rectocele . there are many factors that go into the development of a rectocele as i ’ m sure you are aware . it is not unusual for the symptoms to be made worse by the increase in fiber and bulk of the stool . given your history it appears that you have two choices . the first to continue what you are doing to minimize the problems caused by the rectocele or to have the rectocele surgically repaired and to resume a whole food plant based diet . given the risks of the standard american diet as it relates to arterial disease , cancer , autoimmune disorders , obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and neurological disorders it would be easy to argue for the surgical repair with improved nutrition . i haven ’ t seen the study that you are referring to but all the studies i have seen and the current best hypothesis is that fiber reduces the risk of colon cancer when all the other variables are taken into consideration . as each case is unique it is important to work with your physician ( s ) to help you make the right decision for yourself . good luck.about 6 months ago , i switched to a plant-based diet but am having terrible diarrhea . i cannot eat anything “ healthy ” ( especially legumes , green leafy vegetables and berries ) without almost immediate diarrhea . i sometimes go on a bread / cheese / meat diet for a day or two , just to obtain relief of the diarrhea ! is this something normal , in your experience ? even after eating essentially plant-based for 6 months , the diarrhea does not seem to want to disappear . i have had stool tests and blood tests , all of which are normal . i ’ m so sad and confused … it seems like the world ’ s best diet , is turning out to be my worst nigthmare ! if you have any thoughts , i woudl be thrilled to read them . many , many thanks for your blog and videos which are truly fantastic , and very much appreciated.hey marilougarson , sorry to read about your diarrhea aka “ mudd butt ” . i know it sucks , literally . thanks for sharing with all of us . sounds like you might me getting too much fiber . i would be interested to know what your diet was on a typical plant-based day . also try consuming some probiotics ( no yogurt ) to boost your healthy gut bacteria . i ’ ve used gol ( garden of life ) raw probiotics and they did a fantastic job with regulating my digesting and relieving diarrhea constipation after a round of antibiotics or stomach buggreat article ! ! ! ! i ’ ve been vegan 3 weeks and notice the difference in many aspects of my health.dear dr greger , i have been vegetarian for about 25 + years and virtually vegan for about 5 years . i contracted prostate cancer some years ago ( i think ) although it was diagnosed dec 2012 ( gleason 3 + 4 ) . i have had a prostatectomy in march and am about to have radiation therapy but the medics have had me on the ct scanner four different times ( 4 hour round trip ) to set up the scanner and mark my pelvis area , but my bowel is never correct – too much gas or faeces . i used a de-gas pill and now they gave me laxatives ( 2 x 2 times a day ) which i took 1 x 2 times a day . i think the problem is timing because my bowel is very efficient and healthy , 1-2 movements every day , but they think i need laxatives.is a vegan bowel more likely than the average one to move waste in a continuing kind of process ? i had an enema last trip but they waited an hour before i went on the ct again . they told me the scan was fine on the day but now they rang to say there was too much faeces in it . i just want to get the scan right but i ’ m not sure laxatives are going to make any difference . any suggestions ? what about frequency ? i only go once a day and i would say it is large . just wondering if what people say about going after every meal is correct.hi dr . greger . i was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer metastatic to the liver . i am on a vegan diet and i go very often ( about 3-5 ) on bad days . my bowel is loose and sometimes i don ’ t feel complete evacuation . what can i do ? i have lost a lot of pounds and can ’ t gain weight on a vegan diet ( is that possible , i ’ m pooping more than i need to ? adirel : i ’ m so sorry to hear about your cancer . not only your cancer , but your other problems too.i ’ m not a doctor nor an expert , but i have seen some articles that address people who want to gain weight on a vegan diet . these articles suggested eating lots of calorie-dense , whole foods such as : nuts , seeds , avocados and maybe even olives . you can make all sorts of sauces and dips out of these foods . or even just load up on nut butters like peanut and almond butter . whether or not something counts as calorie dense or not might depend on a lot on your existing diet . if you are eating a lot of low-fat or fat-free salads and raw veggies , then just about anything would be higher calorie density – including say tofu.while you may not be a teen and / or an athlete , the following page may interest you . not all of the recommendations on the page are whole foods , but there are some good ideas that may help and it is a site ( vegetarian resource group ) that i trust. http : / / www.vrg.org / teen / veg _ athlete _ weight _ gain.phpsince i am not a doctor , i do not know if these suggestions are a good idea for your situation . i just thought you might find these ideas helpful.good luck.interesting. i thought it would be a no-brainer because of the fiber for plant-based dieters but even with plenty of that + eating protein slows it down . no wonder every time i turn my plant-based diet into a flexitarian diet i end up with smaller , more infrequent poo . i knew it was the protein but i don ’ t really eat that much . but it sure makes a difference . – good to know.hello dr.greger , when eating a plant based diet my increased bowel movements cause me to have to wipe so much that i begin to bleed , or there is already blood in my stool . i am a young male who does exercise and has been an athlete most of my life . how do i fix this , either through changing diet or through a certain type of bath tissue or etc . ? i dont think i can eat a plant based diet if i keep having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times a day ( # 2 ) thanksghee buttersnapssorry to read about your problem . going on a plant based diet does change the frequency and size of the stool … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / bowels-of-the-earth / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / food-mass-transit / . this requires some adjustments and 2-3 stools is typical for those on higher fiber diets . based on current science benefits far outweigh problems . that said , bleeding can be caused by local irritation , hemorrhoids and other conditions some serious so it is important to have the correct diagnosis before embarking on fixing the problem . having your regular provider check would be a good idea . if the problem is found to be due to local irritation you can look at changing the texture of tissue , avoiding tissue with chemicals , gently cleaning with plain water and soft cloths , and protecting the area with creams / ointments which help while avoiding making the problem worse . based on a proper diagnosis you and your provider should be able to come up with an approach that works for you and your circumstances . good luck. beets , bowel movements , breast cancer , colon , diverticulosis , fiber , meat , omnivores , painter and burkitt , stool shape , stool size , vegan , vegetarian - -
PLAIN-3190	obesity-causing pollutants in food the dramatic rise in obesity has been blamed on overeating and inactivity , but might it be something more ? i talked about the “ chicken obesity virus . ” scientists are also now identifying industrial chemical pollutants released into the environment in the last few decades that can disrupt our metabolism and predispose us to obesity . these pollutants have been called obesogens . the existence of chemical obesogens suggests that the prevailing paradigm , which holds that diet and decreased physical activity alone are the causative triggers for the burgeoning epidemic of obesity should be reassessed , which is what scientists are doing right now . the focus has been on these organotin compounds . basically they turn preadipocytes — pre-fat cells , into fat cells . how are we exposed ? through our diet . where are obesogens found the most ? beans , dairy , fish , fruit , grains , meat , nuts , or veggies ? there is actually some in conventionally grown fruits and veggies , because some of these chemicals are used as fungicides , but the # 1 dietary source is … fish . again , you hear the word pollutant , think fish , as our oceans have become humanity ’ s sewers . everything eventually flows down into the sea . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on persistent organic pollutants . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! consuming obesogens may also make your children , grandchildren , and great-grandchildren obese . at least if you are a rat in this study : manikkam , mohan , et al . “ plastics derived endocrine disruptors ( bpa , dehp and dbp ) induce epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of obesity , reproductive disease and sperm epimutations . ” plos one 8.1 ( 2013 ) : e55387. animal products , beans , body fat , dairy , exercise , fish , fruit , fungicides , grains , meat , nuts , obesity , obesogens , organotins , overeating , persistent organic pollutants , seafood , vegetables , weight loss , white meat chemical obesogens in the food supply may be contributing to the obesity epidemic . for more videos on industrial chemicals in food , watch these newer videos : food sources of perfluorochemicals dairy estrogen and male fertility california children are contaminated how fast can children detoxify from pcbs ? pollutants in salmon and our own fatplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on persistent organic pollutants . also , there are 1,686 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well ! for some context , please check out my associated blog post : boosting gut flora without probiotics .
PLAIN-32	peeks behind the egg industry curtain the american egg board is a promotional marketing board appointed by the u.s. government whose mission is to “ increase demand for egg and egg products on behalf of u.s. egg producers . ” if an individual egg company wants to run an ad campaign , they can say pretty much whatever they want . but if an egg corporation wants to dip into the 10 million dollars the american egg board sets aside for advertising every year , because the board is overseen by the federal government , corporations are not allowed to lie with those funds . this leads to quite revealing exchanges between egg corporations that want to use that money and the usda on what egg companies can and cannot say about eggs . thanks to the freedom of information act i was able to get my hands on some of those emails . of course a lot of what i got were pages with nearly all of the text blacked out ( you can see these in my video , who says eggs aren ’ t healthy or safe ? ) . but i did find some illuminating correspondence . for example , one email shows an egg company trying to put out a brochure on healthy snacking for kids . but because of existing laws against false and misleading advertising , the head of the usda ’ s poultry research and promotion programs reminds the company that eggs or egg products cannot be couched as being healthy or nutritious . “ the words nutritious and healthy carry certain connotations , and because eggs have the amount of cholesterol they do , plus the fact that they ’ re not low in fat , [ the words healthy and nutritious ] are problematic . ” this is the united states department of agriculture saying this ! however , the usda official helpfully suggests , “ i believe you can say something that ’ s just as strong if not stronger , that is ‘ naturally nutrient-dense . ’ ” why can we say eggs are nutrient-dense but not nutritious ? because there ’ s no legal definition of nutrient-dense . we can say twinkies and coca cola are nutrient dense , but legally , we can ’ t say something is nutritious unless it ’ s actually … nutritious . for example , the egg industry wanted to run an ad calling eggs a nutritional powerhouse that aids in weight loss . the usda had to remind the industry that they can ’ t portray eggs as a diet food because of the fat and cholesterol content . in fact , eggs have nearly twice the calories of anything that can be called “ low-calorie . ” “ nutritional powerhouse ” can ’ t be used either . fine , the industry said , they ’ ll move to plan b , and headline the ad “ egg-ceptional nutrition . ” they couldn ’ t say that either because , again , given the saturated fat and cholesterol you can ’ t legally call eggs nutritious . so the headline ended up as , “ find true satisfaction , ” and instead of weight loss they had to go with “ can reduce hunger . ” the usda congratulated them on their cleverness . yes , a food that when eaten can reduce hunger — what a concept ! they can ’ t even say eggs are “ relatively ” low in calories . can ’ t say eggs are low in saturated fat — they ’ re not . can ’ t say they ’ re relatively low in fat , they ’ re not . can ’ t even call them a rich source of protein , because , according to the usda , they ’ re not . it ’ s illegal to advertise that eggs pack a nutritional wallop , or that they have a high nutritional content . eggs have so much cholesterol , we can ’ t even say they “ contribute nutritionally . ” can ’ t say eggs are “ healthful , ” certainly can ’ t say they ’ re “ healthy . ” can ’ t even say eggs contribute “ healthful components . ” since we can ’ t say eggs are a healthy start to the day , the usda suggests a “ satisfying start . ” egg corporations can ’ t call eggs a healthy ingredient , but they can call eggs a “ recognizable ” ingredient . can ’ t truthfully say eggs are good for us , either . by law , according to the usda , the egg industry “ needs to steer clear of words like ‘ healthy ’ or ‘ nutritious . ’ ” for a food to be labeled “ healthy ” under fda rules , it has to be low in saturated fat ( eggs fail that criteria ) and have less than 90mg of cholesterol per serving ( even half an egg fails that test ) . for the same reason we can ’ t tout ice cream for strong bones , we can ’ t say eggs are healthy because they exceed the threshold for cholesterol . egg corporations aren ’ t even allowed to say things like “ eggs are an important part of a well balanced , healthy diet ” on an egg carton because it would be considered misleading according to the usda ’ s national egg supervisor , since eggs contain significant amounts of fat and cholesterol and therefore can contribute to the leading killer in the united states , heart disease . the industry can ’ t afford to tell the truth about the eggs , or even the hens that lay them . the industry crams five to ten birds in cages the size of a file cabinet their whole lives , but when providing footage to the media , the american egg board instructs , “ do not show multiple birds in cages — they look too crowded and open us up to activist criticism . ” not only is the industry barred from saying eggs are healthy , they can ’ t even refer to eggs as safe because more than a hundred thousand americans are food poisoned by salmonella from eggs every year . the egg board ’ s response to this egg-borne epidemic is that salmonella is a naturally occurring bacterium . an internal egg industry memo didn ’ t think that should necessarily be the key message , fearing that “ it may be counterproductive by implying there is no avoiding salmonella in eggs aside from avoiding eggs altogether . ” the food poisoning risk is why the american egg board can ’ t even mention anything but eggs cooked hard and dry . no soft-boiled , no over-easy , no sunny-side up — because of the salmonella risk . the american egg board ’ s own research showed that the sunny-side up cooking method should be considered “ unsafe . ” in light of bird flu viruses , both the white and yolk must be cooked firm . the vp of marketing for the egg board complained to the usda saying they ’ d “ really like to not have to dictate that the yolks are firm , ” and cites a washington post article saying runny yolks may be safe for everyone except pregnant women , infants , elderly , or those with chronic disease . it turns out it was a misquote — eggs can ’ t be considered safe for anyone . instead of safe , they can call eggs “ fresh , ” the usda marketing service helpfully suggests . but they can ’ t call eggs safe , and they can ’ t say eggs are “ safe to eat . ” they can ’ t even mention safety at all . wait a second , not only can eggs not be called healthy they can ’ t even be called safe ? says who ? says the united states department of agriculture . for more peeks behind the egg industry curtain see : i think i ’ ll stick with tofu scrambleso , with this recent change in lowing concerns about cholesterol from what you eat , does this mean the eggs industry is going to make claims on health that they previously couldn ’ t ? or is this reduction in concern for dietary cholesterol just a political thing ? we ’ ll see what claims they start making . regardless , it seems the egg industry is being deceptive when it comes to public knowledge . cholesterol guidelines are a subject that many researchers are debating . dr. greger discuss optimal cholesterol levels , here.thanks. i have seen that video before , in fact just shortly before the announcement by national nutrition advisory panel that dietary cholesterol isn ’ t a concern . in fact that report really created a conflict at home where i was pointing out how bad eggs really were , and then they came out with a report that said they are fine . do we know what study ( s ) the advisory panel was relying on for their decision ? hey mikeonraw . glad you saw that video ! have you seen any of the communication from dr. greger testifying at the dgfa meetings ? it was just a few days back . this may help . i think he is at 2 : 06 : 00 . another speaker is dr. barnard who address the issue at hand . he is probably like 15 min before dr. greger . he addresses the aha / acc report directly and dr. greger follows-up on it . hope that helps ! thanks for your comments ! josephgo dr. greger ! thanks for the link to this testimony . also , thanks for pointing out the times that dr. barnard and dr. greger spoke . i would not have had the patience to find that myself.nope , didn ’ t see testify but i will check it out tonight . thanks for the follow ups.dr. barnard is at 1 : 46 . thanks again.yea what about egg white … dr ornish oks them and has reversed cad with them in his first food group for reversal.does this include organic eggsperhaps . most studies fail to separate organic vs non-organic . they both probably have the same amount of cholesterol and saturated fat , as seen with grass-fed organic beef and conventional beef.don ’ t forget that just a few years ago the harvard physicians ’ study determined that that although infrequent egg consumption caused no detectable harm , eating just one egg a day would increase risk of both heart disease and all causes of mortality. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 18400720 in fact , there are thousands of other studies which say much the same thing , warning against regular consumption of eggs and cholesterol-bearing foods . how the nutritional advisory council can disregard all these studies and be so callously caviler with americans ’ health is beyond my comprehension . i ’ ll be maintaining my abstinence from animal products whether they or their sponsors in the food industry like it or not.what about egg whites ? yea what about egg white … dr ornish oks them and has reversed cad with them in his first food group for reversal.egg whites don ’ t have cholesterol . they still have protein , but lack fiber and antioxidants . not sure exactly how their protein relates to increased risk of igf-i , but animal protein may increase igf-i production.explorer : i ’ m not sure if you would get notified of this or not , but i posted about egg whites separately on this page . there are lots of compelling reasons to stay away from egg whites.thanks thea . you can always right click on a comment ( on the time ) and copy link address . you probably know that as you have been here a while : ) either way is fine . i appreciate your input.joseph : no , i did not know that . i always wondered how people did that . thanks ! in the united states , the vast majority of soybeans , 87 percent , are genetically modified organisms , also known as gmos , according to gmo compass . gmo soy is also found in up to 70 percent of food products in u.s. supermarkets , including cereals , breads , soy milk , pasta and meat.have fun with your tofu – i ’ ll stick with pastured duck eggs.seems most tofu i find is organic , hence , not made with gmo soy.hi charles . there is lots of info on gmo and soy in this video , if interested.thanks for your comments ! josephi thought high cholesterol foods were no longer a problem ? not that i want to eat eggs , but i tend toward high cholesterol and i ’ m still confused about it , sorry ! if we don ’ t get high cholesterol from dietary cholesterol , as they now say , then how do we get it ? saturated fat ? is it just in our genes ? hi susan , cholesterol guidelines are a subject that many researchers are debating . we ’ ve known for a long time saturated fats boost cholesterol more than just dietary cholesterol . dr. greger discuss optimal cholesterol levels , here.in practically all poultry farms retroviruses , which are closely related to mouse mammary tumor retrovirus ( mmtv ) , can be found . laying hens have a high rate of ovarian tumors , but such tumors are uncommon in hens less than 2 years old . oviductal and ovarian tumors are generally not differentiated , and genital tumors occur mainly in hens above the age at which most are slaughtered . in commercial poultry operations , hens are usually sacrificed after their first year as layers , aged between 22 and 24 months . battery-egg laying hens attract retroviruses of mice on the grain stocks . eggs are therefore permanently infected . retrovirus secreting mice also come into contact with free-range chickens . free-range chickens are often kept outdoors so that the risk of contamination through the pollution of food on the ground may be greater from mice feces . in the winter months , mice more than likely go to aviaries and poultry farms to collect scraps of food.virus bearing and virus-secreting mice , cereals , chicken feed , poultry infection , vertical transmission of retroviruses via eggs and processing of raw protein in bavarian cream and other confectionery products occur , man being the terminus . by consumption of undercooked egg- proteins , there is an increase of ovarian cancer , breast cancer and prostate cancer in humans.humans are commonly exposed to potentially oncogenic viruses that naturally infect and are frequently endemic in animals , which are part of the food chain , such as laying hens , chickens and eggs.this is ridiculous ! eggs have been eaten in the human diet since agriculture was developed , and probably before . there is nothing wrong with eating eggs . salmonella in eggs is from unhealthy living conditions , just avoid commercially grown and eat organic pasture raised . the world today is obsessed with “ what ’ s healthy ” that i believe they lost sight of what ’ s natural for our species and how we ’ ve developed into the master race over the last few million years , it wasn ’ t by watching cholesterol , counting calories and eating gmo / processed foods . – i don ’ t eat eggs because i had a stomach injury and can no longer digest them , but i do feed them to my family.thanks lena . you are certainly welcome to make any dietary choices as you see fit . dr. greger is simply reporting on the egg industry . he is not saying we should or should not eat eggs . you make great points and i appreciate your comments ! sincerely , josephlena : re : “ … what ’ s natural for our species … ” i agree with you on that point . but the devil ’ s in the details . how do you determine what is natural ? i can think of two good ways : 1 ) by looking at our biology , 2 ) by looking at which foods promote health and which foods promote disease.the problem with using history as your guide is that humans are not natural creatures in that we do lots of things , including eating , based on custom and availability , not biology . then add in that we have so many years worth of history over such a wide variety of geographies and thus availability of food , that you have to be very careful about what lessons you take from looking as specific populations that lived a long time ago . it ’ s not that you can ’ t learn any lessons . but it does mean that you can ’ t conclude much with the simple idea that humans have been eating eggs for a long time . so ? humans in some populations have been dieing of heart disease and cancer for a long time too ( while other populations avoid these diseases by eating extremely small amounts of eggs and other animal products ) . what humans have been doing for a time in and of itself is not a selling point.we do have answers to the two good ways of determining what is “ natural for our species ” . for a great primer on what our biology tells us concerning humans eating meat , check out : humans are naturally plant eaters http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / natural.htmland for what science tells us about which foods promote health vs promote disease , you are in the right place . keep watching videos and reading the articles . the more you take in , the more you will understand this point . good luck.for people asking about egg whites , here is a repost from me , where i quote other people : there are two problems with eggs , the yolk and the white . ( to paraphrase dr. barnard . ) according to wikipedia , here ’ s what ’ s in egg beaters : “ ” egg beaters is primarily egg whites with added flavorings , vitamins , and thickeners xanthan gum and guar gum . it contains no egg yolks . ” since egg beaters do not have egg yolks , the cholesterol issue is not in play . but egg whites are just as bad for you . dr. barnard talks about the problems that animal protein presents for kidney health . other experts talk about the ( strong in my opinion ) link between animal protein and cancer . the question scientists then want to answer is : is there a causal link ? if so , what is the mechanism by which animal protein might cause cancer ? if memory serves , dr campbell in the china study mentions several ways in which we think that animal protein causes and promotes cancer . here on nutritionfacts , you can get a great education on how animal protein is linked to the body ’ s over-production of a growth hormone called igf-1 . igf-1 helps cancer to grow . to watch the series about igf-1 , click on the link below and then keep clicking the “ next video ” link on the button to the right until you get through the bodybuilding video . then you will have seen the entire series. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop / and darryl recently reminded me about the methionine issue . egg whites have * the * highest concentration of methionine of any food : http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / foods-000084000000000000000.html ? categories = 1,18,9,0,13,14,5,4,42,16,17,15,6,3,2,11,7,19,21,12,10,8,22 dr. greger did a nice video showing the link between methionine and cancer . so , there are two clear pathways linking animal proteins , especially egg whites , to cancer. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / starving-cancer-with-methionine-restriction / darryl also pointed out that , “ … high methionine diets increase coronary risk in humans . in its associations with cardiovascular disease and other disorders , homocysteine may be functioning partly as a marker for the major culprit , excess methionine . ” http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0939475305001092and while i can ’ t find it right now , i believe that toxins has pointed out two other health issues with egg whites.dr. greger recently posted some videos on how animal protein can raise insulin levels . i ’ m not sure if that applies to egg whites or not . but here is one of the videos . i can ’ t find the other one. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / if-white-rice-is-linked-to-diabetes-what-about-china / with all of the information we have about the harmful effects of animal protein in general and egg white in particular , i think it ’ s best to stay away from egg white . why not get your protein from safe sources ? sources which are known to have lots of positive health effects and will naturally give you a balanced amount of protein ? ( ie : whole plant foods ) make sense ? is there any method of protecting the remaining pancreas in newly diagnosed diabetics ( nutritionally or lifestyle ) ? duwayne : i don ’ t know specifically about “ protecting the remaining pancreas ” . what i can say is that dr. barnard has had great success in reversing type 2 diabetes with a whole plant food based diet . ( i presume the success he has seen involved protecting the pancreas , but i ’ m not 100 % sure what you mean by that nor could i probably answer if i was . ) dr. barnard wrote a book , complete with recipes , on this very topic if you are interested in learning more : http : / / www.amazon.com / neal-barnards-program-reversing-diabetes / dp / 1594868107 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 _ twi _ 1 _ pap ?

does the vitamin c in hibiccus halps for the absorption of the green tea nutriants ? is it the new best beverge ? : ) thanks .. ! ! ! hmmm … just how big is the egg industry ? could their influence , ahem , have possibly swayed the recent “ cholesterol decision ” that will surely be another green light to gobble down still more tortured animals and their byproducts ? i agree strongly with your comment . there is a book on how to control cholesterol without diet . “ cholesterol control without diet . the niacin solution ” by w. b. parsons . for more than 50 years , controlling cholesterol has been easy , with the use of mega doses of niacin ( 2-3 grams a day ) . this has also been lampooned by big business and big pharmacy , as being unpractical . perhaps that is what the committee is trying to report . that high triglycerides , high ldl , low hdl , are all about a niacin deficiency . niacin therapy is no longer considered safe perhaps because of the flush and the risk of nausea if taking niacin without food . also , most people will have to step their way up to these doses , this is not considered practical by modern medicine . however , a vegan diet may not be as effective as the mega doses of niacin , or maybe as effective . it seems that big business wants to have it all the way around . surely the dairy industry , egg industry , and meat industry are horrified by the benefits of less meat consumption . surely they would encourage people to use niacin therapy to aid their blood test results . did you know that nearly 2 / 3 of americans have a milk intolerance ? i was surprised to find myself among them ( i found i am a candidate for lactaid treatment , though ) , and i feel better when i eat less meat i am sure vegetarians at this site would love to present an alternative , which is also sunk by the modern money making machine , niacin therapy can extend life of those with unhealthy diets and taking chromium picolinate may blunt any igf-1 spike from eating animal protein.i am another one who cannot stomach milk , and have disliked it since i was a small child . my mom and i did daily battles over it because in the late 50 ’ s you did not question authority , and mom ruled ! lol ! i used to give away my school milk to a friend who promised he wouldn ’ t tell ! i know this is disgusting , but for me it was like swallowing mucus ! as i got older , i found i was lactose intolerant , no surprise there , and no tears either ! i never liked meat either so being vegan works for me in a myriad of ways ! i am healthier now than i was 20 years ago , and certainly lighter ! even being vegan , my cholesterol tends to be on the high side , so i do take niacin , i just have to watch the dosage because of the flushing ! thanks ! dr , abram hoffer found that niacin can cure a myriad of mental disorders , including schizophrenia , some depression , anxiety , most kinds of addiction , and bipolar disorder in the early 1950s and six years later he found that this miracle drug is good for blood chemistry as well . men and women who have done niacin therapy for heart disease probably have very good emotions . prescription niacin has been proscribed to many people without any concerns for over 70 years . the american psychological association tried to discredit him and his journal in the 1970s , a decision that still stands to this day and to wikipedia . he has treated thousands of patients successfully with the premise that they have a deficiency . the apa said that if patients respond to one gram of niacin , possibly even for addiction , they had pellagra and were downgraded as being never mentally ill . perhaps this is true . perhaps one fourth of americans have chronic pellagra and not mental illness and one third get this in each year . niacin is stripped from our whole grains in refineries and we are supposed to eat 6-11 servings of this a day . perhaps this was good too , we have more protein from milk , which has been good for mankind for the past 100 years . speaking as a botanist , fertilizer for plants ( is fertilizer cheating ? ) is just mineral nutrition , elements . what if there was fertilizer for people ? according to abram hoffer , there is , and he worked to established what would fertilize people for different diseases . this is called orthomolecular medicine . it is as alternative as nutrition therapy like that found at this site , but as profoundly beneficial . main stream medicine , like that for cancer , involves using steroids , which are a kind of fertilizer , and radiation therapy , which in a way is a kind of addition that nutrition therapy harnesses , there are poisons in plants to foreign bodies called phytonutrients . congratulations on your many years as a vegan . would you be surprised to learn that americans are deficient in many elements on average ? i think it is possible to say of the 20-60 nutrients that are essential , that is , must be eaten , cannot be made by the body like niacin and vitamin c , americans are deficient in most of them and these deficiencies are building in the form of chronic illness .. the eggstraordinary lengths the egg industry resorts to polish the image of their beloved product of chicken menstruation borders on chickanery.food is hazardous too health ! do not eat ! ! manage your risk , and eat the less hazardous foods.i am a first grade teacher and everyday my students , all public school students , are exposed to every food group that you fight so hard to expose and discourage . i see the results of “ food poisoning ” every week . students have all the symptoms of consuming unhealthy meals and results are found in poor academic performance . the problem seem so massive , what can be done to help change food laws in one of americas largest institutions ? the way our industrial farms raise our food is nothing less than a crime . if you refuse to buy eggs from these and only buy from local farmers or those who are cage free , there will be more humanely grown food and more nutritious and safer food . eggs contain 6-7 grams of high quality protein each , one of the best food sources on the planet . if chickens were allowed to eat their natural diet , eggs would be high in omega 3 fats . cholesterol is needed by every cell in your body , especially the brain . the brain makes it own cholesterol , but statins stop this production , and cholesterol is such a large moleule that it can not cross the blood brain barier . what happens ? memory loss , dementia , etc . elderly with the highest cholesterols live the longest … .check out anthony colpo ’ s book , the great cholesterol con , and read the research findings on cholesterol and heart disease . why is it france enjoys such a low incidence of heart disease and has one of the highest intakes of cholesterol and saturated fat ? find out about ancel key ’ s , the great lier ! how our government adopted standards based on assumption and then tried to prove their hypothesis . 50 years of lies and billions of $ for the pharmaceutical industry . and worst of all focusing on a lie and ignoring what really does make a difference . a high carbohydrate diet is a killer ! ! stop eating sugar , and that low fat / high carbohydrate diet .. it ’ s not working ! ! stop smoking , exercise daily , decreasing stress , correct your omega 3 / 6 ratio ! , eat more omega-3 fats ( saturated fat intake helps improve omega3 status and immune function , pufas suppress your immune system ) . get adequate magnesium , coenzymeq10 , selenium , l-carnitine and nitric oxide , vitamin and minerals in the right amounts , garlic and a diet full of vegetables and fruits to provide the powerful phytonutrients our bodies need to stay healthy . the lie is being revealed , find out more : http : / / www.cnn.com / 2015 / 02 / 19 / health / dietary-guidelines / anthony colpo ? lol ! on his blog and videos plantpositive has slain colpo ’ s bogus research and “ theories ” and totally laid to rest any doubts about why keys opted to eliminate certain radically changed populations from his studies ! don ’ t believe what you want to read or hear , do the science ! please , especially here ! other than that , a lot of what you say has validity , but some of it is just misinformation that the paleo crowd loves to re-chant , ad nauseum ! plants heal , animals are foreign proteins and harm us in many ways . any benefits they confer can more easily be gotten from not killing a living being . a balance will help , but why not just go all plants ? it is totally doable , stop kidding yourselves and spreading silly disinfo ! the 77 pages of scientific references in the great cholesterol con are quite credible . colpo is not alone in his findings . i appreciate the reference to the plantpositive website . i will check it out . thanks ! i have yet to read anything good about ancel keys so it should be interesting . eating animal flesh is not my thing either . i do free range eggs every once in a while … … .. and then non-gmo organic plants . but the idea that cholesterol causes heart disease is like blaming the paramedic for the accident . my point isn ’ t to eat paleo , my point is we need to be looking elsewhere and quit wasting our money and lives on a lie . stress , sugar & obesity , pufa , smoking , inactivity , environmental toxins , etc these are the killers.your body would probably love to turn all the cholesterol it makes into vitamin d3 . too little time too little sunshine . the meatless diet can add more than 10 years to your life.i am in total agreement with you on the “ killers ” and i personally think the cholesterol issue is a smokescreen for eating animal products in general . good , bad or indifferent , it only comes from animals , besides what we ourselves produce , the issue isn ’ t just cholesterol . glad to hear you are primarily plant based too ! the garbage they call our “ food ” supply is getting more frightening , it isn ’ t even food anymore , and it ’ s devastating when you see so many sick kids . we never heard of asthma , allergies , autism , and the list goes on , when i was a kid in school in the 60 ’ s , but now the school nurses can ’ t keep up with doing out all the medications in my grandkids school ! it really scares the bleep out of me ! i think this person represents what most americans eat and do . i like this site because it gives me hope that i am not going to get many chronic diseases and have lots of options in health . you will not find many friends here for your ideas that a plant based high carb diet is bad . this is not a pro paleo or adkins site . dr. greger is hoping to instill healthier living in all americans . i would say that rich people live longer and western americans have less disease than the third world . i would also say our diet is a factor . i would say for the first time our children are not going to live as long as us , and this is when smoking is declining . why are the wealthier healthier than the poor when the poor eat so much less meat ? well , if you lived in the depression according to one poster , your increased consumption of beans would mean you would live five years longer than any other time . statistically , i would rather be rich than poor for my health . however , the rich are not the blessed of modern religion . why are the poor not healthier if they are more blessed ? why do those who go to harvard live longer than any other cohort group in the country ? this disjunct keeps priests awake . if you work in the egg industry , eggs are probably a big factor in what nourishes america . i would say the fda might say that it is okay to call an egg nourishing . i would also say that they are not something that is going to keep you alive into your 100s . is this your goal ? eggs have fed americans . are they part of a complete diet ? maybe not according to the food groups the vegans of this site are drawing . it is possible that cholesterol is made by the liver to fed something in the body that is not well fed by cholesterol as vegans , who do not eat cholesterol , still have cholesterol in their bodies . in this way , cholesterol is not an essential element , but it is a nutrient on food labels . vegans do not have any cholesterol at all in their diet . .so what they do is focus on protein in eggs . but a recent study that i don ’ t think the egg industry had any part in hinted that eggs might help prevent type 2 diabetes .

PLAIN-3200	anabolic steroids in meat some hormones we do implant in farm animals , though . last year japanese researchers were lamenting the dramatic increase in hormone-dependent cancers in their country — four times more breast and ovarian cancer , 8 times more endometrial cancer and 10 times more prostate cancer just in the last 25 years . they suspect it might be because they import so much hormone-laden beef from the united states , but just because we implant cattle with hormones doesn ’ t mean it actually makes it into the meat . we inject these hormone implants in the ears of cattle , but the ears get chopped off at slaughter so the u.s. beef industry argues that the hormones don ’ t get into the meat , but these researchers were suspicious , so they compared the hormone levels in american beef to japanese beef , where they don ’ t commonly inject cattle with hormones . they found up to 600 times the level of estrogens in american beef . so they got the feeling that the increasing consumption of estrogen-rich american beef following steroid implantation might facilitate estrogen accumulation in the human body and could be related to the incidence of hormone-dependent cancers , although further studies are required . . for example , eggs may be the greatest source of estrogens in a person ’ s “ normal ” diet . why would estrogen-rich beef lead to prostate cancer — you think of that more related to male hormones like testosterone . we inject cattle with that too . just like athletes can use doping agents in sports to build up their muscles , in the livestock industry anabolic steroids are given to cattle to “ beef ” up their muscles . we don ’ t just give estrogens , we implant anabolic male steroids with brand names like magnum and , “ steer-oid , ” some of which contain androgens like testosterone . where are these hormones found the most ? researchers in iran last year compared the levels of testosterone in the meat , liver , and testicles of sheep . what , did they find ? interestingly , though testicles produce testosterone they don ’ t store it , and so builds up elsewhere in the body . in fact , the levels of anabolic steroids in meat can be so high that studies have shown that athletes who eat certain kinds of meat may be falsely accused of abusing steroids . as with dairy , eating meat may also affect prepubescent children , boosting their production of male sex hormones in both boys and girls , which may hasten the first appearance of pubic hair between ages 6-8 . even though the effect was small , the fact that it ’ s a modifiable factor — something you can change about your child ’ s diet — makes it potentially relevant . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on hormones . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! thank you very much for your excellent website . do you have information on bioidentical hormones and their effects on women who are post menopausal ?

PLAIN-3220	reversing cognitive decline if you or anyone you know is currently starting to suffer from cognitive decline — starting to forget things , starting to repeat things — there is some exciting new research published this year . this year , they took folks with mild cognitive impairment and had them exercise 30 minutes a day for 6 months , versus a control group that just , stretched for half an hour every day instead of exercised . here ’ s the data … they did this test of cognitive performance at the beginning and then repeated it at the end of the 6 months . as you can see in that six month period those not exercising — just stretching — continued to decline . at the end of six months , both men and women got fewer correct answers then they did when they started . now what they were hoping for is that by adding exercise they could slow down this decline . so if instead of just stretching every day , if they were doing aerobic exercise , getting some blood to their brain , maybe they ’ d only decline half as much , or ideally , not decline at all — stay the same , have zero fewer correct answers . but this is what they found instead . the cognitive decline reversed — they actually did better at the end of six months than when they started . drugs can ’ t do that ; exercise can . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on cognition . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! hi dr. greger , do you know of any research that compares rates of cognitive decline among people treated for hypertension vs people not treated ? my concern is that when a person takes medication to lower their bp , their diastolic may go too low and decrease the blood flow returning to their heart and brain . could this decrease in perfusion contribute to or even cause white matter disease and cognitive decline ? i ’ ve seen the research that shows lowering bp decreases the number of strokes , but what if it increased rates of cognitive decline ? my mother was a lifelong vegetarian who walked 4 miles a day and was treated for hypertension from age 46 until she died . she was diagnosed with white matter disease and mild cognitive impairment at age 67 which slowly progressed until she died at age 81 . my sister and i are both whole , plant-based vegans . my average bp is 130-140 over 80-90 . my sister ’ s is higher . when we are stressed ( even happy stress ) our bp can go over 160 / 100 . we are both thin ( bmi ’ s of 18.5 and 19.5 ) . so far , both of us have refused to take blood pressure medication . we wonder if it did more harm than good for our mother . she had many episodes where her bp went too low which caused fainting and falling ( breaking her pelvis once ) . her bp medication and dosages were adjusted several times during the 35 years that she was treated for hypertension . she never had a stroke , but she needed fulltime care the last 4 years of her life due to decreased mobility and decreased cognitive ability . we wonder if decades of blood pressure medication causes side effects to the brain that pharmaceutically-funded studies are failing to look at . your input on this question will be appreciated ! vegans with high bp ! me to ! i am 61 with a bmi 22 . i do not exercise enough but after seeing this video i will try to do more . great question ! . bp medication interferes with potassium absorption . lack of potassium causes cell degradation that is why i refuse to take bp medication.good job dr.keep getting the word out because dying of dementia related things is no fun for anyone ; patients and / or care givers.for some context , please check out my associated blog post alzheimer ’ s disease : up to half of cases potentially preventable ! bravo ! is there any way to reverse osteoporosis ?

PLAIN-3230	wart cancer viruses in food last year , i talked about butcher ’ s warts , a condition that afflicts those who handle fresh meat for a living because of the viruses in meat , but it ’ s more than just a cosmetic issue . earlier this year , a landmark study of cancer mortality in poultry workers was released . we ’ ve known that people who handle a lot of fresh chicken get a lot of warts on their hands , but the concern is that some of the wart viruses are oncogenic , or cancer-causing . workers in poultry slaughtering and processing are exposed to these cancer-causing viruses , some of which are the most potent cancer-causing agents known in animals , but what does that mean for people ? well , compared to the general population , poultry workers appear to have an excess of cancers of the mouth , nasal cavities , throat . cancer of the tongue , the tonsils , the inner ear , then down the esophagus , rectal / anal cancer , and liver , bone marrow , and blood cancers as well . the reason it ’ s so important to study this group is because it ’ s possible that the cancer-causing viruses present in poultry and poultry products could be transmitted to anyone handing raw poultry . proper cooking will kill any and all chicken wart and cancer viruses , but the problem is that meat may come into our homes fresh or frozen and contaminate our hands or kitchen surfaces before it gets into the pot . same concern with other meat . there was a fascinating case report about pork intake and human papillomavirus , hpv , which can cause cancerous anal and genital warts . oh , the poor guy . 19 years old . giant warty tumor nearly an inch in diameter protruding from the tip of his penis . they cut it off , but it grew right back and so they asked for a dietary history . he was eating more than a pound of pork a day . they told him to stop the pork , and the tumor completely regressed on its own — totally disappeared . the doctors were so blown away , they even went as far as to suggest that the low cervical cancer rates in israel could be because they eat so little pork . so why do i have warts on my fingers ? i have been vegan for four and a half years . how can i get rid of them ? the animal you most likely got your wart virus infection from was homo sapiens . wart viruses are thought to be typically transmitted when using a towel or something someone else with a wart has used . salicylic acid is probably the most effective treatment ( 75 % success rate compared to about 50 % for placebo ) . thanks for your question , heidi ! hi dr i love your videos , keep up the good work . i have been trying to find information about the prevention of sore throats on your website . i am a vegetarian and do no have milk but i seem to constantly getting a sore throat can you help ? hi andrew , there are a number of reasons why someone might get a sore throat . if you ’ re getting them often , you might want to look at possible lifestyle factors . things like pollution , not washing your hands , or even dehydration could contribute to the frequency and severity of the symptoms you ’ re feeling . preventative dietary strategy ? drink lots of fluids ( hot or room temperature ) when you ’ re feeling a sore throat come on . you might want to try a warm bowl of miso soup to get the pro-biotic benefits ( just don ’ t over-heat and kill the health promoting enzymes ) . avoid alcohol . and make sure you ’ re getting vitamins and minerals such as zinc , vitamin e and vitamin c. oh , and make sure you ’ re getting enough sleep : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / sleep-immunity / also , please check out my associated blog post : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / blog / 2012 / 05 / 17 / poultry-and-penis-cancer / ! please also check out my associated blog post , poultry and penis cancer ! butcher 's warts , cancer , carcinogens , chicken , colon health , ear health , esophageal cancer , esophagus health , inner ear cancer , mortality , mouth cancer , nasal cavity cancer , oral health , pork , poultry , poultry workers , skin health , throat cancer , throat health , tongue cancer , tonsil cancer , viral infections , wart viruses , warts the wart-causing viruses in animals may present more than just a cosmetic issue for consumers . other videos on cancer viruses and meat include : chicken dioxins , viruses , or antibiotics ? carcinogenic retrovirus found in eggs poultry exposure tied to liver and pancreatic cancer poultry exposure and neurological diseaseplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on poultry . also , there are 1,686 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well ! for more context , check out my associated blog post , poultry and penis cancer .

i started looking into homeopathy lately . i ’ m shocked that so many people subscribe to it ! total snake oil.sounds nearly as dubious as “ faith healing ” to me , except that the special diluted / holy water goes in your mouth instead of sprinkled on your forehead.very dissappointed in dr. greger . there is nothing in this video that is objective . you just say its witch craft just great . you are sir ignorant and a bigot ! please see this systematic review of systematic reviews of homeopathy , concluding that “ no homeopathic remedy that was demonstrated to yield clinical effects that are convincingly different from placebo , ” available full-text at http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc1874503 / pdf / bcp0054-0577.pdfit ’ s important to note at this point that placebo results are very powerful and sometimes more powerful than ; for example the use of ssri drugs . all drugs ; like anything else , are vibrations or frequencies or resonance . obviously the placebos rely on the brain or organs to release endogenous neurotransmitters or hormones rather than injecting exogenous versions.totally agree with you – maharawj : - ) well thought out.anyone who can believe in the “ theory ” of vibrational energy , and that increasing the dilution of a substance simultaneously increases its potency really isn ’ t paying attention . faith in things that make no logical sense might be nice in some parts of your life , but medicine should be based on science.when taken homeopathic remedies internally , there may be little benefits to adults . but how can you call in a placebo ? babies do not fall into the trickery of the placebo affect , yet have experienced negative overdosing of homeopathic remedies . this proves that although they make not be strong enough to be taken internally by adults , they are still not placebo . for adults , stick to the topical ointments only.uurgh … .. excuse the numerous grammatical typos . cell phone . : - ) i experienced homeopathy in a negative way . i was given several different remedies and become quite ill for months . i have used some that seem to work . i feel it depends on the constitution of the person and the type of remedy given . ” witchcraft ’ in my world has a positive meaning , the ‘ herbalists ’ were known as witches , and most everyone would agree , that herbs are a potent form of healing the body.this study proves otherwise http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed ?

as far as i can see , the systemic review only concludes that homeopathy is not an evidence based treatment.i ’ ve had a seleveral miles long facebook discussion about the subject and we managed to find some trials that concluded that the homeopathic remedy was equally effective as the established remedy . all were lacking placebo though , but i don ’ t think it rules homeopathy out . it just shows that you will get results no matter wich remedy you use . i think more research needs to be done.as a response to homeopathy does not make logical sense , i agree . but that does not mean it is wrong , it just means that with our current understanding of the world , it sounds upside down . but wasn ’ t it the same thing that happened when someone discovered bacteria ? everybody could see that this glass of water has no ingredients , so it is wrong to say that it is full of bacteria that can make you sick . no , they just didn ’ t have the tools then , to see bacteria . maybe we are in the same situation today : we can measure with our tools , that there are no ingredients left in homeopathic medicine , so it must be wrong . maybe we just don ’ t have the rigth tools yet ? homeopathy is energetic medicine that can be explained by quantum physics as far as i understand . the sugar , alcohol or water that is diluted , carries energetic information from the matter it has been in contact with from the beginning.in the following experiment they could measure the degree of each potency from purchased remedies and see that the higher the dilution , the higher the energetic load . the experiment is not conclusive and obviously need to be replicated by non homeopaths . again , i think more research needs to be done.http : / / hpathy.com / scientific-research / homeopathic-potencies-identified-by-a-new-magnetic-resonance-method-homeopathy-an-energetic-medicine / the difficulty with homeopathy when trying to compare it to allopathic medicine is that homeopathy medicine is for the particular person – not for / against a cerrtain disease . this means that one cannot declare a certain remedy curing e.g. adhd . the practitioner heals the person and may therefore give all her adhd patients different remedies . also , classical homeopathy practitioners would never mix remedies or change them in a fast sequence – they don ’ t do this to keep track of whether actually their choice renders success . this big misconception of homeopathy – that remedy a heals e.g. headaches – leads to random results . so homeopathy renders potent results – but only when administered by a talented practitioner … and that ’ s its biggest weakness.lots of great information on this site and i really appreciate all the science to back up the information.i ’ ll admit though that when i came to look at the information on homeopathy , i was a little apprehensive . the reason being that if homeopathy got the thumbs up , i would have felt that the rest of the information on the site was a little dubious . excellent , homeopathy gets the thumbs down.it seems that many sites that promote a plant based diet also promote pseudoscience , which i think can be really of putting to the more scientifically minded amung us. alternative medicine , asthma , attention deficit , brain health , cancer , cognition , complementary medicine , dementia , homeopathy , hyperactivity , lung health , meta-analysis , nutrition myths , placebo effect , pregnancy , snake oil a review of the best science on the usefulness of homeopathy to treat a variety of conditions . here ’ s more on potential placebos in medicine : do antidepressant drugs really work ?

PLAIN-3250	improving memory through diet for example , eleven years ago , blueberries gained notoriety for their ability to improve memory … among , elderly rats . now it ’ s always difficult to extrapolate between species , but i told people it might translate over and not just work in rats but work for their pet hamsters too . but we finally , this year , have human data . the first human trial to assess the potential benefit of blueberry supplementation on neurocognitive function . what do you think they found ? blueberries improve memory in humans . is this fact ? or is this fiction let ’ s look at the study . blueberries improve memory in humans ! fact . and it turns out the healthful properties may survive processing into products like blueberry jam , but best to store it in the fridge — even before it ’ s opened . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on brain health . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! dear dr. greger : i ’ ve been eating fresh / dried or frozen blueberries daily , often at least 2x a day , since learning they improve memory in older adults , thanks to your lcn vol . 5 . i ’ ve eaten blueberries regularly for most of a decade , since learning of the usda / tufts univ. study of 40 fruits & veggies . what are optimal quantities ? since sleep is primarily for the brain to process events / thoughts of the day , would eating them again 2-3 hours before bed be wise , since they would be digested coincident with sleep ? i ’ ve been taking fish oil 2-9 grams ( now 2 x 2 times a day ) and 1 tbsp . flaxseed oil for a decade ( now 2 tbsp . flaxseeds themselves at breakfast ) . would these combine with blueberries to further optimize brain health ?

thanks muchlyhello ! i am a vegan medical student about to take the step-1 medical licensing exam was wondering if you had any tips for brain-boosting snacks to help power-through 8-hours of intense-testing . if there ’ s anything to do / avoid the night before / at breakfast , i ’ d appreciate knowing that as well ! thank you for your time and consideration.some people ’ s memory gets better with age no matter what they eat . “ that fish he caught keeps getting bigger and bigger , every time he tells that story . ” dr. greger , are there any studies showing that eating well has an immediate effect on cognitive performance ? take , for example , people who work in an office setting all day . some of them eat a mcdonald ’ s breakfast sandwich on the way in , candy out of the secretary ’ s dish mid-morning , two pieces of pepperoni pizza for lunch , and tons of coffee with cream and sugar all day long . other folks eat oatmeal with flax seeds and blueberries in the morning , and a big bowl of broccoli , tofu , and brown rice for lunch . by the 4 p.m. strategy meeting won ’ t the people in the second camp be thinking more clearly ? are there studies on this kind of immediate effect of diet quality on cognitive performance ? thanks.dr greger , i have been having very little success at getting a healthy whole foods plat diet for my mother in her assisted living facility . do you have hay suggestions , or resources that might help ? thank you.dr. greger , thanks for having this forum ! would you address which amino acids are particularly important for memory ? i can only seem to go about a month on a vegan diet before developing problems , which wasn ’ t true until recently . spirulina , raw veggies , and balancing seeds and grains with every meal extends the time to about a month . but something seems to be missing ! hi carol . thanks for your questions . all essential amino acids are important . trying to recall my biochemistry , phenylalanine and tryptophan come to mind , play important role in neurotransmitter synthesis . think of dopamine ( regulates mood ) and norepinephrine ( keeps mind active , alert ) , serotonin ( helps with sleep ) , etc . i try to stay away from counseling folks to focus on particular amino acids . it it perfectly fine to know what foods are higher than others , but all protein sources have some . if you are eating a mix of foods with protein , all amino acids good for memory should be covered . the idea is variety and finding the best protein sources available . beans , lentils , peanuts , other nuts and seeds are very high in phenyalanine and tryptophan . i would cautious about spirulina as a protein source and healthy food . i hope this helps a bit ! sincerely , joseph animal studies , anthocyanins , berries , blueberries , brain health , cognition , jam , memory , processed foods blueberries have been shown to improve cognition in rats , but what about in people ?

it was a case report . here is a link . why take juice when real fruit and vegetables are available ? here is the link to the article — plushttp : / / www.amjmed.com / article / s0002-9343 ( 09 ) 00712-8 / fulltexthere is the link to the case report. http : / / www.amjmed.com / article / s0002-9343 ( 09 ) 00712-8 / abstractjuice plus , or touchstone essentials are not juices . the answer to your question is cost . people use these products because they can ’ t afford to buy vegetables and fruits at the exhorbitant prices . do a cost analysis and the answer is quite obvious.i haven ’ t looked at the nutritional information yet , but unfortunately you could be right about the cost issue . not that i promote this type of supplement at all , i believe in whole foods that you recognise when you buy or grow them . although , it is difficult to say that cost is of no significance to those desperate to become healthy.interesting you should choose to highlight a case report of hepatotoxicity of a cancer patient while avoiding comment on the 24 published studies , many randomized and placebo controlled , which show benefits . i love your site , but you appear to be suffering a bias here . in particular i ’ d like to see you review the reduction in oxidative stress in athletes ( three studies ) and the apparent induction of superoxide dismutase ( one study ) found by the researchers in the carolinas and austria . as well , the inhibition of brachial artery constriction after a high fat meal and the arrested coronary artery calcification in hypertensives is intriguing and warrants comment.if an unnecessary product has both potential benefits and risks ( such as juiceplus , or kombucha , or spirulina , or green tea supplements ) i tend to err on the side of caution and encourage folks to stick to things that only boast benefits .. why accept any unnecessary risk as all ? you ’ re comparing a product to others and using faulty logic to draw conclusions . you honestly believe that everyone is going to buy the “ guilt by association ” argument ? i am not . green tea supplements are useless and possibly risky according to recent studies . so what ? green tea is beneficial and anyone can afford it . you are not telling us what is risky about any ingredient in juice plus . please do that in future videos or articles.furthermore , how can you say it is an “ unnecessary product ” while a recent huge study in europe was just released proving that people need seven or more servings of vegetables and fruits to avoid the big diseases that are epidemics all around us . please , dr greger . i believe as you do that food is medicine . what ingredient in juice plus or touchstone essentials ( a “ similar ” product but with more transparent advertising , i believe ) is risky ? the answer to your last question is obvious . personal budgets.i agree with your budget argument . the study you mentioned regarding 7 or more servings was quite popular , i ’ m from the uk , but only a few days ago in july 2014 , a reversal on the same study was published . it suggested that increasing to 7 or more from 5 made little measurable positive difference.articles were posted on the bbc and guardian websites , i haven ’ t checked anywhere else . it seems that recommendations change frequently : ) boast benefits ? you mean like the prescription drugs you prescribe ? you wanna trust the ama ? ? ? have you investigated univera products ? for such reasons we forget to look outside the good ole usa. for objective non biased information and knowledge . it would be interesting to compare australian , european , etc with us research . personally i still will consume aloe juice , noni , kava , and juice vegetables in addition to eating plant based and grass fed foods . it is the over-consumption of klooaid that i am most concerned about here.juice + video is only 20 seconds , i suspect video is not working properly.any info on univera products ? they claim to be science based , better than all others.what if you dont have access to a variety of fruits and vegetables , would juice plus then be a good option when traveling to places with limited produce options ? absolutely ! it is only concentrated fruits and vegetables . it bridges the gap as most people can ’ t east the variety of 9-13 servings per day . i have been taking for 5 years and love it . dr. katz at yale is a big advocate as well as dr. william sears . read the research and decide for yourself . there are 2 studies showing that it reduces systemic inflammation so not sure what happened with this one case of liver inflammation.juicing is not something dr. greger advocates. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / fruit-juice-fail / hey lisa , it ’ s quite misleading to say that jp + is only concentrated fruits and vegetables . go back to your jp + orchard and garden blend labels and read them . vitamin c , beta carotene , d-tocopherol , folic acid , enzymes , and acidophilus are all added back in after manufacturing . jp + says that it is because the fda requires that every label says the same thing , and they can ’ t guarantee that every bottle will contain exactly the same amount of nutrients ( as you would not to be able to compare apple to apple , or cucumber to cucumber ) . therefore , to standardize , they add nutrients they can id by amount . go to the vineyard blend label and see : l-arginine , l-carnitine , d-alpha tocopherol , calcium ascorbate , magnesium stearate , “ natural enzyme blend , ” coenzyme q10 , and folic acid . this may be just fine and all super healthy , but it is not “ only concentrated fruits and vegetables . ” also , though i have not read the studies myself , every independent review of the jp + reports i ’ ve seen indicate that virtually all of them are inconclusive . i have been taking jp + for over 5 years and honestly believe that it has helped keep me healthy . however , i am under no illusions that their marketing provides full disclosure.what happened with that one case , may very well be overuse of ibuprofen the woman was taking for cancer pain , which was probably withheld right after admission , and the liver enzymes were reduced . i don ’ t buy that one case study as evidence of anything , except the foolishness of people that draw conclusions from it . as scientists , we learned not to be.but the ingredients in jp absolutely couldn ’ t have caused it ? aren ’ t you being as presumptuous as the point you are criticizing ? i am finding the most common way of defending jp is by being confrontational and rude and by inferring those that oppose are stupid.as dr. greger has shared , juice plus is not a health promoting supplement. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / juice-plus % c2 % ae-supplements / when traveling , dried fruits might be a better option.are the powdered supergreen foods beneficial ?

PLAIN-3270	flaxseeds vs. chia seeds flax seeds have also been shown to slow prostate cancer , but which is healthier ? chi-chi-chi-chia or flax ? well , there are 3 reasons why people eat flax : the cardioprotective omega-3 ’ s , the cholesterol-lowering soluble fiber , and cancer-fighting lignans . compared to chia seeds … flax has more omega 3 ’ s . but , to my surprise , chia has significantly more fiber , which makes chia obama , very happy . looks like lignans are going to be the decider . flax has always been considered so amazing because it has about 100 times more cancer-fighting lignans than any plant in the world , until , evidently , chia seeds were tested . according to the website of “ better than flax ” anutra-brand chia seeds , chia has 25 times more lignans than flax . that ’ s incredible ! no really , that ’ s in-credible . i called them up , challenged them on it , and it turns out they lied . flax is healthier . nothing beats flax , just two table spoons a day will keep most diseases away : ) i don ’ t know about most diseases , but a 2011 review did conclude that “ studies proved that flaxseed has tremendous potential in disease prevention particularly cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) , osteoporosis , rheumatoid arthritis , cancer ( breast , colon , and prostate cancer ) , and constipation and also affects immunity favorably . ” so listen to nouh – two tablespoons a day ! hi dr. greger , i ’ m a pregnant vegan and i ’ m concerned about not getting enough omega 3 . the ob / gyn told me to stop taking algal oil because it ’ s not fda regulated . so i ’ ve been having 1 tablespoon of chia seeds a day . the dietician told me yesterday to have chia seeds and flaxseeds everyday . i ’ m so confused ! are you saying she ’ s wrong about flaxseeds ? and is a tablespoon of chia seeds enough omega while i ’ m pregnant ? ronni , this was the dr . ’ s reply to someone up in the thread italics mine . “ michael greger m.d. nf team chewy • 10 months agonot only safe , but extremely healthy ! i would encourage you to eat them with your vegetables to enhance carotenoid consumption ( and encourage you to eat other nuts and seeds ) . the only population that i would advise against flaxseed consumption is pregnant women . ” thanks for getting back to me via email . sorry to read about morning sickness … medicine still hasn ’ t figured that one out . first congratulations on the vegan nutritional approach to pregnancy … you have already taken a huge step in avoiding exposure of your baby to persistent organic pollutants such as dioxin and endocrine disrupters and metals such as mercury and arsenic . dr. greger cites a study which says preliminary data suggests avoiding flax seed in last two trimesters of pregnancy to decrease preterm delivery … . see video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / breast-cancer-survival-and-lignan-intake / . unfortunately the cited reference isn ’ t listed in under sources cited . it is very important to take vitamin b12 , insure adequate iodine and folate . there is a book , the everything vegan pregnancy book … i haven ’ t read but it might be worth a look . i would review the other video ’ s that dr. greger has on pregnancy and work with your ob / gyn to work out a program for you . as i mentioned my daughter had two very successful pregnancies but had to “ show ” her physicians that her protein intake was adequate as they were pushing meat / dairy … maybe they learned from her . seems like avoiding flax for the last 2 / 3 of pregnancy is reasonable . good luck with the pregnancy and congratulations.i learned about chia seeds only a few months ago . i had been buying and throwing away flax seeds for over a year . i just can ’ t make myself eat flax . i don ’ t like smoothies . i don ’ t like texture of flax seeds on things that i put them on . i just have them in my fridge until it is time to throw out . ( until recently when i started giving 2-3 tablespoons a day to my great dane who loves it . ) so , i jumped on the idea of the chia seeds , but was really wondering if they were as healthy as the websites claim . this video answered two thirds of that question and i ’ m grateful.my thought would be : ok , so chia has only 80 % of the omega 3s as flax – but if i will eat chia and not flax , then the one that is healthier is the one that i ’ m willing to eat. yes ? it ’ s still something of a question for me because of the lignan issue . you say that flax has more lignans , but how much more ? do we know how many lignans are in chia seeds ? here ’ s another question : to get the nutrition from flax , you have to grind it up . i ’ ve been soaking the chia seeds over night . the seeds swell up and for the most part , get the consistency of tapioca ( which i love ) . however , there is still a tiny , tiny hard spot in the center . so , am i absorbing all the nutrition i should be absorbing from chia seeds which are soaked overnight , but not ground up ? or is all the good parts of the chia seeds in that teeny tiny hard spot and my body won ’ t absorb it ? thanks ! get the ezekial cereal with flax in it. you dont even notice ityou might consider flax oil . it doesn ’ t have the texture . i added it to my daughters soy milk when she was a toddler because she was not putting on weight to the dr ’ s liking . she didn ’ t complain of any taste . ; ) oh and i put my milled flax seeds in ground beef and don ’ t even notice its there . my family doesn ’ t either . so i sneak the extra fiber and nutrients into them . my friend ’ s very very picky eater son ( textures and in general ) that comes to my house often didn ’ t even notice.for anyone who is interested , here is the breakfast that i have been eating every morning for 2 months.put the following in a bowl the night before and stir : * 2 tablespoons chia seeds ( organic ) * 1 / 3 cup thick rolled oats ( organic ) * 2 / 3 cup water * a good dash of vanilla extract ( maybe a teespoon ) * a large amount of date sugar ( maybe 1 / 3 cup ? ) * a large amount of cocoa powder ( maybe 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 cup ? ) * 2-3 teespoons of a nut butter . i ’ ve been experimenting with different flavors . * sometimes i also add one or more of the following : cinemamon , cloves , pumpkin pie spices , banana slicesby the morning , it is the consistence of a nice thick oatmeal , but it has a taste and texture that beats plain oatmeal by a million miles ! and it ’ s pretty healthy , right ? ? ? if i get 2 tablespoons of chia seeds every day , do i still need an epa / dha supplement ? ? see toxics post to me , above . there ’ s a couple good books on chia seeds on the raw food world store site . lynnflax seed question : roasted flax seeds ? i recently purchased a bag of flax seeds ( admittedly : mostly for my dog , but some for me too ) from trader joes . i guess i didn ’ t look very closely at the bag . it actually says , “ roasted flax seed ” . the flax has a strong nutty smell – very strong compared to regular flax which i can ’ t smell at all.the back of the bag says , “ roasting the flax seeds reduces the natural moisture level in the seeds , resulting in 8-10 % more fiber , omega-3s and protein than regular flax . ” does this claim make sense to anyone ? also , even if the claim is true technically , i wonder if humans would actually benefit from this additional fiber and omega-3s ? wouldn ’ t some of that good stuff be destroyed in terms of bio-availability somehow through the cooking ? i ’ m thinking about often hearing the advice that it is healthier to buy raw nuts and roast them ourselves . i ’ m not sure why , but i think it is because the roasting causes the good stuff in the nut to degrade faster ? ? ? wouldn ’ t the same process apply to flax seed ? or maybe the issue with the roasting of flax seeds would only apply depending on the temperature of the roasting ? i thought i remembered that dr. greger wrote somewhere that it is not temperature that affects the omega-3s in flax , but exposure to oxygen – at least up to a certain temperature.note that the bag does say , “ refrigerate after opening ” . if i did refrigerate , along with putting the seeds in an air-tight container , would the flax seeds stay fresh for a good long time even if they are roasted ? another related question : one of the reasons i give the ground up flax seed to my dog is that a vet said that flax seed has anti-inflammatory properties . i assume the same is true for humans . the question is , would roasting destroy the anti-inflammatory properties of flax seeds ? any thoughts ? see if i can answer some of your questions . ground flax seed has many nutritional benefits . dry roasting seems to enhance the nutrient absorption of nuts see video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / raw-food-diet-myths / and since seeds are similar to nuts it might also apply . i ’ m not aware of any science to support . roasting may drive out some water but seems to me since we want to avoid processed food it is more advisable to go with unroasted flax seeds . of course you want to make sure you either grind the seeds or buy it already ground up . the seeds are very tough and the flax seeds will come out without contributing to your health . flax is very healthy . i find that buying the ground flax meal and then refrigerating / freezing is the best way to keep it from spoiling . it does have antiinflammatory properties being high in omega 3 ’ s . whether heat would destroy the antiinflammatory properties would depend on the temperature . i would stick with unroasted in the future until a study comes out supporting roasting flax seeds … keep tuned to nutritionfacts.org … hi jj , i ’ m not well-informed on flax seed , but in many cases cooking foods , especially grains , can actually increase some nutrients ’ bioavailabiltiy by breaking down materials that can interfere with the body ’ s ability to properly absorb important nutrients . as far as i ’ ve seen , roasted flax seeds are very beneficial . i imagine that you will indeed be getting the nutrients mentioned on the package , and may even be better off with roasted rather than raw . until we know more information , maybe you can switch betwen raw and roasted . i ’ ll keep an eye out on this topic for a more informed answer . i hope this helps ! alexandrawell , now i think i may be overdoing the omega 3 thing . i use a big t dry of chia seed in my morning smoothie and i still use a lot of fish oil . i have the same question as jj . also the lignan issue . how am i doing with the chia ? and to share how i do it , i used to soak them up ahead of time , but became lazy , so i just put a glass of water in the bottom of the blender with a tablespoon of chia and run it on the lowest speed to stir . let it sit while i get the vegis and fruit ready . stir again and in goes everything else with some more water . it really only takes abt 5 minutes to start to gel . just make sure it has enough water.hello lynn , i must address your use of fish oil , as i highly recommend stopping its use entirely ! fish oil does not reduce inflammation which is one of the main reasons people take it http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19623203 fish oil , similairly to fish , is the number one source of contaminants in the food supply and the distilling process to clean fish oil of heavy metals does not work. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-distilled-fish-oil-toxin-free / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / food-sources-of-pcb-chemical-pollutants / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / ddt-in-fish-oil-supplements / if you must supplement for omega 3 , then take algae oil http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2 / i have said this before in a previous comment , but i am not an advocate of consuming any oil since oil is essentially liquid fat with no nutrition . according to dr. mcdougall , “ a condition of ‘ essential fatty acid deficiency ’ is essentially unknown in free-living populations … .true essential fatty acid deficiency would result in : loss of hair , scaly dermatitis , capillary fragility , poor wound healing , increased susceptibility to infection , fatty liver , and growth retardation in infants and children . ” here is the full article http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / misc / 2007nl / aug / oils.htm although the algae oil may have the dha , oil is still oil and not a whole plant food . i respect dr. greger ’ s statement of avoiding fish oil for its many contaminants and using algae oil as a substitute but is it really necessary to ingest any pure dha in the form of an oil ? after weighing it out , to me , it doesn ’ t seem necessary.hi tox ! i was just surfing the new site and noticed you had talked to me a year ago . thanks ! i guess i missed it then , but am pleasantly surprised to see all the info you included . i might say i stopped the fish oil shortly after i posted that . i also read the report that it wasn ’ t doing any thing good for my heart . i also love what i have learned from drs. esselstyne and mcdougall , etc . my doctor is a mcdougall-er , so am getting the no oil talk from him too . as long as i have some weight to come off i avoid nuts , olives , avacados , and other fatty vegan goodies . of course i miss them , but must get the job done . probably won ’ t go back to them in the long run . funny how one gets used to a new way of living when willing ! huh ? is it perfectly safe to eat 2 tablespoons of pre-ground flaxseed daily for the long term ? i am a gluten-free vegan who eats no other fats / seeds / nuts / avocados … .i eat vegetables , beans , fruit , squash , brown rice / brown rice cakes / air popped organic popcorn.you need healthy fats in your diet . avoiding all fats is truly not good for you.fats are for babies . or the injured . or if winter is coming.hoping to hear whether 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed daily for the long term is perfectly safe … .not only safe , but extremely healthy ! i would encourage you to eat them with your vegetables to enhance carotenoid consumption ( and encourage you to eat other nuts and seeds ) . the only population that i would advise against flaxseed consumption is pregnant women.can you consume chia seeds when pregnant instead of flaxseeds ? why should pregnant women avoid flaxseed ? what is dangerous about eating it ? i wish that i ’ d known this 9 years ago when i was pregnant ! i ate 2 heaping tablespoons daily the entire pregnancy which was great by the way . 20 pounds on and off within a week of giving birth.the risk for having a still born baby is increased when one consumes flax seeds when pregnant.is this true ? dr. greger covered this in one of his videos . he mentions that there is an increased risk of stillbirth seen with flaxseed use when one is pregnant . i believe the video has not yet been released.a great breakfast : dump into a smallish saucepan : 1 / 3 cup quinoa , 1 / 3 cup steel cut oats , 2 t. chia seeds , 2 t. ground flaxseeds , 1 t. cinnamon , 1 t. ground cardamom , 1 t. ground nutmeg 1 sliced banana 1 dash salt 1 1 / 2 cup hot water let it all soak for at least 15 minutes to overnight . then simmer for 15-20 minutes , stirring often . a splash of vanilla extract at the end is good , also.flax versus chia ? why not both – thanks badgett ! sounds delicious . anyone else have any personal recipes to share ? i ’ ve only got a few ( see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / recipes . what are your thoughts on the new book called “ chia : the complete guide to the ultimate superfood ” by dr. wayne coates . ? after browsing in this book today , i found out that overall chia seeds are better for you then flax seeds . he states that lignans are known to start and prevent cancer . so , from what i understood and maybe you can clarify is lignans are good but how much ? i found this book very informative as i take about a tbsp of chia seeds with my oatmeal w / almond milk and cinnamon. yummie . just set it in the fridge for about 10-15mins … its sooo good.flax seeds are actually the number one source of lignins , and second to flax would be sesame seeds.hi dr. greger … here ’ s my morning smoothiefew blackberries , strawberries , blueberries , raspberries 1 pitaya or dragonfruit 1 kiwi 1 apple 350ml green tea ( cold steep ) 2 to 3 cloves of garlic ( organic ) pinch of all spice , cayenne , black paepper , turmeric 1 / 8 tsp freshly ground clovesi ’ m allergic to banana : - ( what could i replace it with ? ? i bet there is no need to replace it , just leave it out . however , i bet blueberries ( or some other fruit , like diced apples ) would work great , too ! we have left the banana out many times . my husband does food-combining so doesn ’ t usually eat fruit with grains . the banana is not needed for this to be delicious.datesno need to replace it , just leave it out . however , i bet blueberries ( or some other fruit , like diced apples ) would work great , too ! thanks for sharing this amazing breakfast ! we fell instantly in love with this the first time i made it . i have a food blog and will be posting this on there very soon ! a batch is simmering on the stove right now.regarding your interview with dr fuhrman : are you more in agreement with dr fuhrman ’ s eat to live and his inclusion of nuts / seeds and not in agreement with dr esselstyn and dr mcdougall ? i definitely got that impression in regards to eating nuts / seeds . 2 tablespoons of ground flaxseed is the only added fat i eat daily with my vegetables , fruit , beans and starchy vegetable / grain.is 2t a fine amount ? thank you ! no study that i am aware of shows harm from eating two tablespoons of ground flax seed a day . you need to look at recommendations of the “ experts ” based on the best science , the populations involved and what the goals of the patient are . dr. esselstyn deals with patients who have heart disease a different population than the “ normal ” population that showed value in consumption of nuts in the primary prevention of heart disease http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / halving-heart-attack-risk / . he himself eats nuts / seeds . dr. mcdougall also accepts the consumption of nuts / seeds which are whole plant foods . as he and jeff novick rd point out if you are trying to decrease your body fat consuming foods that are high in caloric density ( 2800 cal / # for nuts ) isn ’ t a good choice . dr. mcdougall emphasizes starch intake due to meeting caloric requirements in populations . he does support the consumption of a wide range of vegetables . for all these “ experts ” you need to evaluate their claims based on the best science . all the information about antioxidants is hopeful but understanding it both within populations and for the individual patient requires assumptions that are effected by many considerations . so you have to beware of sweeping generalizations that aren ’ t supported by the scientific literature . it is challenging to make sense of it all . sounds like your diet is consistent with the best current science but keep tuned to nutritionfacts.org as the science is constantly changing.ground flaxseed have ( or is it has ? ) 37 calories and 3 grams fat per tablespoon . not too much for me . nutrition is like religion . the research becomes the bible and just about every idea can be backed up by research , as folks do with bible verses . we follow our nutrition gurus as we do with our religious leaders , with faith.i think folks hang on to their beliefs about how they should eat almost as hard as they hang on to their religious beliefs . i think the difference is that there is science on which to base how and what you eat as well as which “ guru ” you should follow . we tend to navigate our complex world through our beliefs which can be based on information , stories , relationships and goals . since science is constantly changing our beliefs are constantly tested against the newest information until at times we get to the point of shifting our beliefs . for instance i once believed that “ milk does the body good ” currently i believe that it does the body harm and often contains poisonous substances . my new belief drives me to eat , shop and cook in a different way . if a “ religious ” text were to tell me to eat milk i would ignore unless given information to shift my belief . religion is not being exposed to new science and most religious texts were written at a time when scientific paradigms or beliefs were wrong . so when selecting your belief system about eating i would go with the science keeping current via sites like nutritionfacts.org. in picking guru ’ s i would be cautious especially if they have vested self interests in what they are “ selling ” . of course beyond the health aspect is the issue of what we eats effects the environment and the suffering of animals . you might be interested in the youtube video by dr. melanie joy , carnism : the psychology of eating meat , that provides an interesting view on the non health aspects of eating . be well.just a passing thought … the bible ( one religious text ) does not say to drink milk . god did say he would lead his people into a land flowing with milk and honey , but that could mean the health of humans ( breast milk ) and abundance of plants ( that bees use to make honey ) . sorry , but i just hate to see people try to say the bible is not “ scientific ” . our creator is the ultimate scientist ! should chia seeds be ground like flax seeds , or is it best to soak them first before consuming ? also , why should pregnant women avoid flaxseed ? thanks.for some context , please check out my associated blog post the best foods : test your nutrition knowledge ! how is it best to grind flaxseeds ? also , is it ok to use preground , or is it best to grind them yourself prior to consuming ? a coffee grinder may do the job . pre ground flax seeds are much easier and nutrients are still stable in pre ground flax seed unless expired.i found a brand that uses sprouted flax seeds ! is this worth the extra money ? they claim the sprouting method increases nutrients , increases absorption , and breaks down the enzyme inhibitors.i thought that preground flax goes rancid and oxidizes ? sprouting is more of a diet fad then any real boost to health . “ the magnitude of the nutritional improvement is , however , influenced by the type of cereal , seed quality , sprouting conditions , and it is not large enough to account for in feeding experiments with higher animals . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 2692609 “ sprouting of grains causes increased enzyme activity , a loss of total dry matter , an increase in total protein , a change in amino acid composition , a decrease in starch , increases in sugars , a slight increase in crude fat and crude fiber , and slightly higher amounts of certain vitamins and minerals . most of the increases in nutrients are not true increases , however . they simply reflect the loss of dry matter , mainly in the form of carbohydrates , due to respiration during sprouting . as total carbohydrates decreases , the percentage of other nutrients increases . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 7002472 yes pre ground can go rancid and oxidize but this is why you should keep it refrigerated until expiration.a fad ? i ’ ve never heard that . all my research has shown that it is significantly healthier and more optimal … ugh , nutrition is so confusing ! re flax : so it is better to buy a bag of whole seeds and grind them myself prior to usage … or is buying a bag of preground and keeping it in the fridge / freezer ok ? the studies i presented are worth looking into regarding sprouting . advocates tend to misconstrue the data . buying a bag of pre ground flax is just fine.nutrition tends to be quite straightforward when you focus on current peer-reviewed scientific studies ( i.e. , preponderance of evidence ) and reject non-sourced statements ( conjecture and hearsay ) .i cant agree with this assment of flax seed. how can a product that is a common carrier used in oil paint be healthier than chia ? flaxseeds have more omega 3 and a much higher lignan content then any known food . further benefits can be seen with this videohttp : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / just-the-flax-maam / water is a common carrier in water-based paints … so using your same analogy , one might conclude that water is not healthy . science does not operate by analogy – it operates by evidence and observation . perhaps decisions based on current scientific studies might prove more fruitful than those based on analogy and conjecture.flax seeds are always available , and cost far less than chia seeds . flax seeds are easily ground with a coffee grinder and keep well in the freezer.i would say that if you enjoy flax seeds , stick with it . my only concern is that flax seed , when not ground fresh for use is susceptible to oxidation – particularly the omega 3 fatty acids . chia is easily digested , though with about 20 % less omega 3 – i wonder if chia might ultimately have more biologically available omega 3 in the end due to it ’ s more bio-available o-3s . when i make my morning smoothie it includes 3 oz of spinach , 3 oz of assorted kale ( seasonally available here in georgia and a cup of mixed frozen berries blended with some soy milk ( deliberately not in a vitamix to retain more fiber ) then i mix in 2 tbsp of chia , which absorbs up to 30x it ’ s weight in water and gives you a major load of fiber . mix it together , let sit and mix again in fie minutes , let sit and consume fifteen or more minutes later . i call it time released water and nutrition throughout the morning and early afternoon . i ’ d be interested to see dr greger ’ s point of view on the oxidation factor in o-3 availability , as it is more or less just my own theory and i ’ d appreciate learned counsel . also , i can ’ t get past the taste of linseed oil. hahi just discovered sweet basil seeds at my local market . they are fun to eat and kind of resemble chia seeds when soaked . any nutritional or scientific data on these yummy seeds ? how do you grind flax seeds ? i use a coffee grinder.vitamix blendersorry , have scanned through the comments and cannot seem to find the answer to how to ensure to get all of the nutrients out of chia seeds . are the best to soak , grind or will the nutrients be released by our own digestive juices ? i ’ ve bought organic seeds but want to ensure that i ’ m not missing out on the nutrition & it is not just passing through if you catch my drift ? it is best to grind the chia seeds to get the benefits . if not that , then you have to chew each and every individual seed to break through the tough cell wall.flax seeds have goitrogens , chia seeds don ’ t , so chia seeds are better considering the prevalence of hypothyroidism … .thanks for being succinct .i cracked up after you said you called them … .that was classic . i really appreciate your work . thank you.damn , doc , you hardcore . calling up the company and challenging them ! you ’ re my effing hero.just eat both ! : ) hi dr. greger … here ’ s my morning smoothiefew blackberries , strawberries , blueberries , raspberries 1 pitaya or dragonfruit 1 kiwi 1 apple 350ml green tea ( cold steep ) 2 to 3 cloves of garlic ( organic ) pinch of all spice , cayenne , black paepper , turmeric 1 / 8 tsp freshly ground cloves2 tbsp flaxseed 1 / 2 tbsp sunflower seed 10 pcs almondsall freshly groundwow ! tough love ! isn ’ t a good reason for chia over flax calcium , though ? i ’ ve been eating ground flax every day in my breakfast cereal or in my smoothies for a long time but i recently decided to do chia instead because chia seeds have some 16 % to 18 % calcium and iron , but ground flax only has 4 % of each of those in 2 tablespoons . i find it hard to get enough calcium without making choices to incorporate more , like picking chia over flax . in my attempts to find high-calcium foods i saw in the bulk isle that chia has a lot of calcium and it seemed natural to jump ships.i was looking for something beside ground flax seed to take . the reason is that when i take ground flax it stops me up big time … .and yes i do drink water about 2 to 3qts a day . i am vegan so i really dont know what to do . was taking 2tbs a day with my salad in the evening . i am a breast cancer survivor and have high triglycerides at 187 but that is better then 2 years ago when it was 258 before i went vegan . its going down slowly was hoping flax would help . anyone else have this problem with flax ? thanksdo you mean it causes you constipation ? this would be very odd , as flax is not a low fiber food , but is actually quite high in fiber . do you mix it with with other foods , such as oatmeal ? i have a hard time going to the bathroom when i use flax not hard stool its soft but hard to come out , and i go very little once a day , strange as it may seem . but when i do not use it i have my normal bm ’ s twice a day without any problems . i do mix it with other food like my large dinner salads or sprinkled in my homemade vegan soup . only like oatmeal with sugar and butter and since i do not eat butter or processed foods like sugar i stay away from it . was wondering maybe i need more water say a qt 30min after a meal .. just guessing . thanks : ) that is very strange , and i wonder if it truly is the flax causing your digestive “ back up ” .ps. i have oatmeal every morning for breakfast , and what i find to be very tasty is when i have bananas , date sugar ( ground dates ) , walnuts , raisins , ground flax and ceylon cinnamon . the large walnut halves taste almost buttery to me . also , thick rolled oats makes the whole difference and tastes far better then regular rolled and much better then quick.hummm i will try the oatmeal with the ingred you have mentioned looks good to me .. thanks againtry cutting to 1t , and have it in the morning instead of evening since you ’ ll be moving all day . go from there as far as dose.i love flax , but i also take a teaspoon of chia every day . my triglycerides have been really high , and i have been told that chia may be the culprit . is there any truth to this ? can someone please clarify the actual amount of lignans in chia vs flax ? this video uncharacteristically leaves one wanting for the actual stats and simply states flax is better . come on doc ! ; ) not totally relevant for this video but can ’ t find a more suitable – what about hemp seeds ? how do they compare to flax and chia seeds ? hulled or not hulled ? what about phytoestrogen ? i heard flax is high in this.this article says chia is better , for several reasons.http : / / www.huffingtonpost.ca / 2013 / 07 / 09 / flax-vs-chia _ n _ 3567261.htmlit also says that chia and flax have different kinds of fiber – chia has insoluble and flax has soluble , both of which have different benefits . the author ’ s conclusion was to eat both chia and flax.hi dr. greger , i have uterine fibroids and fibrocystic breast disease . can flax help with these issues ? how about soy ? thank you ! for iodine , is 150 mcg of a supplement ok if it is kelp ? would it be too much to have two tablespoons of flax and two tablespoons of chia a day ? if so , would having one tablespoon of chia and one tablespoon of flax be a healthier balance ( with the fiber ) compared to two tablespoons of flax a day ?

PLAIN-3280	brown rice vs. black rice you know the answer to this question , white rice versus brown rice . but what about the answer to this question : brown rice versus red rice . ah , what the heck : brown , versus red , versus black rice . which is healthier ? and the winner is … red rice ! that was a surpise — i ’ ve been using black , but i just switched to red . ten times more antioxidants than brown rice . the phytonutrients in these pigmented strains of rice may protect against heart disease , inhibit the growth of human cancer cells , and even help protect against asthma and hay fever , so i encourage folks to make the switch . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on rice , and antioxidants . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! hi ! thanks for a very informative site ! do you know if red jasmine rice has a lower glycemic index than brown rice ? i agree . it would be nice to see the best type of rice , not from an antioxidant perspective , but from beneficial fiber and glycemic index perspectives . maybe barley is better ? i read something on wikipedia that made me think that the antioxidants in red and black rice don ’ t count “ although anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants in vitro , this antioxidant property is unlikely to be conserved after the plant is consumed . as interpreted by the linus pauling institute and european food safety authority , dietary anthocyanins and other flavonoids have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion . unlike controlled test-tube conditions , the fate of anthocyanins in vivo shows they are poorly conserved ( less than 5 % ) , with most of what is absorbed existing as chemically modified metabolites that are rapidly excreted ” http : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / anthocyanin it is still worth to buy those rices ? they are 2 times more expensive than brown rice where i live.yes , i think so . the fiber and phytonutrient content found in whole grains like rice is beneficial.well this is intriguing , and does not relate only to rice ! after watching this i tried to buy red rice online , but i found all different kinds . is this red rice the one called himalayan ? mary zdrojewski : there are many varieties of red rice . the red pigment comes from antioxidants , so no matter which variety you choose , you will be receiving beneficial antioxidants and phytochemicals . to learn more about antioxidant-containing foods , see the following videos : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / antioxidant-content-of-3139-foods / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / carrots-vs-baby-carrots-2 / why is white rice the worst ? just because it has less nutrients ? what about the lack of insoluble fiber – is that a positive or negative ? hello again adam ! view this video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / great-grain-robbery / as well as read the comments and you will be enlightened further on the harms of white rice ! thanks for the link , but i ’ m not following . it talks about how refining flour makes it lose nutrients , but doesn ’ t specifically talk about rice ( though yes , i assume it loses nutrients too ) .the part about the plaque building up , it still says you need to go on a plant based diet to actually stop or reverse the disease . are there any studies on vegans eating white rice ? from what i ’ ve read , i just don ’ t really see anything proving that white rice is bad.this site even seems to suggest brown rice has more arsenic in it , which is not desirable . and other things i ’ ve read say that brown rice absorbs more water from your body , so it fills you up quicker . does that basically mean it dehydrates you ? i ’ m just trying to learn more , so please enlighten me . : ) these are all good questions , the “ great grain robbery ” can be applied to white rice as well because it is in fact the bran that holds the great majority of the nutrients . similarly to eating an oil , which is all fat and little to no nutrients . white rice is all carb , and an insignificant amount of nutrients . to eat empty calories is never beneficial.we should strive to eat as close to the whole plant food as possible for optimum health . this is what is meant whenever you see or hear the words “ plant based ” said by dr. greger . check out this link dr. greger mentions in the comments “ [ white rice ] actually resulted in millions of deaths from a vitamin deficiency called beri-beri , louise . a very dark time in nutrition history . ” here is the medical review link http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2889456 / pdf / medhis5403-02-295.pdfwhenever you eat brown rice , similarly to whole wheat pasta , it already contains water in it since it was boiled . therefore , to absorb even more water within your body doesn ’ t make a lot of sense . what is meant by the statement you quoted is that you are taking into account water weight when you eat brown rice so you will get full quicker because it takes up more space due to the liquid absorption from boiling . this is a good thing ! in regards to the arsenic issue , i agree , it makes me uneasy that a healthy food can contain arsenic , so that is up to you to whether or not to eat rice . but if you do , choose us grown , and always brown rice.thank you for the detailed response ! i really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions.ok , so brown rice has more nutrition than white rice … but isn ’ t it still a “ good ” carb ? i know what you mean by empty calories , but comparing oils and white rice is a stretch in my opinion . much better to eat 500 calories worth of white rice than oil , right ? not all empty cals are the same . even 500 calories of white rice compared to processed white bread … the white rice is still way better , correct ? and does white rice not digest and get assimilated into the body more easily than brown rice , which could be important for athletes who need to fuel up on carbs ? looking forward to your responses ! : ) i don ’ t think white rice is bad because as the china study and mcdougall mention , asian countries thrive on a diet with white rice . although brown rice may have more nutrients , but i wouldn ’ t say that white rice is bad.i would assume european grown rice would have less arsenic since they banned arsenic based food-stocks . not that i know how to buy whole grain european rice … you are correct , oil and rice have different health values but i was just going for the analogy here . i would also agree with you that white rice is better than white bread because more of the whole plant is intact . i will say though , that brown rice will keep you full longer , providing more energy , and will also satiate your vitamin needs better , as you well know . white rice is in fact more easily digested because their is less bran to it but again , this is considered empty calories . i highly encourage you to view the world health organization ’ s view on white rice vs brown. http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = foodspice & dbid = 128 # healthbenefitsif you have a choice between the two , choose brown rice . i myself am a sponsored rock climber and brown rice really keeps me full for a long time . i don ’ t feel sluggish either , its consistent energy.this link will fully answer that question for you.http : / / healthyguy.com / brown _ rice.pdfis there any danger to not washing black or red rice before cooking ? it seems like a substantial proportion of the pigment washes away in the wash water.debrichards : great question and i hope that someone answers it ! to add to the discussion : i don ’ t bother washing my rice , and i still see a lot of pigment come out in the method that i use to cook the rice : casserole method in a pressure cooker . when i see that red-tinted water at the bottom of the pan , i wince , thinking that i must be loosing a lot of nutrients . but if so , those nutrients are rising with the steam over the edge of a glass bowl and then falling to the bottom of the pan.i wouldn ’ t worry so much about the loss of nutrients which in itself would not be dangerous . however washing is a good idea as it can avoid contaminants and food borne illnesses that might have been introduced by harvesting and packaging . obviously buying organic is better see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / can-pesticides-be-rinsed-off / and avoiding animal products substantially reduce pollutants compared to plant based http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / industrial-pollutants-in-vegans / but organic foods can still be contaminated . so i would continue washing.i just purchased a zojirushi rice cooker that has a gaba ( gamma-aminobutyric acid ) setting to cook brown rice ( add two hours at 104 degrees to activate the rice ) that claims to increase to 150 % of the amount of gaba contained in non-activated brown rice , which it further claims to lower blood pressure and relieve stress.it seems to be a pretty lofty claim , but i cannot seem to find any scientific information to support it.i wanted to know whether it is worthwhile to cook brown rice on this setting , given the additional cooking time , and use of energy.it might depend on whether you just want to live a healthy lifestyle or whether you need to bring cholesterol down quickly . my assumption is that you don ’ t need optimal , but only enough to make steady progress on reducing atherosclerosis . but i don ’ t have any personal knowledge on the biochemistry.i won ’ t weigh in on the issues of gaba except to say i haven ’ t seen any studies to support their claims and until i see credible evidence i will remain skeptical . you did ask about how to minimize the reactions to folks when you “ come out of the closet ” as a person following a plant based diet … i prefer to vegan after my biking buddies starting accusing me of being from the planet , vegan ! . the best approach is the one recommended by doug lisle phd . you can order his dvd , the pleasure trap , from the john mcdougall website . it is very entertaining and contains three talks . the last one , getting along without going along , is the best approach i ’ ve come across . it involves the importance of status within groups . i could try and explain but really couldn ’ t do it justice . it is practical and effective.thanks , i will check it out.hi dr. greger , i just had a question about the red rice . i took a quick look at the studies you cited and was wondering where it says that the red rice is higher in antioxidants ? i couldn ’ t find that study . it looked like they all reference black rice . am i looking at the wrong stuff ? thanks ! emily : ) i keep finding chinese black and red rice , but i know that this should have higher arsenic levels because it was shipped from china . does this rule apply to black and red rice like i know it does for brown ? i just got back from a dinner with dr greger . someone noted there are many varieties of red rice and asked what kind of red rice to buy ? his reply was it didn ’ t matter and to buy whatever is cheapest . he also confirmed in answer to another question that “ red yeast rice ” is different than “ red rice ” and is not what he was talking about here.btw , ayurveda ’ s caraka samhita said red rice ( raktasali ) was best thousands of years ago . : ) worth checking out other grains , like barley for “ general equilibrium ” and job ’ s tears “ nothing more reducing / slimming . ” for some context , please check out my associated blog post the best foods : test your nutrition knowledge ! can you somehow raise the volume on these older topics ?

? what about the arsen in rice ? is it found in all these kinds ? hello doc , thanks for all your wonderfully informative ( & often entertaining ) video ” s.question regarding the “ red rice ” … what kind is it ? found some at a indian grocery store … are there different kinds ? you said you switched to red rice … where do you get yours ? cheers , rkrk : thought i would share my experience with red rice : i can get it really cheap at our local asian store . but i can ’ t get it organic there . i can also get it at our “ health food ” ? grocery store , market of choice . but at market of choice , it is very expensive . on the plus side , it is organic and one brand is even fair trade.as for different kinds : i ’ ve used both long and short grain red rice . the short grain red rice is like typical brown rice in texture , where “ typical ” is what i grew up with anyway . the long grain red rice is like brown basmatti rice – at least i think so . the point is that there are different varieties and textures.hope that helps.thanks for the info ! i understand that it is recommended to get organic for fruits and veggies because of pesticides and gmo … but is that recommended for rice too ? i have been tempted by the red rice on sale at chinese markets . however i find myself worrying about additives , dyes , and heck even lead paint . by now we ’ ve just heard it all about products coming from some parts of the world . the news is replete with goods like plastic seaweed ( like shredded garbage bag ) in soups , city-caught pigeons sold in restaurants as “ quail ” all over the us east coast in chinese restaurants , etc . and i ’ m too cheap to buy it at a pricey organic grocer . that ’ s why i personally don ’ t eat it.hello doc , have a question on cooking methods of rice versus it ’ s nutrition value ! a relative told me that cooking rice with excess water and then filter / throwing out the excess water , is healthier option since it will drain excess starch ! is there any truth to this ? does cooking method affect nutrition in rice ? thanks , rkif you don ’ t want to waste your starchy rice wash : 1 ) asian women use rice wash as a facial wash / treatment for beautiful skin . it is the same ph as the human skin . 2 ) it can also be left overnight for 1-4 nights and is great for your garden or houseplants . it is slightly alkaline especially after the first washout which is slightly acidic . 3 ) by adding a small amount of yogurt or kefir you can let it sit for 2 days while lactobacillus colonizes the starch . this is great for pets or gardens . some people say they do this and drink it as a probiotic , but i would never do that myself or advise it for human consumption.it ’ s here that my nutritional existential questions are answered . = dwhat is the best rice for good carbshi . i was told that basmati rice is whole grain rice . i haven ’ t been able to find any documentation that supports that and i was wondering if you know the answer ? i love basmati rice.ellie : i am not an authority on this topic , but i can tell you that a couple years ago , i bought a package of “ brown basmati rice ” . because there can be a brown one and a white one , that says to me that unless the basmati is labeled as “ brown ” , you are not really getting what people typically mean by whole grain.now , i don ’ t know if that is really true . maybe all basmati rice is really brown and they just added that to the package i bought for marketing purposes ? the issue of brown vs non-labeled basmati is worth investigating if you eat a lot of basmati rice , and i ’ m thinking this post will give you a clue on how to search.good luck.what about red quinoa is it better than black & white quinoa ? which type of quinoa is lower in fodmaps , i can ’ t find anything on it after a google search . thanks ! also if you can ’ t eat much fibre , parboilled rice is a better option than white rice because the process ( soaking & steaming ) keeps some of the b vitaminsdoc – your reference sources are showing black rice not red rice ; am i missing something here ? how do the levels of arsenic in red and black rice compare to levels in brown and white rice ? what has more anthocyanins ? black rice or red rice . it looks to me that black rice might have more anthocyanins . can someone clarify ? what is more important when fighting cancer , anthocyanins or antioxidants ? anthocyanins are one specific type of antioxidant , of which there are many types . it ’ s like a sea bass is just one type of many types of fish.the japanese tend to combine red , black , millet , and several brown rices together and sell as a health food rice . they are probably on to something , providing a broad array of minerals and antioxidants with each serving.i personally mix my rices and cook with a zojirushi rice cooker , using its timer function to soak / germinate the rices for about 10 hours ( to get real “ gaba rice ” you need to use the timer to give a long germination period- the standard gaba default setting is a silly 2 hours + 1 hour cook cycle ) , followed by the slow-cooked / low-temp “ gaba ” setting to preserve nutrients , enzymes , and antioxidants as much as possible.hello ! unfortunately , i am one of those people who prefer white rice over brown rice just because i think white rice tastes better . but , recently , i have been using brown rice to make my vegan sushi . but i was wondering , and i did not find the answer on this website , if sushi vinegar is a healty option to flavor the rice ?

PLAIN-3301	amalgam fillings vs. canned tuna because mercury can be so dangerous , concern has been raised about amalgam fillings , the silvery cavity fillings in our teeth , because they do contain mercury and release a certain amount every day . eating just a single can of tuna a week , is the equivalent to having how many mercury-containing fillings in our teeth , day in and day out ? less than 5 , 5-10 , 11-15 , 16-20 , 21-25 , or more than 25 ? now keep i mind , you only have 32 teeth . one can a week , is like living with , 29 mercury-containing fillings . i don ’ t know if you remember those old james bond flicks , but basically that means looking like this . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on mercury and tuna . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! i recently found out that amalgam fillings in the teeth release mercury and i have about 4-5 of such fillings ; should i remove them ? are there scientific articles encouraging it ’ s removal ? i found this organization / video on the web touting for its removal because of it ’ s neurotoxicity : http : / / www.iaomt.org / patients / video.asp are there risks of removing them ? thanks in anticipation of your response.dear dr. greger : first of all , let me thank you for your excellent work here . it really helped me and i ’ m sure it will help others a lot . i ’ ve been ovolactovegetarian since i was 4 , and now i ’ m a vegan for almost 2 years . i ’ m also an odontology student , so i ’ m not only interested in nutrition but also in the subjects related to my career . i was told in the university that amalgam fillings release a minimal amount of mercury a day , so it ’ s not relevant as a health issue , ¿ what do you think about it ? . i would feel sorry about all the patients i put those grey fillings in if i knew they ’ re bad for health . responding to those wondering if there is a risk removing amalgam fillings , yes there is : the risk that your dentist removes additional tooth material by expanding the cavity every time they remove it , either by iatrogenesis or because there is a caries under the filling . another risk may occur because of the swallowing of the filling material , because of that , the dentist should always use a rubber dam before removing the amalgam fillings.i ’ ve read that albacore tuna is bad but that chunk light tuna is safe and has safe levels of mercury ( if there is such a thing ) . is that true ? hi mjeejsmith , as we have learned , all types of tuna contain dangerous levels of mercury . this other video also shows the staggering levels of mercury in tuna : ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2 / ) hello mjeejsmith ! just to expand on nickyc ’ s comment , nicky is correct . a safe level of a toxin should always be 0 . mercury is stored in fat and it can take years for you to actually remove the mercury from your body . check out this video regarding fish contamination http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / hair-testing-for-mercury / as with regarding the different types of tuna , check out the environmental defense fund ’ s website http : / / apps.edf.org / page.cfm ? tagid = 16314 and they show the tunas with the lowest levels . but again , these levels of mercury are considered “ moderate ” and other contaminants are excluded . especially when they say eat no more than 4 servings of us / canadian albacore a month , you know there is something harmful just in that statement . seafood now a days can be considered where the sewage winds up , they are almost always contaminated with a wide range of harmful chemicals , from pcb ’ s , mercury and dioxins to arsenic . these chemicals are difficult to remove from ones system so we should not eat these foods as to avoid replenishing the supply of toxins in our body . check out this video for more information on fish contamination http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / food-sources-of-pcb-chemical-pollutants / interested in the same previoos question about albacore and chunk light tuna.hi lina , as i posted above , all types of tuna contain dangerous levels of mercury , and therefore should be avoided . check out this video for more information : ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / mercury-in-vaccinations-vs-tuna-2 / ) i have lots of fillings in my teeth . is there anything i can do apart from removing them ? .i read that sardines are better than tuna regading mercury . also , from the nutrition data i see they have more omega 3 . what about mackerel ? almost all fish are contaminated by mercury . so to minimized the ingestion of mercury it is best to avoid all fish . see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / hair-testing-for-mercury / . i know of no credible sources recommending removal of fillings to reduce mercury load in the body . omega 3 ’ s are best consumed through natural sources ( flax and walnuts ) or by taking algae derived omega3 ’ s ( which is where the fish get it anyway ) … see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / algae-based-dha-vs-flax-2 / . by avoiding fish you also avoid all the cholesterol , saturated fat plus all other contaminants such as pcb ’ s.please not there are other countries apart from the us . not all supplements are available everywhere.does anyone know a good place where you could go to test your mercury level- like doing a mercury hair test ? dr. greger , with regard to your video : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / amalgam-fillings-vs-canned-tuna / i recently found out that amalgam fillings in the teeth release mercury and i have about 4-5 of such fillings ; should i remove them ? are there scientific articles encouraging it ’ s removal ? i found this organization / video on the web touting for its removal because of it ’ s neurotoxicity : http : / / www.iaomt.org / patients / video.asp are there risks of removing them ? i am confused because some people say that the exposure from amalgam is not sufficient to result in any health issues , and that taking out the fillings could cause more problems ( i.e. weakening the tooth more , and increasing mercury exposure in the process ) .to further compound this case , the alternative to amalgam ( composite resins / fillings ) have also proven to be equally or even more toxic compared to amalgam . i have read several scientific articles and they seem to contradict one another.thanks in anticipation of your response.dr. greger , thanks again for this incredibly informative website . i love it.a question : how did you come up with your calculation about how many mercury-containing dental fillings are equivalent to eating a can of tuna once a week ? ” three national brands of canned tuna were recently tested for mercury . they averaged 600 ppb of mercury , exceeding the u.s. environmental protection agency ’ s safety level for human consumption ( 500 ppb ) . the drained solids in a can of tuna weigh about 170 grams , so that comes out to be about 100 mcg of mercury per can of tuna . a conservative estimate of the amount of mercury we ’ re exposed to on a daily basis per amalgam-filled tooth is 0.5 mcg , so eating a single can of tunafish a week is like having 29 teeth filled with mercury-based fillings day in and day out.i think your numbers are off , so i put together my own comparison with details that you did not address. http : / / www.mercuryexposure.info / context / debunking-amalgam-myths / more-mercury-in-a-tuna-sandwich / item / 842-is-there-more-mercury-in-a-tuna-sandwich-compared-to-mercury-dental-fillings we might also want to factor in exposure during placement polishing and removal . check out richardson ’ s other published study , “ inhalation of mercury-contaminated particulate matter by dentists : an overlooked occupational risk ” http : / / www.mercuryexposure.info / occupational / mercury-exposure / item / 576-inhalation-of-mercury-contaminated-particulate-matter-by-dentists-an-overlooked-occupational-riskmaybe instead of removing amalgams and cause problems it is better to take a supplement that captures the mercury . i read selenium is good but have no experience.does this come from the tuna or the can ? ? what about all canned food ? i didn ’ t find any video in this concern ? ? ? that ’ s from the tuna itself , due to biomagnification up the food chain of the mercury largely released from burning coal.thank you , is there anything there to know about canned food too ? thank you , anything there to know about canned food too ? see bpa plastic and male sexual dysfunction and which plastics are harmful ? .i ’ m not sure if this is still open as the last comment was a year ago but i will give it a go . i have to have a filling replaced and my dentist said the only option is a mercury amalgam filling due to the size and shape of the cavity . i am a nursing mother . is it safe for me to have my tooth filled or should i wait ? there is too much conflicting info out there . thank you.you can always get a second opinion.according to the world health organization – mercury is toxic to human health , posing a particular threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life . mercury exists in various forms : elemental ( or metallic ) ; inorganic ( e.g. mercuric chloride ) ; and organic ( e.g. , methyl- and ethylmercury ) , which all have different toxic effects , including on the nervous , digestive and immune systems , and on lungs , kidneys , skin and eyes.mercury is highly toxic , especially when metabolized into methyl mercury . it may be fatal if inhaled and harmful if absorbed through the skin . around 80 % of the inhaled mercury vapour is absorbed in the blood through the lungs . it may cause harmful effects to the nervous , digestive , respiratory , immune systems and to the kidneys , besides causing lung damage . adverse health effects from mercury exposure can be : tremors , impaired vision and hearing , paralysis , insomnia , emotional instability , developmental deficits during fetal development , and attention deficit and developmental delays during childhood . recent studies suggest that mercury may have no threshold below which some adverse effects do not occur.dental amalgam is the most commonly used dental filling material . it is a mixture of mercury and a metal alloy . the normal composition is 45-55 % mercury ; approximately 30 % silver and other metals such as copper , tin and zinc . in 1991 , the world health organization confirmed that mercury contained in dental amalgam is the greatest source of mercury vapour in non-industrialized settings , exposing the concerned population to mercury levels significantly exceeding those set for food and for air . ( source : http : / / www.who.int / ipcs / publications / cicad / en / cicad50.pdf ) here is a much more detailed and nuanced breakdown of this comparision from the researcher who dr. greger quotes for his amalgma numbers.http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = adpgsbi7u7q & list = uufe7zywoanrkdl0c _ mx757a & index = 5as this is a relevant topic , i was wondering ? root canal treatment ? its a dental procedure and even though there are surplus files and documents spilling around the internet about faulty metal hips and metal teeth ( such as above ) is there any real evidence linking root canal dental procedures with cancer ? the idea about an abscess growing back in a dead tooth and mutating into something cancerous with no nerve sounds logical , but is there anything solid to note ? i would think that nerve damage is a lot more likely than cancer , but i wouldn ’ t rule cancer out . especially if you are including “ local ” cancers , like you can get mouth cancers from chewing tobacco over the years.i don ’ t know if this guide is a reliable or biased source , but maybe it can add some nuance about mercury levels in different fish http : / / www.nrdc.org / oceans / seafoodguide / page4.aspend scene : james bond and jaws from moonraker.interesting to hear the opinions and research findings ; however , i must consider one thing that no one has mentioned , according to my reading of these entries . when calculating “ acceptable ” and “ dangerous ” levels of the differing types of mercury , i hear people relating to tuna sandwiches and cancer rates . i haven ’ t heard anyone mention the presence of carcinogenic elements of enriched , processed flour and mayonnaise in the sandwich equation . also , i haven ’ t heard anyone mention that cancer was virtually unknown before the “ modern ” age . example : several thousand mummies were autopsied to check for cancer presence in the non-modern or pre-modern age . only one case of cancer was found – in thousands ! ! now , we know that one in three to four people will be impacted by cancer . one in six men are already impacted by prostate cancer . at what level of exposure do we finally say , well , that ’ s acceptable to me ? ! ? ! we have made a fine art of processing , transporting and storing food . we experience a constant barrage of microwave and radio wave transmission penetrating our body , 24 hours per day , so that we can enjoy soap operas , satellite tv , cell phone and internet communication . we watch kids eating skittles and popsicles without giving it a second thought . cattle and chickens are fed concoctions that make them grow fast and infection free only as long as it takes to slaughter them , so we can cook them ( and their man-made body chemistry ) in oils from genetically modified corn and soybeans . at what point do we separate the fish mercury from the rest of life on modern earth and define a formula to evaluate amalgam fillings ? how do sardines fit into this picture ? hi rb99 . good question . i think sardines would have lower mercury levels than tuna ( most other fish do ) since they just eat plankton . they still have mercury from what i gather , but i am unsure exact amounts . it appears contaminates can vary based on location and type of fish . a study from the u.s. shows doses of lead , cadmium and arsenic in canned sardines . this study in port moresby tested different levels of fish and found sardines to be the lowest . i am not sure any level of mercury is safe . some other videos that mention sardines and if interested , here and here . one video is on atrial fibrillation , the other on amnesic seafood poisoning.i wonder how incompetent you are ? corelation dont imply causation . check maybe japanese nation with highest fish consuption rates and why we dont see any problems there in the cognitive tests ? .please no name calling on the site . this video is about canned tuna and fillings not japanese populations and cognition . thanks. amalgam fillings , cans , dental health , fish , mercury , neurotoxins , oral health , seafood , tuna eating a can of tuna once a week is equivalent to living with how many mercury-containing amalgam tooth fillings ? still interested in mercury exposure ? see my videos : mercury vs. omega-3s for brain development hair testing for mercury before considering pregnancy nerves of mercury how long to detox from fish before pregnancy ? fish intake associated with brain40 shrinkage which brand of tuna has the most mercury ? pollutants in salmon and our own fatplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on mercury and tuna . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well !

PLAIN-3321	# 1 anticancer vegetable but anyway , back to beans . in terms of nutrient density , nutrients per calorie : are beans the most nutritious class of whole foods ? or is it fruit , nuts and seeds , vegetables , or whole grains ? what should go on the base of a healthy eating pyramid ? beans , fruits , nuts , veggies , or grains ? definitely vegetables , but which are the healthiest ones ? a major advance was made this year ranking vegetables . graphs like this that i ’ ve shared over the years that compare the antioxidant power of foods were all based on very primitive methods — basically just measuring how much a food slows down an oxidation reaction between two chemicals in a machine . that was the best we had , but it required a leap of faith that what was happening in the test tube could be extrapolated to what might happen in living human tissue . this year , though , a landmark study was published , pitting 34 common vegetables against 8 different types of human cancers . breast cancer , brain tumors , kidney cancer , lung cancer , childhood brain tumors , pancreatic cancer , prostate cancer , and stomach cancer . let ’ s look at breast cancer — i ’ ll cover up the . what ’ s being measured is tumor cell proliferation . here ’ s the control . you drip some water on a human breast tumor , and nothing happens — it ’ s still powering away at 100 % growth rate . and these 7 vegetables appear useless against breast cancer , no different than placebo . but these 6 cut the cancer growth rate in half . and these 5 at the end stopped cancer growth completely — stopped these tumor cells dead in their tracks . take-home message # 1 : we need to eat a portfolio of vegetables . take a look : radishes , do nothing against pancreatic cancer , in fact if anything they might accelerate growth but , against stomach cancer , they completely eliminated tumor cell growth . on the other hand , orange bell peppers don ’ t do much for stomach cancer , but can cut prostate cancer growth by more than 75 % . so we need to eat a variety of vegetables , because each one tends to target different cancers . if you ’ re particularly concerned about a specific cancer , like if you have a strong family history of breast cancer , then you can narrow it down and really nail those 5 or 6 veggies every day that excel at targeting breast tissue . but otherwise , to fight against any kind of cancer , we ’ ve got to eat a portfolio of vegetables to cover all our bases . that doesn ’ t mean some veggies aren ’ t better than others . some of these vegetables target multiple cancers at the same time . so using this groundbreaking new data , let ’ s play “ which is healthier . ” imagine you ’ re standing in line at one of those custom made-to-order salad places , where you get to choose your lettuce , choose your toppings , then choose your dressing . lets assume that you don ’ t have a strong family history of any particular cancer , and so aren ’ t trying to hone in on avoiding one tumor over another . first , let ’ s choose our lettuce . boston , endive , radicchio , romaine , or spinach ? out of the five , spinach is # 1 against breast cancer — remember , the farther right the better it is at slowing down these cancer cells . # 1 against brain tumors , # 1 against kidney cancer , # 1 against lung cancer , # 1 against pediatric brain tumors — feed your kids spinach ! # 1 against pancreatic cancer , prostate cancer , and # 1 against stomach cancer . now note it ’ s not # 1 overall — there are 16 vegetables more powerful at stopping stomach cancer growth than spinach , but out of those five salad greens , spinach wins out across the board , against every cancer type tested . what if the salad place said they were out of spinach , though ? which comes in second out of the four left to choose from . for breast cancer , radicchio is # 2. against brain tumors. radicchio , kidney cancer , radicchio , radicchio , romaine , radicchio , radicchio , and radicchio . so overall , out of those choices for greens , radicchio is number 2 . back to the menu . next we get to choose 4 toppings . now there ’ s a long line of people behind you , all staring at you to make your choice . you don ’ t have time to ponder and pick the 4 absolute best , but you can at least make a guess as to roughly where on the graph they are . yes or no ? according to this amazing new data , do carrots slow cancer cell growth rates more than 50 % ? yes or no ? the answer is no . no , no , no , no , no , no , and no . so shredded carrots aren ’ t going to make our top four toppings choice.what about shredded beets ? yes or no ? yes . super yes ! brain tumor ? just beet it . kidney cancer is a no , close to 50 % , but not quite there . and then yes , yes , yes , yes , yes . so overall , yes for beets.are we putting cucumber on out salad ? yes ? no ? as tasty as they may be … no . for most cancers it suppressed tumor cell growth less than 50 % what about a tomato ? yes or no ? no tomato either . what about a potato ? you can actually put potatoes onto your salad . yes or no ? no potato either . wait a second , no iceberg lettuce , carrots , cucumber , tomatos , potatos — that ’ s all people eat ! that ’ s the problem . even people eating their vegetables , aren ’ t really eating their vegetables . the majority of veggies people commonly eat have little effect . cutting to the chase : the line at the salad place is now out the door at this point . in this study there was one clear winner . one vegetable that completely 100 % stopped cancer growth in 7 out of the 8 tumor lines . one of the most important findings of the year : which vegetable was it ? was it bok choi ? broccoli . brussel sprouts , fiddlehead ferns , garlic , kale , or red cabbage ? number one against breast cancer ? garlic . number one against brain tumors : garlic . number two against kidney cancer : garlic . lung cancer : garlic . childhood brain tumors : garlic . pancreatic cancer : garlic . prostate cancer : garlic . and stomach cancer ? garlic . so might i suggest a garlicky salad dressing ? wait a second , though . is it just that garlic is toxic to all cells ? yes , it stops the growth of cancer cells , but maybe it stops the growth of healthy cells too ? that wouldn ’ t be good . they tested for that . the black bars are cancer cells ; the white bars are normal cells . as you can see garlic slams cancer cells , but doesn ’ t touch normal cells , and the same thing with pretty much all the vegetables . they ’ re selective ; they go after the cancer cells but leave the normal cells alone . veggies are amazing . now if you didn ’ t pick garlic and instead chose one of those others you probably weren ’ t far off . the two best families of vegetables for cancer prevention are the cruciferous vegetables , like broccoli , kale , cabbage , and the allium family vegetables , like garlic , onions , and leeks . let me just run through this one last time to highlight this important fact . starting from the beginning . cruciferous vegetables in green ; allium vegetables in yellow . what i want you to notice is the clustering of colors over on the right side , which illustrates the power of these two superfood classes of vegetables . whether for breast cancer , brain cancer , kidney cancer , lung cancer , or brain cancer . interestingly you ’ ll notice that bok choy is often the odd one out , apparently the least healthy of the cruciferous vegetables . pancreatic cancer , prostate cancer , and finally stomach cancer . so you know all those recipes that start with garlic and onions and then throw you in some greens — that , is the way to eat . the researchers conclude : “ the inclusion of cruciferous and allium vegetables in the diet is essential for effective dietary-based chemopreventive strategies . ” this is the most informative health video i have ever seen , thank you ! don ’ t forget to check out part 1 of this video ( kind of like the prequel : ) just to put it in context.incredible as alwaysdefinitely one of my favorites ! amazing and life changing.definitely changed the way my family now eats ! dr. gregor , i tried to post this earlier but it didn ’ t post . how do you feel about all the people out there claiming that garlic harms brain cells , alters proper brain functioning , and other negative effects ? there is no shortage of people who feel that garlic causes them a lack of mental clarity , and a disruption of what “ feels ” normal . a lot of the evidence is anecdotal , but do you really think nature wants us biting into a garlic bulb ? it seems to me that our taste buds suggests we don ’ t do that . any credible studies you are aware of in the negative consequences of garlic consumption ? much thanks.which vegetables are best for fighting the spread of prostate cancer , i can ’ t find the list . i think your website is terrific , good job with this and the friendly narrations are perfect .according to dr. campbell in “ the china study ” , not eating dairy , which causes the cancer cells to grow , is a great start . cooking the cruciferous veggies half an hour to get rid of the goitrogen , which prevents one from losing weight , is another.i figured it out by stopping the video turning my head and copying the top 10 under the prostate chart . garlic is # 1 and cabbage is a about 10th . once again , great great websitesorry about the neck strain ! if there ’ s anything you can ’ t read let me know and i can post a larger image in the supplementary info section.i ’ m guessing that 50 cents i spent on a bulb of garlic was money well spent ! thanks for such a great resource ! are these best consumed raw or cooked ! ? ! he replied elsewhere that if you cook garlic you should wait ten minutes first to allow the beneficial compounds to form.the most helpful cancer preventive video i have ever seen . thank you ! jennifer – great question ! dr greger has a few videos on the topic of cooking methods and the effects on nutrients . in fact there ’ s one video that may be perfect for you : best cooking method . you may also want to look at this article which does a nice overview of some of the other research on the topic.great stuff . what about mushrooms ? i understand they are great , and they are usually on the salad bar menu . any intel to share ? mushrooms are great for us ! they are good against breast cancer and are high in antioxidants. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / vegetables-versus-breast-cancer / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / the-best-mushroom-2 / the only issue with mushrooms is that we should avoid eating them raw as they have a natural toxin called agaratine in them that is destroyed by cooking. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / toxins-in-raw-mushrooms / awesome video , dr. greger ! i am left with the question of the anticancer effects of raw vs. cooked garlic and onions . i know cooking reduces some of the nutrients but have raw and cooked alliums been tested in regard to the anti-cancer effects ? in other words is it important to try to consume these raw notwithstanding their very strong flavors ? the secret to maintaining the anti-cancer effects of garlic is to either eat it raw ( think salsa , homemade dressings , pesto , etc ) or crush the garlic first , wait ten minutes , and then cook it . you know those chemical flares ? you bend them , two chemicals mix and a light-emitting reaction takes place ? the same kind of thing happens in garlic . floating around in the cytoplasm of garlic cells is a compound called alliin and packed away in tiny intracellular storage compartments ( called vacuoles ) is an enzyme called alliinase . when the garlic tissues are crushed , the two mix and alliinase turns alliin into allicin , the phytonutrient thought to be responsible for many of garlic ’ s health benefits . cooking destroys the enzyme , though , so even if you crush your garlic , if it ’ s thrown immediately into the pan , little allicin may be produced . allicin is relatively heat stable , though , so if you chop your garlic and wait 10 minutes for the allicin to be formed , you can then cook it ( the enzyme has already done its work ) and presumably maintain many of the benefits.hard to follow the chemical ways of the garlic , but thanks for posting that it is best eaten raw and if cooked to wait 10 mins . i get stomach discomfort when i eat garlic ( i think ) it is hard to tell what is doing it , because i get the same problem with other things . i wish i could figure it out . anyone have any ideas about how to go about figuring out what is bothering your stomach ? to really know what is bothering your stomach , i would suggest starting with a food diary or journal . keep track of what you eat , how you feel , and the timing between the food and the feeling.you will begin to see a pattern . keep in mind that if you are mixing foods you may not get a true picture of the culprit . but then take the foods one at a time , and journal . its a puzzle to be solved ! woah ! will remember this.in this video http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = jwf8fpne4wcgarlic is mentioned , it appears that the garlic oil is an important factor therefore the dried garlic ( unless fried-oxidized ) does not have these properties as raw.mike thanks for sharing , this video is so interesting ! ! ! i remember learning about this in april 2011 while my mother was dying from pancreatic cancer at the cleaveland clinic . thanks ( whole heartedly ) for the great summary and info re the alliinase , allin , allicin and all the info i ’ ve gleaned elsewhere , including nitrites , nitritates , nitric oxide , nitrisamines ( sp ) etcis it true that according to japanese research , bananas may be better for us as they ripen and the black spots appear on the skin ? ( some tlc factor or something to that effect ? : - ) i love this video so much , thank you ! my question is should i consume the veggies / garlic , etc raw or cooked ? i like to do greensmoothies and juice , raw of course , are they veggies less anticancer if i cook them ? ? also how much daily should i eat ? ex.- like 2 raw cloves of garlic in a savory smoothie ? any thoughts ? thanks , paulathanks for your question paulapooh . please see my answer to michelle above.thank you ! i am surprised to learn that carrots didn ’ t do much in this study to block cancer growth … as it is heavily used in the gerson therapy to fight / prevent cancer … very odd ! did anyone else notice that ? thanks.i actually have a video coming our about gerson therapy – stay tuned ! unfortunately the data does not look good : ( wow , oh no , i ’ m looking fwd to seeing that video ! thanks for all your hard work and research ! that is a great video and sort of an eye opener . when it comes to garlic ; how about the odorless or capsuled oils preparations ? are these any good ? great question . i am curious about the prepared crushed garlic that comes in a jar too … is it any good ? i am guessing these preparations can ’ t be as good as fresh garlic . however , are they better than not eating garlic at all ? i have a question about garlic . from watching the video it is my understanding garlic targest cancer cells but does not hurt regular cells . my first question is does this apply to both raw and cooked garlic and if so is one more effective than the other.my second request is to ask your help in sorting out the conflicting advice on garlic from other authors and researchers who say raw garlic especially is toxic to the body with cooked garlic less so . they say raw garlic can burn tiny holes in the lining of the stomach of some people and it is especially dangerous for people with leaky gut syndrome as the garlic can get in the blood where it is especially dangerous . they also say it is bad for brain cells . please review these two short videos on garlic to see my point on the difficult conflicts in the advice . thank you in advance for your help with sorting this out.http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = pgmbaqnxlcy & feature = relatedhttp : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 14azbjs0miy & feature = relatedi am also curious about these claims . i know dr. greger is focused on evidence-based science . it seems there is far more evidence of the health benefits than there is to support the idea that allium vegetables are toxic . sometimes the lack of studies or evidence can be motivated by industry funding , perhaps this is one of those situations ? if someone could weigh in with some authority on the matter i would also appreciate it.it is pronounced radeekio . : - ) one of my favorite salads starts with wilted chard ; but i didn ’ t see any of the traditional cooked greens — kale , mustard , red / green chard , turnip , collard , etc — in this video . assuming a ) they ’ re gently wilted for the salad , and b ) diners appreciate their more robust texture … how would they compare in terms of cancer prevention ? hey doc , how does a petri dish experiment compare with the human body ? gareyisn ’ t it true though that some of the beneficial compounds don ’ t last long enough inside the human body to reach the tumors ? the study was for extracts applied directly onto cancer cells , no ? dr. greger : where does swiss chard belong on the scale ? i grow a lot of it and freeze it so that i can eat it all year . i use it the same way spinach is used . i much prefer it to spinach , and it is easier to grow in my climate . does it have similar health benefits as spinach ? hi ridley , both the spinach and chard belong to the chenopod family , which also includes quinoa and beets . this is a phytonutrient-packed family of veggies . here ’ s a link if you want to look into the detailed comparison between spinach and swiss chard : http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = foodspice & dbid = 16 also , here ’ s a very interesting study on more anti-cancer properties of plants http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / amla-versus-cancer-cell-growth / do i understand correctly that according to this data bok choy is actually cancer promoting ? i ask because on the charts where lower is better bok choy often scores over 100 % . i also wonder why bok choy would be the odd one out . it is packed with micronutrients and does contain itc ’ s that should be cancer blocking . very strange ! this is a wonderful site i ’ m glad i found it ! i so wish this study covered colon and ovarian cancer . i would love some trust worthy facts on it … i ’ ve been doing a little research and i came up with broccoli , cauliflower , kale , and chai tea . i know its a shocker but you cant believe everything you read on the net … i ’ m still confused on the soy milk in chai tea issue.good too know about the cancer blocking properties of spinach but i have heard lots of accounts from different books etc on how much spinach is safe to eat given the higher levels of oxilates compared to other leafy greens . is there any current guidelines for safe oxilate consumption and how that equates to servings per week for example ? hi adam . while you are correct that spinach has a higher content of oxalates compared to other dark leafy greens , i would argue that unless you are an infant , or someone with a history of oxalate kidney stones , the benefits of spinach definitely outweigh the risks assocaited with its oxalate content . this other video , which discusses oxalate consumption from beets , may be of interest to you : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / asparagus-pee / . that said , everything in moderation . why not diversify your consumption of greens ? some spinach , some kale , some chard , some collards , etc . you can also check out another video that discusses the consumption ( or overconsumption ) of raw greens : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / overdosing-on-greens / .does beets bell peppers with garlic combat prostate canceri noticed cabbage always scores much higher than red cabbage . i assume that ’ s plain green cabbage . that seems counter-intuitive and i think you recommended red cabbage in another video.how much garlic per day should we be eating for these benefits ? how much beet as well ; i heard not to eat too much beet — but how to know how much of what to eat ? ! i noticed that the last part of the video showing yellow for the allium family and green for the cruciferous ( brassica ) family , the rutabagas got left out ! they would add even more green to the chart ! he also forgot that radishes are part of the cruciferous family ( brassicaceae ) ! for some context , please check out my associated blog post the best foods : test your nutrition knowledge ! excellent information.great video presenting vital information . thanks , dr. greger ! may i offer two comments on language from an english and foreign language teacher … first , radicchio is from italian and is pronounced “ rah-deek-ee-o ” … in other words “ ch ” is always pronounced like “ k ” in english in italian . “ ci ” is always pronounced “ chee ” as in “ arriverderci . ” i know i am fighting a losing battle on this second point but i simply must try … “ healthy ” and “ healthful ” are both adjectives . the former refers to the physical ( and mental and so on ) status of anything alive , man , beast , or plant . if , for example , a basil plant is healthy , it is thriving . however , if one is pondering whether basal as a food substance is nutritious , the proper adjective is clearly “ healthful ” or ‘ full of health ” for the eater thereof . as a linguist , i know that the tendency is for all languages to become simpler as they evolve , but must we permit this at the cost of clarityoops , misspelled basil . ( not a complete sentence ) wow , this is an amazing video ! thanks , dr. greger ! ! i do try to focus my eating around the healthiest spectrum of the greens , veggies , and fruits . bok choy and red cabbage were lower on the spectrum than i expected . but that ’ s okay . i ’ ll just eat more leeks , garlic , and onions . i already eat tons of spinach , kale , cauliflower , and broccoli . thanks for this really useful and practical information . i had breast cancer ( stage 0 , surgically removed ) in 2009 , so now i eat ( vegan ) to fight cancer . i make cancer-fighting nutritional smoothies that contain the best cancer fighting nutrients and drink them ( about 20 oz . ) with every meal . and i ’ ve lost 40 pounds doing it … not a bad thing . : ) ~ april1 ) this study was in cell lines , not humans . are there studies out there that corroborate this effect in real life ? 2 ) how much and in what form is necessary ? raw garlic / onions are hard to take in large quantities . does cooking destroy the antiproliferative effect ? 3 ) does a daily , well-rounded vegetarian / vegan diet give sufficient quantities to do the job , or are “ super-quantities ” needed ? thanks for an amazing array of practical health topicsvery informative . just shared with my friends ! very interesting . i ’ ve been taking the newchapter organic garlic force pills for some time . are those kind of supplements any good ? please also check out my associated blog post fighting inflammation with food synergywhat about kale ? your site is amazing . thank you so much . i just posted a link to this video on a private facebook site for a particular cancer . it ’ s worth checking out chinese nutrition therapy , one of the few decent books in english on a chinese medicinal diet . only recently did i notice there was a decent correlation between the vegetables , herbs , oils , nuts , grains & other foods that act on certain organ networks and the data from those studies.excellent pacing and summarizing . good stuff ! both interesting and informative . i love the fact that the presentation is completely based on experiments presented in a peer reviewed medical journal , but in layman terms . @ charlotte , this particular video by dr. greger is powerful indeed ; hope you can also spend an hour of time and watch his “ uprooting the leading causes of death ” dvd that he has so compassionately shared free here on his website , on fb , and on youtube . it is remarkable and wo @ 27e16bfde4827c69112fccc8dafde66b : disqus nderful ! i was with you talking about the salad bar . raw onions and greens are high on my salad ingredients . then you mentioned starting a cooked dish with cooking up the garlic and onions followed by the greens . doesn ’ t cooking remove the very good substances we need ? awesome info … .thanks for sharing ! i will make a green smoothie recipe out of the main ones you listed for my brother who has a brain tumor . hopefully he will get into the habit of having one daily . be careful with that . i got into trouble with mom when she was dying of pancreatic cancer by raising vitamin k levels and perhaps causing blood clots . was giving her a green soup with most of those ingredients . it may or may not have caused the blood clots but i sincerely doubt it did her any good.radicchio is not pronounced with the “ ch ” sound as in chair , but as a “ k ” sound . pronounce like radikio . thought you might want to know . : ) this is fascinating.does this have to be organic ?

i also wanted to be sure : by reducing inflammation in the body with spices and the like , wouldn ’ t it be possible that the body adapts to produce more of these compounds , so as to maintain an homeostatic level in the body ? thank you for any information you can provide ! i was poking around this classic nf video and it was so interesting i got the source article . there are two additional facts about the study ( which dripped vegetable juices on cancer cells ) that might modify our understanding . 1 ) a surprising but very important point was , as a result of the method used to extract the juice from the fresh , raw vegetables , “ the vegetable juices used in this study … do not contain water-insoluble molecules such as lycopene found in tomatoes or beta-carotene found in yellow , orange and green leafy fruits and vegetables , including carrots , spinach and broccoli . it is thus possible that our results underestimate the whole antioxidant and anti-proliferative activities of specific vegetables containing water-insoluble bioactive phytochemicals , ” such as carrots and tomatoes which the video pretty much discounted as useful for purposes of anti-cancer promotion.2 ) since the vegetables in the study were delivered in the form of fresh juice , it is not clear to what degree cooking might affect the results . actually it is clear , as reported in nutritionfacts , that in some bioactive substances are damaged by heating and others are enhanced.yes , healthy eating is not simply about “ more fruit and veggies , ” since which fruits and veggies and how we prepare them also matters . at the same time , we need to find a balance between 1 ) choosing foods and prep methods wisely , and 2 ) not over-thinking it such that eating becomes a over-managed burden.one of the best in nutritionfacts ! ! so tomatoes promote cancer ?

PLAIN-3331	salt ok if blood pressure is ok ? fact or fiction : if your blood pressure is normal , salt is ok . or to put it another way , unless you have high blood pressure , there ’ s no reason to specifically avoid sodium . fact , or fiction ? major fiction . salt does all sorts of bad things to our arteries besides just raising blood pressure , contributing to the deaths of about 150,000 americans every year . so try to keep sodium intake under about 1500mg a day , which means a single slice of bacon could take you over the top for the entire day . which has more sodium , though ? more salt ? a serving of beef , a serving of baked all-natural chicken , a large mcdonald ’ s french fries , or a serving of salted pretzels . it ’ s not the pretzels … or the fries , or the beef . why does straight chicken have so much salt in it ? it ’ s because the poultry industry injects the carcasses with salt water to artificially inflate the weight , and they can still label it 100 % natural . consumer reports found some supermarket chicken so plumped with salt that it registered 840 mg per serving . that ’ s off the charts , like half our days sodium in half a chicken breast . i dont ’ know how to make food taste good without sea-salt . a bowl of soba or rice or even oatmeal just taste bland without salt . soba with garlic and chili still needs salt to bring it to life . what to do ? darned taste buds ! turns out that you can train them to accept a lower level of sodium . i know everything now tastes like cardboard without added salt , but give it 2-3 weeks . that ’ s all it takes to retrain you buds . it ’ s like magic . i know you may not believe me now , but if you actually stick through those few weeks then once your nerves reset , adding any salt at all will make you grimace because it makes things too salty . please give it a try for a few weeks and let me know how it goes.i was already vegetarian for a few years but i decided that i was ready for the final step and dropped dairy , eggs , cooking oils , and salt . that week was hilariously bland , seriously , laugh at it while you can . your taste will quickly return after this period . science ! hi dr greger . what do you think about dr. mcdougall ’ s advice that we should feel free to add as much salt as we want but just eat a whole food starch based diet ? thanks ! i have heard both dr. mcdougall and jeff novick rd weigh in on the issue of salt . at one of dr. mcdougall ’ s advanced i heard one researcher propose the hypothesis that the ratio of sodium to potassium is key . dr. mcdougall says that it is okay to add some salt at the table . i have never heard him say you can add as much salt as you like . it seems like our requirement is about 500 mg per day but most americans are consuming well about 3000 mg and sometimes as much as 10,000 mg per day . the institute of medicine recommendations are less than 2300 mg per day . plants contain more potassium than sodium . see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / 98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient / and http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / preventing-strokes-with-diet / . it is a bit confusing but the bulk of the science keeps coming out reinforcing the value of a whole food plant based diet . don ’ t forget about another salt which can be associated with improved health … magnesium … see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / mineral-of-the-year-magnesium / . a small amount of salt added at the table is a reasonable approach . although many persons don ’ t know where their sodium comes from … see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / salt-ok-if-blood-pressure-is-ok / .one of the reasons i don ’ t eat much cooked food is because whole food starches really have no or little flavor on their own and so you end up dowsing them in salt or slathering them in some sort of fat … i eat mostly fruits and veggies and a minimal amount of nuts and seeds .. no added sodium needed = ) a great way to overcome this is to add lots of herbs and spices . for example , when i am eating brown rice , i dont eat brown rice with plain cooked veggies . i will add to the veggies lots of herbs , garlic and onions , perhaps some balsamic . you can make a variety of dishes this way if you flavor the veggies to put on the rice.i make rice / bean / corn tacos with salsa , mashed potatoes and no fat gravy ( low sodium vegetable broth or white bean sauce ) , cajun sweet potato fries with low sodium ketchup the list goes on and on . i also love fruits and vegetables.i have to say that it absolutely does work . going off , or very much reducing , salt intake brings the taste buds back to life after a couple of weeks ( it seemed to take me just a few days ) . the foods will definitely begin bursting with flavor again . you won ’ t believe it until it ’ s tried.its true , i find salty foods un edible now.i was off salt for months last year ( sometimes just a bit of sea salt ) , and i hated it the whole time. my taste buds did not retrain. eating was lame. when i started using salt again i could actually enjoy food. my name is ioana and i am a salt addict.ioana , i love salt too ! i was actually surprised how easy it was to keep below 1500mg just by eating fruits and vegetables that taste delicious raw , and then sneaking in my salt at dinner . give it a shot ! i don ’ t love salt as much as salt loves me . my brain is programmed that certain things must be part of my cooking and eating olive oil and salt are two . my brain is in the drivers seat as far as these two things are concerned . so i am being sneaky and just reducing the amount of salt i ad a bit at a time . so far so good but just cutting it out would be harsh for me , and my brain would just kick back hard ! ok this might be a stupid question , but here goes . is there a difference between regular table salt and sea salt , as far as one being better for you-or less bad for you , than the other ? i have heard both ways , so i thought i would ask you . thanks ! well , since our food these days is lacking in iodine , i would say iodized table salt is a better option then sea salt . check out dr. greger ’ s video on iodinehttp : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2 / hey , psychwoman1 ! you are not asking a stupid question ; there are many varieties of salt that exist beyond table salt and sea salt . as a connoisseur of salt ( i have over 8 types in my house right now … and no table salt ) , i would be glad to explain the difference . table salt is refined and mostly just plain ol ’ sodium chloride , with some anti-caking agents thrown in . iodine is one additive typically in table salt . sea salt is just your evaporated sea water , which will vary depending on where it ’ s from in the refining , additive , and mineral content . the really good stuff is unrefined salt . these are the only types of salt that i have , and they each contain a variety of minerals that give a unique flavor to the salt . just as the name implies , they are unrefined . some sea salts can be unrefined as well ; i think i have grey sea salt and fleur de sel which are both fantastic and unrefined . i urge you to branch out from table salt , but keep an eye on your iodine levels if you do ! and check out this other video on salt : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / dietary-guidelines-with-a-grain-of-big-salt / chelsea , i already am a lover of ‘ alternate ’ salts : ) my fav is pink himalayan sea salt . i just was curious if it was actually less bad for you than regular ‘ ol table salt , since it is less or not at all refined . i ’ m glad i ’ m not the only one who loves salt ! : ) i am going to try harder to reduce my salt usage , but i think i ’ ll stick with my pink sea salt , and may look for the salts you mention too.if like most americans you are in a zone where less salt would be a healthier change than more sodium , substituting potassium chloride for some of your sodium chloride can help . one of the reasons salt is bad is it can cause potassium deficiency because sodium and potassium uptake are antagonistic.at least that is the version i heard.really … that is very interesting . i wish you could have added a “ study ” or two.there is a difference between taking potassium supplements and replacing part of your sodium with potassium . google says rdi of potassium is 3500 mg vs 2400 sodium , so i am sure that there are some dosage dependencies.all i found was this. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / 98-of-american-diets-potassium-deficient / interesting that this source mentions 4700mg a day minimum.i agree that it would be nice to get confirmation on the uptake antagonism.actually i asked about the salt substitutes you can buy that i believe contain the potassium.she then replied if you want to kill yourself . i do only have one kidney so i wonder if that had a bearing – guess i should have asked.that ’ s probably why.http : / / www.kidneyfund.org / kidney-disease / kidney-friendly-diet-ckd / apparently if you have kidney issues you should try to limit sodium , potassium , and phosphorous . i don ’ t know if “ kidney disease ” should be treated the same as “ only one kidney ” , though.would it be your point of view that salt water would be injected into all or most chicken found in supermarket ? ? how about organic chicken ? most of the conventional chicken is injected with saline solution and you can read how much of the weight is of this salt water on the packaging . as for organic , it is not injected but that doesn ’ t mean organic chicken is healthy.thank-you toxins . i personally do not eat animal “ products ” ‘ ; but i was asking on behalf of the rest of my tribe that does.something to consider with those who eat a diet of mostly fruits and vegetables and who work out a great deal . if you are sweating a lot and eat foods with insufficient sodium , you can develop hyponatremia or low blood sodium . you may feel ill , fatigued , loss of appetite , headache , confusion , vomiting , etc . i experienced this last year for the first time , and it was quite difficult for me to figure out.i was eating a high raw all fruits and vegetable diet , and couldn ’ t even get out of bed in the morning . i thought i caught a bug or had lyme disease . it wasn ’ t until a threw a little salt on my popcorn one evening did i realize what it was . i felt much better in a very short amount of time.moral of the story is that salt is still an essential mineral and you can develop a deficiency.indeed , salt is necessary for health . here is a quote from jeff novick on sodium and sweat loss . “ endurance athletes who work out in high temperatures who are adapted to a high sodium diet can lose sodium though their sweat.however , when one adapts to a low sodium diet , which can take about a week or so , they will lose much less sodium through their sweat and this will not be an issue . ” well , having finished a 4 hr bike ride at 100 f in the back of an ambulance with hyponatremia i can personally attest that insufficient salt can present an acute situation . it can be da ngerous to try to go without salt loading with insufficient salt / hydration skills . what seems to work is not drinking so much , instead pouring freshwater over my head , which reduces sweating and cools you off . still i put a bit of salt in my water and if i ’ m going for a really long ride in the heat i will drink a glass of water with a gram of salt in it before heading out and may drink a v8 ( i know ) at the rest stop.what ’ s wrong with v8 ? i know it has way too much salt , but if you actually want the salt , then why not ? i have been eating high raw for 4 years now , so his theory doesn ’ t apparently work for all people.perhaps the issue of eating purely raw has a role in this , since a raw food diet has many drawbacks to a conventional whole foods plant based diet with cooking.a raw diet has drawbacks ? ok , i ’ ll bite . what is your argument ? dr. greger covers raw food diets in a few of his videos.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / raw-food-diet-myths / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / raw-vs-cooked-broccoli-2 / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / raw-food-nutrient-absorption-2 / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / best-cooking-method / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / raw-food-nutrient-absorption-3 / no evidence shows that a raw diet trumps a conventional whole foods plant based diet , but a lot of evidence shows that mixing cooking with raw is not only healthy , but beneficial.you haven ’ t shown any drawbacks of a raw food diet . you only showed me a couple videos that talked about nutrient absorption . too many people ( yes , even doctors ) have fallen into the myth that more of a nutrient is always better . this has been proven to be a fallacy . many times , too much of a single nutrient can be harmful.in addition , there are tens of thousands of nutrients in raw foods . a good percentage of those nutrients are destroyed during cooking . we haven ’ t even identified all the nutrients in raw plant-foods , so we can ’ t even know exactly how many or which ones are destroyed and how they impact the health of the consumer.if we are to eat like our ancestors and primate relatives , if would be all raw food.show me an epidemiological study showing that raw foodists suffer health consequences from these drawbacks . otherwise , they aren ’ t drawbacks at all.what we absorb is a key indicator of how healthy we are . the fact that it was found that raw foodists have equivalent levels of several antioxidants to that of a standard american diet shows its clear ineffectiveness.you are using the same faulty logic of the paleolithic diet . are you really going to idolize our ancestors who lived till they were 30-40 years old ? as of right now , there are no long term studies on raw foodists , nor is their evidence to support this diet . it is simply a theory . cooking can be viewed as pre digestion , it is not toxic nor is it harmful . if one grills something that is a different story , but gently cooking food provides no issue . “ pre digesting ” food allows us to consume more of it keeping us full for longer periods of time and allows us to absorb more nutrients . complex carbohydrates , such as beans and sweet potatoes depend on being cooked to be consumed.it doesn ’ t matter how our ancestors ate , it matters what the science tells us now . i see no reason to jump on to the raw food bandwagon since this diet is unsupported by any scientific evidence . if you can present some valid studies showing how a raw food diet is healthier compared to a conventional whole food plant based diet then please do so . the burden of proof is on you.don ’ t turn this around on me . you are the one who said raw food diets have a drawback . you haven ’ t shown me any proof . i never said that cooked food diets have a drawback , nor did i said everyone needs to eat a raw food diet . the burden of proof is on you to support your “ drawbacks ” .you claim “ the fact that it was found that raw foodists have equivalent levels of several antioxidants to that of a standard american diet shows its clear ineffectiveness . ” what is your reference that shows these lower levels of anti-oxidants . and what is your reference to show that cooked food vegans showed a higher level.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19940473 http : / / journals.cambridge.org / action / displayabstract ? frompage = online & aid = 1850292i already showed you the evidence , i simply copied these studies right out of dr. greger ’ s videos . so again , where is your proof ? where is my proof of what ? i am not trying to prove anything . you are trying to show me that a raw food diet has drawbacks . i am asking you to provide evidence to your claim . the studies to which you linked do not offer any epidemiological studies that suggest raw food diets have any drawbacks . simply because cooking certain foods increases the absorption of some nutrients does not mean that eating them raw has a drawback . and having lower levels of a certain nutrient does not mean you are deficient . deficient is defined as showing symptoms . so , unless you can show that eating a raw food diet creates a deficiency , i would say your comment that raw food diets have a drawback is moot.more is not always better . sometimes it is simply just more.antioxidant markers are an indicator of how healthy one is , what i am saying is that raw foodists have very similar markers to those on a standard american diet , which is lacking in antioxidants . therefore one can conclude that a raw food diet doesn ’ t allow an adequate amount of nutrients to be absorbed despite the high intake of fruits and vegetables.you are making conclusions based on an extremely limited amount of information . you are making huge assumptions and not using sound scientific analysis . the level of assumption on your part is equivalent to saying “ hey , i know a guy who eats his boogers everyday and he is 100 years old , so if you eat your boogers , you will live to be 100 too ! ” there are thousands of anti-oxidants and you are basing a conclusion on two studies showing two anti-oxidants . raw food diets may provide much higher anti-oxidant levels of many of the thousands of other anti-oxidants , but there are no studies to show one way or the other , so again , your conclusion is based on opinion , not science.there is nothing that shows anti-oxidant levels are an indicator of health . have you considered the possibility that the raw food diet enables those anti-oxidants to react to free-radicals much quicker than a cooked food diet , and the reason the levels are lower is because they are being used at a quicker rate ? i am not saying that is what is happening , but just one of dozens of possible scenarios . this is why you have to look at studies objectively and actively seek reasons why certain results may be suspect or even completely void.you simply cannot make sound conclusions based on a few studies . you have to read hundreds or even thousands of studies on the matter . and studies focused on health markers provide significantly less valuable information than epidemiological studies . dr. t colin campbell conducted the largest epidemiological project in history and he concludes that the more raw foods you consume , the better.now , would you like to withdraw your statement that raw food diets have drawbacks ? or are you going to show me epidemiological evidence ? what i am saying is that a raw food diet is unnecessary for a healthful diet and requires a lot more eating to acquire sufficient nutrients and satisfy energy needs . that is the draw back i have been addressing.again , you have zero documentation that a raw food diet requires more eating to get the same nutrients than a cooked diet . you are focused on two studies that address two nutrients out of tens of thousands.energy needs or energy wants ? because we are living in the culture that consumes much more energy than it needs . reducing the calories available to someone in western cultures can only be considered beneficial . the less calories absorbed , the less diseases , the slower they age , and the longer they live.do you , do you not have any epidemiological evidence that eating a raw food diet has any drawbacks ? if not , then simply withdraw your statement.i don ’ t need a study to prove my simple point . lets look at calorie density . lets assume a 2,000 calorie diet consisting of fruits , vegetables and nuts ( since complex carbohydrates require cooking unless sprouted ) to achieve this you would need to eat about 6 bananas , 20 cups of chopped kale , and a cup cup of almonds ( which is around 70 grams of fat , 100 % of our daily value . ) and all these foods would fill u up quickly ( except the almonds ) but not keep u full very long at all.those ratios could be changed around however , it would still be quite an inefficient diet … especially with all that kale if u chose to gets your calories from this nutrient dense green.if we had cooked food on the other hand , we would need only 1 cup of dry rice , 2 cups of oats and 3 medium sweet potatoes ( excluding all other fruits and vegetables from the diet ) . this food not only keeps us full long , but it is nutritious and satisfies our energy needs.vegannutritionist , one question : i ’ m assuming you eat a raw vegan diet ( or “ high raw ” as you mentioned earlier ) … why ? why not cook many of the foods that you eat ? not sure what happened , but around 4 posts are gone , and the webpage to discussion board auto login stopped working.author : toxinscomment : “ i don ’ t need a study to prove my simple point . lets look at calorie density . lets assume a 2,000 calorie diet consisting of fruits , vegetables and nuts ( since complex carbohydrates require cooking unless sprouted ) to achieve this you would need to eat about 6 bananas , 20 cups of chopped kale , and a cup cup of almonds ( which is around 70 grams of fat , 100 % of our daily value . ) and all these foods would fill u up quickly ( except the almonds ) but not keep u full very long at all.those ratios could be changed around however , it would still be quite an inefficient diet … especially with all that kale if u chose to gets your calories from this nutrient dense green.if we had cooked food on the other hand , we would need only 1 cup of dry rice , 2 cups of oats and 3 medium sweet potatoes ( excluding all other fruits and vegetables from the diet ) . this food not only keeps us full long , but it is nutritious and satisfies our energy needs . ” my response : toxnis , you are really proving your ignorance on nutrition . first of all , the nutritional value of the raw food you mentioned is several orders of magnitude higher than the cooked food you recommended . kale being one of the highest in the world . in addition , the best formula we have that simplifies the path to health is health = nutrients / calories , so , the more nutrients and fewer calories , the healthier we become . you gave a list of cooked foods with rather low levels of nutrients and high calories . not the best foods for becoming healthy . and what happens when someone eats more calories ? the first thing is their metabolism speeds up . you probably think this is a good thing , but it is not . a fast metabolism promotes disease and increases aging . you are the first person to suggest that more calories are better . i am assuming it is because this is your last attempt to somehow promote the “ drawbacks ” of a raw food diet . you have made a lot of assumptions and expressed your opinion , but you haven ’ t provided any evidence . why not step up and simply withdraw your statement that a raw foods diet has drawbacks . have you ever eaten a raw foods diet for any considerable amount of time ? have you ever felt the energy and vitality they provide ? have you ever been to a raw foods festival and seen the bodies of raw food practitioners ? the best way to describe most of them is “ greek gods ” .if you are eating any whole-foods plant-based diet , i certainly wouldn ’ t tell you it has drawbacks . in fact , i would support you because it is very healthy for you , the environment , and the animals . what is your motivation to tel someone who eats healthy and compassionately that their diet has drawbacks ? dr greger even stated in one of the videos you linked that we should consume vegetables in whatever form that makes us want to consume the most . for me , that is raw.author : maybush1comment : vegannutritionist , one question : i ’ m assuming you eat a raw vegan diet ( or “ high raw ” as you mentioned earlier ) … why ? why not cook many of the foods that you eat ? maybush , i don ’ t like cooked food as much as i like raw . i do occasionally eat cooked food , but i like the way raw foods taste and the way they make me feel . why is it that you are attacking someone who more or less agrees with the way you eat ( we all agree that a vegan diet is the healthiest , regardless of how it ’ s prepared … those are minutia and details that shouldn ’ t invite such a strong attacking response ) . calling someone ignorant ( even indirectly ) certainly does not invite people to your side . the same accusations you are directing toward toxins ( claiming something without proof , of which toxins seems to have done one one point ) is something you seem to be doing quite well and in seemingly much more abundance : “ the nutritional value of the raw food you mentioned is several orders of magnitude higher than the cooked food you recommended ” ( “ several orders of magnitude ” ? by what reference ? ) , “ the best formula we have that simplifies the path to health is health = nutrients / calories ” ( seems too simplistic of an equation … what about other factors ? organics ? age ? cooking ? etc … have we looked at all of those thousands of antioxidants you mentioned are in many foods ? maybe many are deleterious in higher numbers of that equation – the numerator ) , “ a list of cooked foods with rather low levels of nutrients and high calories ” ( what nutrients ? you previously mentioned thousands in food . and by what reference ? ) , “ the first thing is their metabolism speeds up . [ after eating more calories ] ” , “ a fast metabolism promotes disease and increases aging . ” ( i believe aerobic exercise tends to increase metabolism … should we stop ? ) , ” the best way to describe most of them [ people at a raw foods festival ] is “ greek gods ” ” ( i ’ ve seen many and they seem sickly thin to me … but that ’ s admittedly just my * opinion * ) … and all of these unsupported claims were found in your last post * alone * ! my point is simply this : why argue so vehemently against someone who seems to be pretty much on your side of the health argument ? i think your energy and resources would be better and more efficiently utilized if directed toward those who really promote unhealthy diet / lifestyles.to your health ! now you are just using ad hominem and being quite hypocritical and not to mention rude . i am not trying to win anyone to “ my side ” i am just challenging your inaccurate and opinionated statement that a raw food diet has some kind of drawback versus cooked food . just admit that what your claim is baseless . look up phytonutrients . something over 10,000 of them . exercise decreases metabolism . this is why people train . the lower the resting metabolism and the higher the maximum output means the greatest available work output . “ i think your energy and resources would be better and more efficiently utilized if directed toward those who really promote unhealthy diet / lifestyles . ” you made the derogatory comment against my diet , remember ? someone proves you wrong , and then you can only attack them ? seriously , can ’ t you just man up and admit when you spoke out of ignorance ? that ’ s funny , but toxins and i are two completely different people ( i ’ m just observing from the sidelines as you continue to attack her / him ) . i think you ’ re confused as to whom is whom . btw , i used no ad hominems toward you in my last post ( if i did , please … point them out ! … and if so , i apologize ) . also , i completely agree that there are hundreds if not thousands of “ phytonutrients ” and antioxidants in foods . but you ignored my point with respect to them : if so , then how can you make a judgment call on their total efficacy ( have they all been researched ? ) , just as you have accused toxins of doing the same with respect to the claim that they were making ? one potential example , as you mentioned in an earlier post with respect to absorption of these nutrients , is the possibility that if taken in too large a number or dose they become hazardous . more , in other words , isn ’ t necessarily better . if this is what you are saying , then i applaud you ! as for resting metabolic rate ( rmr ) and exercise … i am afraid you are completely wrong . rmr increases ( not decreases ) with exercise . this is a very well-known result of exercise in the medical community . metabolic rates measure how much energy is being utilized in the body and that measurement goes up with training and exercise ( not down ) . for those who wish to lose weight , exercise provides them the best way to burn that excess energy store , thus an increase in their metabolic rate will benefit them . ( one quick example of research to support that claim from many that i can find : http : / / ukpmc.ac.uk / abstract / med / 3492457 / reload = 0 ; jsessionid = wfykc43g4pp4taiijvmw.6 ) to you health ! the whole point of the calorie for calorie example was to show energy expenditures and efficiency of the diet in regards to quantity consumed . if you need to eat more raw food to achieve what cooked food has to offer that in itself is a drawback.sure , that is a drawback . because people just hate eating food.i could make dozens more points against cooking , but i won ’ t . if people are eating healthily , consciously , and have no symptoms of deficiency , then i wouldn ’ t dream of trying to get them to change by telling them their diet is somehow inferior to my own . people love eating food , that ’ s not the problem . the problem is when it gets to the point where one must eat food all day to remain satiated and to satisfy energy needs and expenditures . its a constant state of digestion.you are grasping at straws . yesterday , i ate over 4,000 calories in four meals that probably took around 30-40 minutes of my time , and most of that was cutting up the food . when i cook food , i spend a lot more time cooking than when eating raw foods , so i actually have more free time . so , again , your point is baseless . can you simply admit that you have no evidence ? or are you going to keep grasping at straws because your ego is too big to ever admit you may be wrong ? you seem to be missing my point … i have tried to explain it to you in several different ways now but i see now that you simply cannot grasp what i am trying to tell you . ill leave it at that and let the readers of these comments decide what ’ s best.i agree . i thought you recently mentioned that “ the best formula we have that simplifies the path to health is health = nutrients / calories ” . 4000 calories in one day certainly sounds to me that the denominator in that equation will shoot the “ health ” result straight down ! now , accusing someone ’ s ego of being too big to admit a wrong that you want desperately from them certainly sounds like a great example of an ad hominem to me ! that ’ s an example of a character attack . to your health ! let me explain the formula to you in an easier to understand format . health = nutrients / calories means that the higher the nutrients , and the lower the calories , the healthier they tend to be . now you made the statement that 4000 calories would “ shoot the “ health ” result straight down . ” but again , you are formulating a conclusion based on insufficient data . you have no way of knowing how many nutrients i consumed . if the nutrients i consumed where 1,000 fold that of someone who ate only a 400 calorie hamburger all day , then the resulting health figure would be 100 times more than that of the person who ate only the hamburger . and i am sure i burned at least 4,000 calories yesterday . now , concerning ad hominem . in order for me to have committed ad hominem , i would have to be attacking his character in order to show his argument is false . i showed many times his argument was false and he repeatedly continue to fail to show any evidence to support his claims . therefore , the discussion was moot and at not time did i “ attack ” him to draw attention away from his position . his position was already compromised . however , you are committing ad hominem again by trying to focus on my character instead of the subject of the discussion . now , back to the discussion … oh , sure you are a different person.you are telling me i am attacking someone . that is ad hominem.i am just trying to get someone to show me evidence of the drawbacks of my diet , or admit they have none.concerning rmr . the abstract of the study to which you linked mentions nothing of energy intake . nor do dozens of other studies i have read mention energy intake . this is a flaw in the design of the study by not controlling other effects of metabolism . when people exercise , they usually eat more food . more calories than the amount of exercise would normally burn . so , their metabolism increases to try and burn the extra calories . here is a study that takes in account the energy balance of the individual. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19833807 “ these data suggest that when exercise is performed with energy replacement ( i.e. , energy balance is maintained ) , 24-h fat oxidation does not increase and in fact , may be slightly decreased . it appears that the state of energy balance is an underappreciated factor determining the impact of exercise on fat oxidation . ” lol , it ’ s completely up to you if you choose to believe that i am a different person than toxins . it ’ s actually quite comical to think that i am ! anyway , “ you are telling me i am attacking someone . that is ad hominem . ” uh , no . that is not an ad hominem . here ’ s the definition ( if you should choose to believe it ) from merriam-webster : 1 : appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect2 : marked by or being an attack on an opponent ’ s character rather than by an answer to the contentions madenot to nitpick ( but i feel that ’ s where we ’ ve gone ) , can you please explain to me how when i pointed out the fact that when you attacked someone i am using an ad hominem ? i am neither “ appealing to feelings or prejudices ” ( 1 ) by pointing that fact out … nor am i “ attacking you ” by saying so ( 2 ) . good luck on that one ! i , personally , have found little to no drawbacks to your raw diet … nor have i ever accused you of having any . in fact , i would like to know if there are any as well.rmr : it goes up with exercise ( which was my point , if you missed it ) … i said it does … you said it goes down … consistant research proves me correct no matter how much you wish to redefine their protocol.enjoy ! mr. maybusher . here is the definition you posted . ” marked by or being an attack on an opponent ’ s character rather than by an answer to the contentions made ” you attacked my character by claiming i attack others . i did not . no research proves that rmr goes up with exercise . the study you linked to does not factor in calorie consumption . show me a study that does factor in calorie consumption that shows rmr increases when energy intake equals energy expenditure . you need to be able too read the studies completely , understand the methods of data taking , understand the data derived , determine if the methods used to obtain the data support the conclusion , and use good raw data to establish your own conclusions . i don ’ t just read the abstract and use it as evidence to show what i am speaking about is correct , i read the whole study and look at it objectively . the study you linked to does not support your conclusion. what about creatine transportation in blood ? it needs both na and cl to be transported in the bloodstream , right ? .please also check out my associated blog post do eden beans have too much iodine ? can you find out more information about sodium alginate ? sodium alginate is made from brown algae and is used as a food stabilizer , thickener , gelling agent , or emulsifier in foods such as ice cream or gravy . it has been found to increase blood pressure in some people.the intersalt study in 1984 concluded for the world no association between sodium intake and blood pressure . dr michael alderman has done a lot of work concluding the less salt we eat , the higher prevalence of myocardial infarction there is due to an increase in plasma renin . salt is a mineral and it is good for us , too little can be harmful . i add good quality sea salt to everything i cook and eat and have done so for the past five years and my blood pressure is 100 / 50i have had very good blood pressure readings , usually 116-120 / 72-75 . but after starting a plant based diet , and working a stressful job , studying for a major test for work , and having just moved into a new house , i found my blood pressure 135-140 / 81-85 ! that concerns me ! i don ’ t know if it ’ s all the changes and work happening lately , but it can ’ t be the diet . someone help ! i have been thinking about reducing my sodium intake since i see stuff like this a lot but have developed hyponatremia . i dont do intense exercise where i sweat a lot , but my levels were almost severe that they ran the test twice . ive been a vegan a few years now . whats up with this ? i am really surprised.would you comment on today ’ s ( may 15 , 2013 ) iom / nas study that has been reported to state that reducing sodium intake below 2300mg may be harmful ? sounds bogus to me … mr.greger , what do you think , is it ok to cut all salt for several weeks , given that i don ’ t eat processed food , but the same time i eat only very little food ? is it any risk in my functioning ? thank you very much ! you should be fine from a salt stand point unless you have some unusual medical condition . i have not had any patients who have had their functioning compromised by eliminating salt from their diet . your kidneys are able to reduce the elimination of sodium to very low levels if needed . of course it depends on what you are trying to achieve . if you are on medications you should work with your physician if you don ’ t feel well with no added salt in your diet then i would work with your physician as well.hi doctor greger , so what is better no salt or low salt ? we constantly hear that we some salt is important but is it a myth of the industry ? i would describe myself as a heavy exerciser.i am a vegan and last year i had a heat stroke . because of high blood pressure , i avoided salt . i have seen several utube videos ( see links below ) teaching the benefits of salt , iodine and how lack of salt may cause “ heat stroke ” . very confusing . please clarify . thank you.http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = ilpageqqoiu salt & iodine enhance your health ( 1 / 4 ) http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = cho8yqt3co8 http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = _ 9 _ 0grpt _ okomg i had no idea . that is another reason why i should be a vegan specialty whit my high blood presurethere are major problems with drawing any conclusions regarding the study cited by dr. greger . besides the small population size of 29 individuals , the short 2 week duration of the study , and the fact that it looked at only overweight and obese individuals , most problematic was the fact that changes were made to the diets of both the low salt and high salt groups . was the high salt group consuming the same level of salt prior to study or did the new diet prescribed by the study represent an increase in salt consumption for the high salt group ? also , it would be far more useful to see the effects on vascular function of a low salt versus high salt diet over a period of at least 6 months to a year to see how vascular function adjusted to the new salt levels over an extended time period . in addition , dr. greger also implied that individuals with low blood pressure will also reduce their vascular function by consuming higher levels of salt . since the study looked at only individuals with normal bp such a conclusion is unwarranted.here is some supplementary data http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23263240 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 23141486although both studies are short term and the sample size is small , the data remains consistent with the finding.thanks for providing these additional studies . they do seem to support the possibility that reducing sodium intake has a positive effect on vascular function at least in the short run . my biggest concern is that these studies all involve short term interventions in sodium consumption and in very small population samples . it would be far more persuasive if long term measures of vascular function were compared between age adjusted populations , with basically equivalent average blood pressure readings and significantly different average daily consumption levels of sodium but where no intervention was involved.outside of vascular function , we know that consuming higher sodium may also cause an increase in calcium loss . figure 14 describes this relationship http : / / www.fao.org / docrep / 004 / y2809e / y2809e0h.htm # bm17i have not seen , or at least do not remember seeing long term studies on sodium and vascular function other then hypertension but i will look into this.i agree . the evidence against salt does not seem all that strong . more studies are needed.is the sodium hydroxide used in making pretzels toxic / dangerous / ” harmful ” ? what about those who exercise a lot ? do they require more salt considering they lose it through sweat ? why doesn ’ t chicken taste salt then ? high blood pressure doesn ’ t sound as scary as the results of quite a number of studies , e.g. : “ our study supports the view that high intake of sodium is an important dietary risk factor for gastric cancer , with a synergistic effect found between salt and h.pylori … ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 22938408my grandma recently moved in and she wants to put salt in everything i eat ! now she thinks i ’ m some crazy anti-salt person : / i ’ m told potassium and sodium work together in the body , when you eat a lot of bananas it appears to help your body rid itself of excess sodium , i wonder if we could factor that in ? do we know the health benefits of himalayan salt over regular table salt ? i know that all the minerals but sodium and chloride are removed from table salt . plus flow agents and iodine are added.check the amount of sodium per 1 / 4 teaspoon in the himalayan salt compared to table salt . i haven ’ t found one that is under 500mg . that is basically the same as table salt . there are sea salts that have less than 400 mg per 1 / 4 teaspoon and no fillers . seems to me they would be the better alternative.although they do not contain iodine . so that is one downfall to the alternative salts.salt is salt . you may receive more minerals , but you still get the sodium . hate to be the bearer of bad news : ( honestly i personally know people in the high carb low fat community who have ben hospitalized for hyponatremia , me included ! all because of the lack of sodium in our blood which is vital for basic human function and lacking this mineral leads to death . dr.greger are you absolutely sure that we all should avoid salt ? i mean this is a serious matter … it ’ s one thing to avoid animal products high in sodium and all processed food but for those of us who already follow a whole food plant based diet , specifically high in carbs and low in fat , are you sure that we should also avoid salt ? ? ? i ’ m no scientist so i trust your advice but i have to say that most of your audience here is already vegan and eating minimally processed food and that a little salt miht probably be just what “ the doctor ordered “ , in order to avoid the terrible experience that many of us have had . hyponatremia is serious and can lead to fast death . looking forward for your reply ! please do reply ? thank you so very much . joanaps- please take a look at this study if you get a chance : http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1113 / expphysiol.2007.039891 / fullhi jv , i think you bring up great points . i checked the research and did not find more risk of hyponatremia in vegans . perhaps anecdotally it is something to watch out for if following a vegan diet ? i ’ m not sure and i would not make that correlation . i responded about salt intake in another section , if interested . i ’ m also not sure what to make of the study you listed it talks about the need for sodium and it ’ s biochemical pathway , which we know the human body requires , but i ’ m not sure it suggests risk with low-sodium diets ? the sodium appetite was interesting ! thanks for sharing your concerns and questions.best , josephthank you for your response ! this is all so confusing though , i really wish an agreement on salt intake would be reached by the medical community ! dr. john mcdougall recommends a little sprinkled salt on food for people with no heart disease . so does dr. george guthrie ( see this short video – https : / / youtu.be / rvk5fltpqki ) . when i was hospitalized they told me that the major problem is drinking too much water ( i had drunk about 8liters the day i was hospitalized ! because my sodium levels were already low , my body was asking for minerals which made me more thirsty and by drinking water the situation was only getting worse ! i had to be on intravenous saline for 3days to recover to normal levels . i know a guy who went through the same , and even had damage to his brain because of this situation , it really is quite dangerous ! i was advised to start adding a little salt to the food , especially because i don ’ t eat processed food , and to limit water intake ( actually after sodium levels were regular i stopped being so thirsty , i probably don ’ t even drink half of what i used to ) .so here ’ s the thing , when you say stop all salt , i feel fear that this might happen again . i also am aware that too much of it must be bad.but how much is too much ? and is it really safe to have absolutely none at all ? i honestly would love to have a conclusive response on this , or at least a satisfying one … as of now it all seems very confusing and unclear , in terms of what doctors are advising.it seemed from your response that you too aren ’ t sure what to advise anymore , is that correct ? i hope more studies and / or conclusions are reached so we can follow a path that is likely to be more successful.thanks again joseph ! cheers ! jv.less than 1500mg of sodium per day . i don ’ t think we ever said you need zero salt , as it is needed ! it ’ s found naturally in foods in low amounts . drinking that much water can cause problems , as you mentioned and unfortunately experienced . another member posted a similar story , my comments about drinking too much water and sweating on hot summer days ​ . again , the american heart association advised < 1500mg / dayand check out dr. forrester ’ s comments below . thanks , jv ! thank you so much for responding on this subject joseph ! just to clarify , if one eats a whole foods plant based diet with plenty of greens ( over a pound daily ) , lots of starches , along with other vegetables and a few fruits , and on top of that adds nutritional yeast , seaweed and flaxseed to meals ( and herbs and spices ) , would that satisfy 1500mg of sodium from diet or is adding salt required to reach that value ? in other words , what is 1500mg / day in terms of plant foods in their whole form ? thanks again , honestly you ’ ve no idea how much it means to me that you ’ re helping clarify this subject ! sincerely , jvthat would probably cut it ( being < 1500mg ) especially with the sea veggies added i think they tend to have more so that 's fine . you d have to calculate to know for sure.no problem you are very welcome : - ) thank you joseph ! : ) ) ) bacon , beef , blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , chicken , consumers union , food additives , french fries , heart disease , heart health , hypertension , mcdonald ’ s , poultry , pretzels , processed meat , red meat , salt , sodium , white meat if your blood pressure is normal is there any reason to avoid sodium ?

PLAIN-3351	update on spirulina what about the microscopic greens , blue-green algae ? of all the controversial findings i ’ ve shared from the medical literature over the years , the one i get the most mail about . people love their pond scum . so i ’ ve stayed on top of the literature and it ’ s time for an update . there ’ s no doubt that spirulina does some amazing things , but as with everything in life it ’ s all about risk / benefit , and so although in 2007 the data pointed against spirulina and i threw mine out and encouraged others to do the same , is it possible that the balance of evidence has shifted back in favor ? still harmful , half and half , or crept back to helpful ? in 2007 i was concerned about spirulina causing muscle breakdown , and these new findings have me concerned about liver cancer too . 94 % of samples were found to be contaminated with hepatotoxic microcystin toxins . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other “ hhh ” videos ( harmful , harmless , or helpful ? ) . also , there are over a thousand subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! i just read an article by dr. mercola praising the benefits of spirulina and noting it was voted the number 1 superfood by aarp . i am wondering if you have learned anything else about spirulina that changes your mind about whether it is harmful , helpful or harmless.is the spirulina in this study only from china ? i wonder if organic spirulina harvested in the usa would have the same findings … … tduke , we are not looking at the contaminants found in spirulina , like we would in fish products or rice products , but the physical byproducts produced by spirulina itself . with this in mind it should ’ nt matter whether or not it was shipped from china or usa.thank you ! seems like i should throw mine out too ! hey toxins , i was wondering where i could find this information about the physical byproducts produced by spirulina . i ’ ve looked through all the sources cited by dr. gregor in a few videos but haven ’ t seen anything on the physical byproducts spirulina itself.there were the two studies : ( detection of the hepatotoxic microcystins in 36 kinds of cyanobacteria spirulina food products in china ) , and ( first detection of anatoxin-a in human and animal dietary supplements containing cyanobacteria . ) which both sort of conclude that quality control of cyanobacterial food supplements is required to avoid potential health effects in humans and animals but didn ’ t seem to deal with byproducts of digestion . perhaps i missed something.if you could help clarify this for me that would be awesome

march of this year , another video was posted , this one on it ’ s potential to cause neurotoxicity : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / update-on-spirulina-2 / , but fortunately , “ … kale is

the spirulina division on face book … they responded to me … spirulina division hello , christopher . the point you raise is the prime reason why it is extremely important to harvest spirulina at a ph over 10 ( between 10-11 ) . this is part of the quality control that commercial producers and small-scale producers employ to ensure spirulina ’ s quality for consumers . if it ’ s not at the right ph , it simply doesn ’ t get harvested . the liver toxins you ’ re speaking of are called microcystins , which are peptides produced microcystis , not by spirulina . microcystis are unable to survive at such a high alkaline level between 10-11 . this is what separates spirulina from another superfood cyanobacteria , aphanizomenon flos-aquae ( aka afa blue-green algae ) , which commonly grows up in klammath lake in oregon . afa , however , cannot grow at the high alkaline levels that spirulina can in order to avoid microcystins . this is the prime reason why i grow spirulina and not afa , or chlorella for that matter , which also grows at a lower ph . commonly , people and researchers assume that since afa and spirulina are both cyanobacteria , their ideal growing conditions are also one and the same , but they usually get lumped together anyway when the research is not complete . it would be helpful if the gentleman who produced the video would learn more about each species and their

PLAIN-3361	update on chocolate this year a report on a major international scientific conference on chocolate , finally revealed why we human beings crave chocolate so much . their scientific , technical finding ? “ we conclude that we like chocolate because it tastes so nice . ” medically , last year a randomized controlled crossover study from yale examining , “ acute dark chocolate ingestion . ” and people got paid for that too . they found that the sugar in chocolate isn ’ t any good for you , the fat in chocolate — the cocoa butter — isn ’ t any good for you , but the actual cacow bean solids , which is sold as cocoa powder , is wonderful stuff , leading the journal of the american heart association this year to conclude that the cocoa itself can be recommended without hesitation . ah , but which is healthier , cocoa or the dutch processed cocoa ? some of you may need to go back to the basics . we have cocoa , and we have processed cocoa . and when you process food you lose nutrients . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the sequel , is carob good for you ? . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! do you use raw cocoa or the dutch ? is your cocoa heated or processed ? i am very confused as to what form of chocolate is praised in this and other videos . is it the ground up powder from raw chocolate beans , still completely raw , that you add to your vegan ice-cream ? thank you.i have a teaspoon of cocoa powder in my coffee every morning . satisfies my chocolate craving and tastes fabulous : > i remember hearing about a canadian study on cocoa consumption and reduction in skin cancer-i think it ’ s ongoing.there was a study done in 2008 stating woman who ate more chocolate had lower bone density . do you have anymore information on this potential problem with chocolatewhen adding cocoa to hot water , i notice it gets in my teeth . what problems might that cause , until you get to brush ? thank you.hi dr. greger , every morning i wake up with the craving to eat about 1-2 ounces of plain pecans topped with bits of dates i cut up with a few pieces of crushed cocoa beans that i stick in the dates on top of the pecans . i really like to eat this in the morning for antioxidents and the boost of energy but since i end up eating about 2 tablespoons of it every morning i clock in about 9.3 grams of saturated fat . do the cholesterol combating components of cocoa neutralize the effects of its fats or does it pose health problems and possible weight gain ? thank you for all of your work ! you are the best ! erin t : ) wow , this m.d never answered any of the questions even though he ’ s had like 3 years in a couple cases.guess i ’ m not really going to be taking this as a trusted source or all too reputable.sorry about that . i am sure he would have liked to but this site has gotten very busy over the past years , which is why i am now consulting with dr. greger and trying to answer everyone ’ s questions . if any arise please let us know and i ’ ll do my best to help . american heart association , chocolate , cocoa , cocoa butter , dark chocolate , dutched cocoa , fat , junk food , processed foods , ranking foods , saturated fat , sugar , yale results of a major international scientific conference summarized for some of the most recent videos on cacao : dark chocolate and artery function a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome fat burning via flavonoids
PLAIN-3371	a harmless artificial sweetener so this is where the more artificial sweeteners come in . harmful , harmless , or helpful ? 6-methyl-1,2,3-oxathiazine-4 ( 3h ) -one , 2,2-dioxide , also known as acesulfame k , sold as sweet one . aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester , also known as aspartame or nutrasweet . cyclohexanesulfamic acid , known as cyclamate , sold as sugar twin . ( 2r , 3s ) -butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol , or erythritol , sold as z-sweet . benzoic sulfinide — saccharin — discovered by accident while experimenting with coal tar derivatives and sold as sweet and low . steviol glycosides , extracted from the stevia plant and now sold as truvia by the coca cola company , and purevia by the pepsicola company . chlorinated hydrocarbon sucralose , discovered by accident at queen ’ s college in london while trying to formulate a new pesticide , sold as splenda . and finally hexahydroxyhexane , or sorbitol . whew ! now last year we learned aspartame may be harmful — in fact recently also linked to hypertension — but what about these others ? i ’ ll give you two hints . first , none of them are helpful . why ? because none of them have any nutrition — no calories , but no nutrition . and your second hint is that not all of them are harmful . based on the best available science at least one or more is harmless . so what do you think ? acesulfame — harmful or harmless ? harmful — linked to dna damage last year.what about sugar twin ? harmful or harmless ? you may not remember sugar twin , because the evil twin was banned 39 years ago . still legal in canada though ! what about z-sweet ? harmful or harmless ? harmless . found naturally in pears , melons , and grapes , absorbed in the intestine so it doesn ’ t have a laxative effect , and it ’ s excreted virtually unchanged in the urine.what about saccharin ? causes bladder cancer in male rats , but not female rats . what about people ? harmful or harmless ? saccharin may cause bladder cancer in people too.what about stevia ? huge amount of new research on stevia , but … the jury ’ s still out . check back next year.there is a verdict on sucralose , though . what do you think ? harmful or harmless ? harmful , based primarily on the role it may play as a migraine trigger.and finally , the sugar alcohols sorbitol and xylitol . harmful or harmless ? unlike erythritol , these other sugar alcohols are not absorbed and so they draw fluid into your colon and can have a laxative effect . i appreciate that this kind of video has to be short and can only cover so many topics . however , i have a nit to pick on the topic of xylitol.the gist of the video seems to be that since xylitol can have a laxative effect , it falls into the harmful category . well , prunes can have a laxative effect if you eat too much of them . surely you wouldn ’ t put prunes in the harmful category ? i believe that there is a safe level of xylitol under which there is not a laxative effect . i believe that not only because of all the websites which claim this to be true , but because i suck on xylitol mints and chew xylitol gum all day long and am not aware of any harmful effects.the reason i am nit picking on this is that it is my understanding that xylitol can have some very positive health effects : ( i ’ m probably getting the details wrong here , but the gist is : ) the bacteria or whatever that cause cavities can not east xylitol and having it in your mouth can help prevent cavities.one website even said that finland ? gives out xylitol gum to kids to help prevent cavities . and other websites talk about the ability of xylitol to help control or prevent ear infections in kids.is all that bs ? or could xylitol be beneficial when taken in safe amounts ? since stevia recently seemed to be getting a nod from you as ‘ safe under a certain amount ’ and yet stevia can actually be turned into mutagenic ( sp ? ) compounds ! , surely a substance that might have some mere laxative effects and yet also has some positive effects might also be deemed as safe under a certain amount ? what are your thoughts ? i ’ m also very curious about the statement that sorbitol and xylitol are the same . everything i ’ ve read said that they are both _ something ( sugar ? ) _ alcohols , but that they were slightly different . thoughts on this ? thanks for any clarifications you care to provide . i really do appreciate the information and do not mean to be too critical . i ’ m very interested if you know something i do not about xylitol not really helping teeth or ears . thanks.not nit-picking at all jj – thank you so much for question . you ’ re right : the mantra of the field of toxicology is that it ’ s the dose that makes the poison , and so in small amounts ( like gum and little candies ) the industry can get away with using sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and xylitol ( different , but have same effect , as they are not absorbed into the blood stream and so draw water in the bowel ) . but it ’ s not a realistic sweetener for things like sweetened beverages , which would have levelss that would have people running to the bathroom . bottomline : sorbitol and xylitol are safe in small amounts , but i recommend erythritol instead , since it is in the same class of compounds , but does not have that unpleasant effect even when taken in even relatively large doses . more on sweeteners here.thanks for the clarification . that helps . and since i drink flavored green teas ( another question coming to you on another video ) , i should be ok sucking on my xylitol “ mints ” and chewing my xylitol gum.i ’ m going to look into seeing if i can get mints and gum made out of erythritol , but i wonder if erythritol has the same protection against cavities as xylitol . while cavities can be fought other ways , i appear to need all the help on fighting cavities as i can get . if sucking on some xylitol mints does the trick but erythritol does not , i ’ ll probably stick with the xylitol . ( on the other hand , if reports of xylitol ’ s effect on cavity prevention has been exaggerated , then i will definitely re-think which gum i chew . ) thanks again for taking time to reply . it ’ s going to get tougher the more popular this site gets . : - ) helping so many people that i don ’ t have time to help people more is not the worst problem to have , but i will keep it up as much as i possibly can . erithritol does seem to help prevent cavities as well , but the latest review found that the evidence supporting the use of sugar alcohol for caries ( cavity ) prevention is not strong.dr. black at cedar sinai keeps away from all artifical sweeteners.it never had that effect on my and consumed 3 tablespoons or more per day . it xylitol might help rebuild bone . what a bonus to throw out ? during my dietetic internship i completed a rotation in oral health . xylitol , while efficient in fighting cavities , is often only found in trace amounts in many brand name gum and mints . the marketing can be confusing and requires buyers to do their research . while there are mints and gum with the necessary amount of xylitol available , they are often found at specialty stores or through a dentist ’ s office . spry and xylit are too well known brands . so while they are appropriate for fighting cavities , as a sweetener it would most likely result in an uncomfortable situation . there is some great information about a number of sweeteners in this video . i would check it out. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / a-harmless-artificial-sweetener / i have consumed sweet leaf stevia for years before i decided to simply drink beverages and eat foods that did not need to be artificially sweetened . therefore , i eliminated the need to such sweeteners.since i ’ ve been eating vegan , i ’ ve reduced my consumption of grains to eating them only to balance my amino acids , and have reduced or eliminated cavities and gum disease by simply brushing correctly and flossing.i used to have terrible tarter buildup at the gum line of my teeth . here is what has made such a difference for me : i mix xylitol with cinnamon and clove powder and use to brush my teeth . it tastes so good , that i love to brush . i never have bad breath and most importantly , my dental hygienist , always reports on how little tarter buildup there is to remove.there are expensive toothpastes with xylitol but i prefer the jar with cinnamon and clove i mix myself . i once read that xylitol was natural in strawberries and that in the middle ages strawberries were considered the fruit of lovers since strawberries kept the mouth clean and breath sweet.in what quantities do you mix your toothpaste ? does the type of cinnamon matter ? xylitol rebuilds bone ( in rats ) at a concentration which is biologically absorbable at 5 % of calories consumed with a diet of a 0.05 % daidzein from soy . xylitol has a nice pleasant taste . it is worth investigating especially for post menopausal women . it is most interesting that the authorizes of the research propose that xylitol gut flora . apparently for the better . human gut flora is notoriously hard to alter compared with rats . so this needs to be tested in humans. http : / / www.jourlib.org / paper / 3091505 # .vil4c2dovphi wouldn ’ t classify “ a laxative side effect ” and “ bladder cancer ” in the same category i.e. harmful . bladder cancer is harmful , laxative effect is a nuisance . i understand there ’ s no in-between category , but if there was one i would keep “ laxative effect ” in a “ not harmful but there are side effects ” category ! i use citrucel sugar free , which has aspartame . how much of a disservice am i doing to myself by not using the sugar one ? or are both evil , and i need to find a different , unsweetened product ? ( obviously any laxative effect is not a bad thing . ) thanks ! aspartame is a carcinogen and is quite harmful . you would be much better off using plain sugar over aspartame. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-nutrasweet % c2 % ae-bad-for-you / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / update-on-aspartame / plain sugar ( mostly comes from sugar beets ) and is 95 % genetically engineered with a foreign organism from a different species to be resistant to the herbicide , roundup . big money is in the way of testing roundup for its ability to cause cancer in humans , but it ’ s been linked to cancers such as non-hodgkin ’ s lyphoma.anyone know the temperature that erythritol dissolves at ? i ’ ve read that the cooling sensation disappears when erythritol is dissolved ( and that it dissolves at a high temperature ) , but i can ’ t seem to find the specific temperature.does erythritol stimulate appetite ? i have “ heard ” that sweets ( fruit , cookies , candies , gum , etc ) stimulate appetite.i have not heard of any appetite-stimulating properties of erythritol . i have , however , heard of some of the artificial sweeteners being capable of this , and definitely high fructose corn syrup ( contains an abnormally high amount of the monosaccharide , fructose ) . on the other hand , any of the sugar alcohols can cause flatulence and have a laxatrive effect , in larger quantities . erythritol is less likely than other sugar alcohols to have this effect , and everyone ’ s threshold is different.all those things increase my appetite , sadly … i thank you for just being alive and contributing all of the wonderful wisdom you share with us daily ! cant thank you enough dr. greger ! ! what is your take on the following substances ? gymnema sylvestre ( gurmar ) eugenia jambolana ( jamun ) ( this is a purple coloured fruit found extensively in india and something i often picked up and ate as kid as it fell of a tree . was told it is highly prized as a curative fruit for diabetes.momordica charantia ( karela bitter melon ) . this is something my father ate every other day as a curative fruit for diabetes . i never liked the taste , but once my mother got it suitably spiced up and with some sweetener , ( i would use only zsweet now since seeing your video on artificial sweeteners being lousy food substitutes ) trigonella foenum graeceun ( fenugreek ) commonly used in india curry recpies … … and for many remedies … including spicing up a man ’ s sex life.lastly , dr. gerger what do you think of citruline and l argenine in their role as helping out in repairing the endothelium cells ( citruline ) and the later helping in promoting nitrous oxide formation if one used the drug versions instead of citruline absorbed thru watermelon rind where a large portion of citulline is usually discarded ? thank you again for all the wisdom you expound here … thanks and namaste … .. dataso glad you find my work useful ! i ’ ll have to look into gurmar and jamun ; as for citrulline and watermelon , i cover that in my video watermelon as treatment for erectile dysfunction , which is chapter 33 of my latest in clinical nutrition dvd , volume 8 , and should air here at nutritionfacts.org by the end of the month . i ’ ve also got upcoming videos on fenugreek , so i leave you in suspense ( * spoiler alert * : fenugreek seeds appear to have both muscle-building and anti-cancer properties , but do have an unusual side effect : they may make your armpits smell like maple syrup ! ) .i ’ ve often wondered about bitter melon myself ( momordica charantia , also known as karela , or bitter gourd ) . i ’ m glad you brought it up to give me an excuse to look into it . i ’ ve seen it at the indian spice stores i frequent ( looks kind of like a ridged warty cucumber ) , but never tried it . i hear it lives up to its name , though . in fact the more ripe it gets , the more inedibly bitter it evidently becomes ! but with enough heavy spicing i guess anything can be made palatable ( the best way to mask the taste appears to be tomato-based sauces ) .a study published just a few days ago found that an extract of the fruit appeared to slow the growth of a rare cancer in a petri dish ( adrenocortical carcinoma , an aggressive 1 in a million cancer of the adrenal gland ) , something that extracts of blueberries , zucchini , and acorn squash couldn ’ t do . similar findings were reported in 2011 with prostate cancer cells and in 2010 with breast cancer cells . traditionally , bitter melon has been used to lower blood sugars in diabetics , though most of the studies to support this use have been small and methodologically weak . there was a randomized controlled study published in 2007 that found no significant improvement in long-term blood sugar control in diabetics , but there have also been case reports of children having hypoglycemic seizures ( and one even sinking into a coma ) after drinking bitter melon tea , so presumably there is some blood-sugar-lowering effect there somewhere . if you are going to try it , i would recommend eating the fruit itself , not some extract . for example , there is a published report of a man who started throwing up blood after chugging two cups of bitter melon juice , which apparently ate through the wall of his stomach.dear dr. greger , given that zsweet is a combination of erythritol and stevia , shouldn ’ t we be eating pure erythritol instead , until we get definitive results for stevia ? thanks so much for your wonderful website.for some context , please check out my associated blog post the best foods : test your nutrition knowledge ! have you seen any studies or information about coconut sap ? i have used it in baking ( i didn ’ t know about erythritol until now ) successfully ( as opposed to stevia – ick ) . the only info i find online is positive from the philippines , the location of its manufacture . it is reported to be low glycemic . i use coconut secret , whose label has the non-gmo verfied stamp . also claims 100 % organic , gf , unbleached , unrefined , and vegan . i have not been able to find any studies on coconut sap . i would employ the “ precautionary principle ” and avoid any food or substance that hasn ’ t been studied especially since there are options available which have been studied as dr. greger ’ s videos point out . the high low glycemic incidence scale needs to be viewed with caution . fructose for instance doesn ’ t increase the glucose in body but is metabolized by the liver to uric acid , cholesterol , fatty acids and inflammatory compounds . consumption should be confined to natural sources such as fruits and vegetables . be well.my daughter recommends erythitrol found in zsweet , but i have always used kal brand stevia with luo han . according to life extension magazine the properties of stevia actually are good for the pancreas . i do not get inflammation in my joints as i do in sugar alcohols . i have never tried erythitrol so i don ’ t know how that may effect them . if it is acidic , it will make my arthritis flare up . stevia does not do that . i have never heard that health care was up in the air about stevia . never.i don ’ t see much risk from sucralose . the only reports i see on pubmed that connect sucralose with migraine are case reports , not real studies . maybe people who suffer from migraine have reason to avoid sucralose but i don ’ t get migraine . in my mind that ’ s roughly in the same category as the fact that some people have food allergies . doesn ’ t mean i have reason to abstain . sucralose was created to be a pesticide . when told to test it , the tester misunderstood and tasted sucralose and found it to be sweet . hence , his company made it into an artificial sweetener.rinths laby , the only side effect i knew l had from aspartame was vision problems . i could not see with or without my bifocals . my preventive ophthalmologist retested my eyes and found nothing wrong . i wondered if it could be aspartame . and at the time , i was on a multiple chemicals sensitivity discussion list and so was a tenacious nurse who started researching the health damaging effects of equal / aspartame . one of many side effects was vision problems.taking the precautionary approach , i discarded all aspartame and never purchased it again , or any synthetic sweetener , and my vision improved to the point that i did not even need eye glasses for several decades.headaches or vision problems may mean that the chemical compound may be damaging the brain . a brain is a terrible thing to lose ! great info dr. greger , thank you ! the best tasting sweetener my family ever used is lakanto . made from erythriol and monk fruit . it has been sold in japan for 15 years ! now it ’ s finally available for us in us ! what ’ s wrong with cane sugar in moderation ? harmless or harmfullcane sugar is grown with the herbicide that regulators have found whenever they are searching for something else and it ’ s in the tapped water of most americans and people worldwide . the name of the chemical is : atrazine and it has been banned in europe . “ atrazine , which is produced by the swiss agrochemical company syngenta , was first registered for use in the united states in 1959 . the herbicide has been banned in the european union since 2004 — individual countries in europe banned atrazine as early as 1991 — but 80 million pounds … is used each year in the united states . ” http : / / environment.about.com / od / healthenvironment / a / how-dangerous-is-atrazine.htmsyngenta is one of the corporations who helped fund the no right to know about gmo ’ s in food campaign in california against the passage of citizens ballot initiative , proposition 37 , which lost by a very narrow margin , but would have given california citizens mandatory labeling and the right to know about gmo ’ s in food . where california goes , so goes the country . the right to know is temporarily dead , as more and more citizens across the usa are putting the matter on the ballot repeatedly . i urge you to become involved.cane sugar in small amounts should be fine . sucrose is half glucose ( our bodies primary fuel source and fructose metabolized by the liver into uric acid see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / flesh-and-fructose / , cholesterol , triglycerides and fats … so we should use the latter with some caution . there are no phytochemicals in sucrose and if you go a bit without using sweeteners in beverages most of my patients are able to develop a taste for non-sweetened beverages.what could possibly be wrong with stevia ? , they use it to healtruvia is not just stevia , bewaretruvia is gmowhat about dry organic stevia leaves ; either made at home or frontier organic ’ s coop product ? are there any studies of material available ? thank you-stevealthough truvia does contain stevia , the number one ingredient is erythritol ! i almost didn ’ t buy it … luckily i had a smartphone , googled erythritol , and decided it sounded good . since they don ’ t sell that z stuff at my local grocery store , i guess i will take my chances with the stevia . after all , don ’ t some people take it as a supplement ? also , it could be like the pomegranate juice and not actually contain stevia anyway : ) by the way … i really like this website . it ’ s addictive.i was wondering what would be a good sweetener to use for making tea . i have been using walmart version of splenda . i have recently been reading online that this could be the culprit of pain and inflammation and believe i am suffering from it . i have osteoarthritis and just recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia if it is the artificial sweetener causing these problems then i am gonna stop . problem is i am over weight so i know sugar is not good either . so what would be a better alternative for tea and coffee ? i can ’ t stand the taste of them or any thing else unsweetened . please help with any information.i love carbonated water ; give that a try . when i was on the south beach diet and they suggested using splenda i got so sick feeling from it – just felt awful and my eyes were very light sensitive . i finally figured out what was causing it and haven ’ t used artificial sweeteners since.any thoughts on “ swerve ” ? dear dr. greger , thanks for all the great work and videos . i have a question about sweeteners . where would maltitol fall in this category ? i came across this and other videos while searching for sugar alcohols . do you think you ’ ll be doing anything on them soon ? thanks ! hi .. i am new to your site and have found it very helpful. recently i have been trying to make better health choices and have watched a few health shows that have really opened my eyes to what could be harmful to my body . currently i use sugar twin but would like to try something else . i like truvia and believe it is a more natural sugar . you didn ’ t mention it in your video “ a harmless artificial sweetener ” unless i missed it ? i believe that some of the side effects i am experiencing is from using sugar twin ! any advise would be great … .i find that i am now ready every label b4 i put the food in my mouth .. thx ! i will continue to use your site … .. hi kunga ! welcome to the site , and kudos for trying to make better health choices ! i don ’ t know anything about sugar twin , but dr. greger has a few videos on alternative sweeteners . truvia is made from stevia , so you might watch is stevia good for you ? ( http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-stevia-good-for-you / ) . his blog post “ is there a safe , low-calorie sweetener ? ” http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 05 / 07 / is-there-a-safe-low-calorie-sweetener / discusses a few other options , with erythritol seeming most notable . he talks about erythritol ’ s potential antioxidant power here : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant / . hope that helps ! : ) except in rare cases , why would anyone avoid sugar ? oh , god ! i just bought 1500 packets of splenda at costco.don ’ t worry about it . go eat your ton of sucralose . this video doesn ’ t back up supposed sucralose dangers with any legitimate scientific data . i came here hoping to be enlightened about sucralose and all i get is “ it may trigger migraines ” . the verdict ( based on that one claim ) : harmful . this video seems like it was made for people with little to no scientific background who automatically think anything made in a lab is the devil ’ s work . depressing.the first thing this doctor does is poison the well with the fact that sucralose was accidentally discovered in a lab while trying to make an insecticide . and your point is ? ? ? cornell ? seriously ? this doctor must be a brilliant man to have gone there ( seriously , i am not being sarcastic ) . why would he make something so silly ? danger ! danger ! red light ! red light ! geez , my husband gets migraines from mangoes . conclusion : mangoes are harmful ! sucralose is safe. http : / / www.snopes.com / medical / toxins / splenda.asp take note that many of the studies that found sucralose to be toxic where done by ( surprise , surprise ) the sugar industry ! i ’ d be interested to hear your response to this dr gregor . i have greatly valued your contribution that helps clarify the mass of confusion that exists about nutrition … i was disappointed when i discovered the magnesium supplement that i purchased from a naturopath had sucralose in it . what is your response to the link posted by jentle72 supporting her / his claim that “ sucralose is safe . ” i am inclined to avoid it , which isn ’ t so hard for someone committed to a wholefood plant based diet anyway … but i was after some sound research to share with my naturopath in case she says something to the effect that “ there is nothing wrong with it and is no problem in the amount found in the supplement . ” i found this article which looks supportive , but not a research paper as such : http : / / www.medicalnewstoday.com / articles / 262475.phpi appears this video on “ safe ” artifical sweeteners is a few years old … so it may be time to take another look at this topic . i was excited that finally find that there was an artifical sweetener that was shown to be safe and have been using erythritol since seeing this video . however , i just ran across a story on erythritol that would be worth investigating a bit more . here is the link : http : / / www.naturalnews.com / 045450 _ truvia _ erythritol _ natural _ pesticide.htmlthe gist of the story is that erythritol has shown to be an effective pesticide for fruit flies … which now possibly puts into question the health impact on humans.i would interested in your thoughts on this.please see here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / erythritol-may-be-a-sweet-antioxidant / ok toxins , definitely appeciate the reply to daver , but the link you have is to a video that ’ s at least 2 years old . i agree with daver , it would definitely be nice to have another more recent look at the topic.i read the article daver linked to and it talked about the erythritol used being a gmo product from truvia and it being interesting if the non-gmo product didn ’ t produce the same effect . it was a good little article in my opinion.2 years old does not mean irrelevant , the foundation of good nutrition rests upon studies that are decades old . i am all for more studies on erythritol but for the time being its effects in humans are positive as studies have shown . in addition , gmo bears little weight on whether a food is healthy or not.hello. any research on eating just pure , natural stevia leaf that i buy in bulk at my health food store ? i put a tsp of the leaf in my smoothie every morning . thanks.xylitol , perhaps with laxative effect , … is that the only bad effect it has on people ? if one is constipated , could xylitol not be beneficial for some people ? i am thinking to keep xylitol and erythritol always on hand , and to finish the use of stevia since your recent research shows some effect of steviosides not being healthy after certain amounts . i have used stevia in liquid form since 1997 and have been fond of it in liquid form , ordering it from swanson vitamins in the 8oz size.it is true , dr greger , that americans have a “ sweet tooth ” and i am among those , since i was a child . i have tried , but cannot banish it from my tongue . while eating mostly vegetarian fresh veggies , occasionally i love and recommend sweet things , and use only organic healthy sweets such as fresh fruits , manuka honey and maple syrup , and until now , stevia . it is why i use coconut sugar in my organic , fiber packed , gourmet , double chocolate brownies , using four fibers ( flax , wheat bran , almond flour , buckwheat flour ) and grass fed butter and eggs . i have now read your research on date sugar being at the top of the healthy list , and will attempt to make the brownies with that . i am not sure that erythritol will do well in the brownies , since the science of baking has much to do with the reaction of traditional granulated sugars to oven heat . such is the experimentation of the test kitchen . thank you for everything you do.i find this a bit ironic . johnson & johnson just hired gs to ‘ explore the sale ’ of their sweetener splenda , determined to have no nutritional value and considered ‘ harmful based primarily on the role it may play as a migraine trigger ’ http : / / www.cnbc.com / id / 102233481 # . hasn ’ t goldman sachs given us enough migraines already ? dr. greger , i was so excited about the cranberry drink you suggested with erythritol . but when i told my dietician about it , she recommended that i return the erythritol back to the store right away . she said it used to be in many products but it has been removed because we cannot digest erythritol and it can cause diarrhea . if it was a great replacement , it would be in more products she says . what do you think ? usually not a problem as almost all of it is absorbed in small intestine with only small amount about 10 % reaching colon . most folks don ’ t notice a problem . as with many things it is related to dose and individual variability . high doses can lead to diarrhea , nausea , gas and bloating . the fact that it is not included in most products doesn ’ t mean it isn ’ t useful . erythritol has less diarrhea effect than other sugar alcohols but is not as sweet . a bonus is that it doesn ’ t appear to contribute to tooth decay as does sugar . what many of my patients find is that after time they can get use to less sweetness in their beverages . the nice thing about having the erythritol at home is that you can control the amount you use and see if you tolerate it . next time you see your dietician you might suggest that s / he subscribe to nutritionfacts.org the best way to keep up with the latest science and it ’ s free … . except for the time invested . you might be interested in the other 7 nutritionfacts video ’ s related to erythritol … . go thru health topics link . bon appétit ! please update your facts. my textbook says acesulfame-k , aspartame , and other sweeteners are already safe for consumption . thanks for this vid though ! acesulfame k , artificial sweeteners , aspartame , bladder cancer , bladder health , canada , colon disease , colon health , constipation , cyclamate , dna damage , erythritol , laxatives , migraine headaches , nutrasweet , pesticides , purevia , saccharin , sorbitol , splenda , stevia , sucralose , sugar twin , sweet and low , sweet one , sweeteners , truvia , xylitol , z-sweet most of the artificial sweeteners on the market have been associated with health problems . for some of the most recent videos on artificial sweeteners : neurobiology of artificial sweeteners unsweetening the diet how diet soda could make us gain weight
PLAIN-3381	are artificial colors harmful ? is it true that there ’ s a food dye made out of crushed bugs ? fact or fiction ? fact ! in fact , here it is , the pregnant koch-in-eel beetle . this is what it looks like when you smoosh them , and this is what it looks like when you lick them . and it doesn 't say “ contains bugs ” on the label , it says things like " color added " . so when parents feed their children yoplait yogurt , they are feeding them a " strawberry splash " of boiled insects . unappetizing ? perhaps , but harmful ? bug juice is after all a “ natural ” color — i mean , there ’ s nothing artificial about bugs . in fact the reason they use them is because some of the artificial red dyes , like red # 3 were banned as carcinogens . but who still thinks they ’ re still harmful ? who thinks gross , but harmless ? anyone think they could maybe use the extra protein ? cochineal beetle extract is , harmful . sends hundreds of people to the emergency room every year . so potentially dangerous that the center for science in the public interest has called for all bug-based dyes to be exterminated . the fda , the food and drug administration , refuses to ban it , but they did announce this year that they will at least start requiring it to be listed in the ingredients , instead of just being " color added " . good news for those of us who ’ d rather listen to the beetles than eat any . of course the labelling law won ’ t go into effect until 2011 , but , until then i have a suggestion for food companies : should you want to make your cherry popsicles red , how about adding some cherries ? please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on food additives . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! this video is misleading . the only people who are harmed by the dye are people who are allergic to it . you can have other reasons to be against squished bugs being added to your food ( hmm … thinking … ) but i don ’ t think you should label a food “ harmful ” because it can cause an allergic reaction in some people . using that reasoning , you ’ d also have to call nuts and seeds harmful ( just to point out the obvious ) . thank you for commenting , barbara . when one is trying to decide if a food is harmful i try to look at risks versus benefits . nuts and seeds have tremendous benefits , but if there ’ s little upside to eating bugs and some people suffer adverse reactions ( whether a “ true ” allergy or not – we ’ re not really sure ) , then on balance i would stick with harmful , don ’ t you think ? you have it right , barbarah ! to the far side , eating “ bugs ” and other insects will be a fine source of protein in humanity ’ s ugly future . if some are allergic , too bad . why is this cropping up a year later ? i would like to know what kind of health issues can be caused by colorants in our foods ? thanks , cooperwhat do you think the possibility is that in these foods kids could also be ingesting insecticides ? artificial colors , carcinogens , cherries , dairy , fda , food additives , insects , yogurt the potential health effects of colorings such as cochineal , a food dye derived from crushed insects . for some of the most recent videos on the harmful effects of insect-derived ingredients : bug appétit : barriers to entomophagy cheese mites and maggotsplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on food additives . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well ! please be sure to check out my associated blog posts : adding fda-approved viruses to meat and soymilk : shake it up !
PLAIN-3391	bottled water vs. tap if you are more of a water person , which is healthier — bottled or tap ? in terms of both chemical and microbiological purity ? for most people , which is healthier — who says bottled ? who says tap ? and the answer is tap , based primarily on bacterial contamination found in some brands of bottled water recently . the only population that should really stick to bottled or filtered is pregnant women during the summer in new jersey , massachusetts , pennsylvania , texas and , maryland , where the chlorination spike has been found a little too high for comfort . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on beverages . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! how does distilled water rate compared to bottled water and tap water ? hi trinda , distilled water is water that has been turned into steam , leaving the impurities such as chlorine , lead , fluoride , washed up pharmaceuticals , and essentially everything else behind . the steam is then condensed to make pure water . this process also kills and removes bacteria , viruses – basically anything that is organic or inorganic . this water is a pure as it gets . while some people claim that the removal of minerals during this process is harmful , we actually get most of our minerals from the food we consume , and not water . therefore , i believe that distilled water , by removing all impurities , is the safest water you can drink.i ’ m sorry but this is completely wrong . while distilling water does remove all inorganic impurities , and kills organic pathogens ( e.g. , bacteria , viruses , etc ) , it does not remove all organic impurities . more specifically volatile organic compounds ( also known as vocs ) will vaporize just as the water does when it is boiled and come along for the ride when the steam is condensed back out into liquid water again . so unfortunately even distilled water can have lots of voc contamination.vocs are filtered by active carbon filters which are standard in drinking water distillers . voc contamination is a myth that is supported by dr mercola this link debunks some of the myths that surround distilled water. http : / / www.sallyanncreed.co.za / 2013 / 07 / the-final-truth-about-distilled-water / i have heard and read that the “ only water that our bodies can actually use to clean their cells , is the water contained in vegetables ” and that “ bottled mineral water only serves to pollute the body , as the minerals have a low bio-availability and the body needs to work to remove them ” .then i am told in conferences that actually there are “ studies that prove that bottled mineral water is good for you and that there are scientific studies proving this ” , although nobody could actually produce any of these studies.i also hear that “ tap water is polluted ” and that with the “ high amounts of pollutants , oestrogen , etc. it is best to avoid it ” .i am then told that the “ only water to drink is reverse osmosis ” , as the “ vegetables we eat will provide the water that the body needs for bodily functions ” and the “ extra water that is drunk – the reverse osmosis – will be pure and therefore not pollute the body , but will serve to lubricate the digestive system ” .then i read that reverse osmosis , being “ empty and containing no minerals , will leach the minerals from the body creating deficiencies ” .another claim that i am now hearing is that we should drink “ kangen water ” , which apparently “ alkalises your tap water ” ( although nobody says what it adds to do this or what is actually filtered from the water , i.e. pollutants , pesticides , etc . ) . it ’ s a filter system that you connect ot your tap water . the claim here is that “ your body absorbs this alkaline water with miraculous effects ” , even going as far to claim that it “ can help cure some forms of cancer ” . nobody explains however how this water can pass through the acidity of the stomach and still end up alkalising the body when absorbed ! there are probably other claims that i have heard and forgotten , but wondered if you have any information or have done any research here ? many thanks … markmark tucker : tap water is highly regulated and tested for safety , whereas other sources are not . you can find water quality reports online from the environmental protection agency if you ’ re in the us . from these reports ( which can be found online ) , you can find what contaminants your tap water may contain , then simply look for a filter that works best for you in your area . from this , you can determine an in-home filtration device that will work best for you . the type of filtration is completely dependent on the quality of the water , so that should be the first step you take.as far as mineral content , whole foods are the best place to obtain minerals , vitamins , and all things necessary in your diet . there may be one supplement worth taking , however . see this video for more information : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / vitamin-supplements-worth-taking / what about the water in the u.k that ’ s fluoridated ? what basic water filter do you recommend for daily drinking ( does pur pitchers do the trick ? ) ? what shower filter ( s ) do you recommend ( i am based in nyc and , like other us cities , the water supply has excessive chlorine , bromine , and fluorine ) .is poland spring water reputable ? i heard recently that tap water is bad for health as the chlorine kills off the body ’ s beneficial bacteria.what about home filtered tap water or boiled mineral water ? chlorine , like fluoride , is an industrial toxin , and should be avoided . tap water in some areas is full of it . all so-called natural spring , well , tap or mineral water , irrespective of whether filtered or boiled , will still contain anything , from ( hopefully ) lifeless bacteria and virus husks to inorganic metals , salts , minerals , trace elements etc . – pollutants all – turning every glass of water into a potentially life threatening cocktail . the powerful water lobby denies it , of course , and produces ( or claims to possess ) studies that offer scientific proof . i remain unconvinced – mainly because of scientific proof to the contrary ( bone density comparisons between consumers in areas with very high and very low mineral content water , for example , where severe osteoporosis incidence was found to be almost double in the high mineral content water area ) . not a paradox – the “ enriched ” water blocks absorption of organic ( food ) calcium , resulting in deficiency . in answer to your question , papayoyo , think h2o . that ’ s what your body cells want , nay , need . h2o , no toxic cocktails . distilled water is almost 100 % h2o . so is ro water . the latter has a waste factor , though , as it is said to take between 10 to 20 liters of tap water to produce a liter of ro water ( depending on the device used , i guess ) .thanks chrish for your informed reply . i ’ m inclined in the same direction of thought . though what would you say to the argument that distilled and ro water leech minerals and nutrients from the body ? isn ’ t all life on the planet sustained by water that is infused with elements from the environment ? isn ’ t perfectly pure water an artificial and unnatural thing ? i guess rain water is pretty pure but on it ’ s way down it must absorb “ stuff ” from the atmosphere.thank you for that question , papayoyo . the bizarre notion of water maliciously leaching valuables from our organism ( in the process leaving the infinitely more available – as no longer organically fused – waste materials , toxins , “ ash ” , etc . , in the body cells ) is persistently being bandied about by – i suspect – the water lobby ( and maybe pension funds ? ) . it has no scientific basis . the opposite is in fact true . pure h2o enhances the efficiency of the metabolism , as h2o will readily transport nutrients through cell walls , and cleanse waste products from the cells in direct exchange . rain is nature ’ s distilled water . the ( mostly man-made ) pollution it picks up in the atmosphere is in fact the “ artificial and unnatural ” thing . being an efficient solvent , water begins breaking down whatever it encounters as soon as it hits the ground . for many simple organisms , amphibians , fish and practically all plants this fortified water is imperative to sustain life . higher organisms generally can ’ t fully utilize the large molecular structure of inorganic minerals etc. and need to obtain the necessary from organic sources ( food ) . drinking the inorganically enriched ( mineral , tap , well , spring ) water will inevitably put strain on the organism , causing mineral deposits in joints , arteries , kidneys etc . , contributing to arthritis , stroke , renal failure , arteriosclerosis etc . , thus effectively reducing human life expectancy … your statements in the last paragraph are interesting . can you please provide research and studies showing what you claim : “ drinking the inorganically enriched ( mineral , tap , well , spring ) water will inevitably put strain on the organism , causing mineral deposits in joints , arteries , kidneys etc . , contributing to arthritis , stroke , renal failure , arteriosclerosis etc . , thus effectively reducing human life expectancy … ” thank you . this is very interesting but i do think it warrants documentation to back it up.thank you but please show who did this research . what study , and who were the authors of it ? otherwise i am to assume that you are just making a theory based on what seems obvious to you . surely you researched this and can provide the information on the study.i can ’ t find a single study that claims that the minerals in mineral water are unhealthy for the human body . can anyone provide some evidence of this ? i like natural mineral water but some people raise concerns so i am curious . i couldn ’ t find a study for you and doubt if one will be done . the makers of mineral water would have nothing to gain . water is what we need . all other substances come from plants with the exception of vit b12 … see excellent series of video ’ s by dr. greger this past february . the best diet is plant based but we need to be careful of some other nutrtients such as ca and iodine … . see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / omnivore-vs-vegan-nutrient-deficiencies-2 / . looking at iodine … see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2 / , of course the details are important see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / avoiding-iodine-deficiency-2 / and especially pregnant women see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / pregnant-vegans-at-risk-for-iodine-deficiency-2 / but as for all substances you can consume too much see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / too-much-iodine-can-be-as-bad-as-too-little / and even with water as a woman died of water intoxication during a radio station contest in sacramento ca.what water do you recommend to drink ? dear dr. greger , we are thinking of buying a water filtration system made with coconut shells that they say makes the water cleaner than any other system with no chemicals , if possible i would like your comments if you are familiar with this system , it ’ s the one with ed bagley advertising for it.thank you for all you do ! should i bother filtering my water ( with something like a brita ) ? http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = zo6snvmmp9kfluoridation is not good.dr. greger covers fluoride here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / the-dangers-of-fluoride / its not as bad as many may claim.in my experience tap water drank regularly causes digestive problems . the overload of minerals overtaxes the system and lowers appetite , nutrients in food are not used adequately ; when i drink tap water or any other brand of natural mineral water i could just keep eating and eating with no satisfaction ( sugars probably get stuck in the bloodstream , maybe because of the overload ) when i switch to purified water satiation comes way quicker and energy returns . i see this same effects on my dog . also mineral waters take time to completely get out of the system , so it takes some time for the appetite and the adequate use of nutrients to return.the overload of minerals overtaxes the organs and sends me to a deep sleep in the afternoon.but mineral water also makes me feel happier and active during the day , so i think there should be a middle point , mineral water is very powerful so i just use it sparingly.i have no studies about this information this is just what i ’ ve observed.good morning dr. greger … .i found this article which sounds like it was onboard for water consumption , but a few items in it … especially # 3 have me concerned … http : / / www.curejoy.com / content / busted15-myths-drinking-water / i follow http : / / www.watercure.com and dr. b and since switching to a wfpb diet in sept 2014 the only thing i drink is water … .well the occasional glass of red wine … but 99 % water : ) can you please comment specifically on # 1 where they say that all liquids count … i don ’ t believe drinking coffee and milk should count as water intake and # 3 about water and fiber creating blockages in the intestines … my belief is that if you don ’ t have an underlying health issue and drink water when you are thirsty and get a minimum of amount … ( what is that ? ) you should be good to go . thanks again for your videos … i believe them to be life saving ! i recently found information that has reversed my original position on the best water to drink and wanted to share.i found the following paper which in part states : “ not only does completely demineralised water ( distillate ) have unsatisfactory organoleptic properities , but it also has a definite adverse influence on the animal and human organism ” . after evaluating the available health , organoleptic , and other information , the team recommended that demineralised water contain 1 . ) a minimum level for dissolved salts ( 100 mg / l ) , bicarbonate ion ( 30 mg / l ) , and calcium ( 30 mg / l ) ; 2 . ) an optimum level for total dissolved salts ( 250-500 mg / l for chloride-sulfate water and 250-500 mg / l for bicarbonate water ) ; 3 . ) a maximum level for alkalinity ( 6.5 meq / l ) , sodium ( 200 mg / l ) , boron ( 0.5 mg / l ) , and bromine ( 0.01 mg / l ) .the lowest morbidity was associated with water having calcium levels of 30-90 mg / l , magnesium levels of 17-35 mg / l , and tds of about 400 mg / l ( for bicarbonate containing waters ) . the author concluded that such water could be considered as physiologically optimum.http : / / www.who.int / water _ sanitation _ health / dwq / nutrientschap12.pdfafter finding the above information i set about searching for a water source that matches the who recommendation . turns out there is a natural spring water source near me that is within the suggested parameters , bottled locally , and which the company performs and provides regular water analysis results . they ozonate , bottle ( glass or polycarbonate ) and have the water delivered to me within 72hours of collection.i am capable of modifying / making my water parameters match the recommendation , however , in my opinion it ’ s not practical to expect that an under the sink unit and a home kitchen based lab can do a better job at water handling than mother nature and a multimillion dollar water distribution company , the latter of which are subject to random testing and inspections by the canadian government and the various certifying bodies to which they subscribe.i hope this helps someone . the .pdf provided is a good read ! beverages , chlorination , fecal contamination , food poisoning , foodborne illness , plastic , pregnancy , water , women 's health for most people which is healthier ?

thanks , elynhello elyn , excellent question ! many have been wondering about this with all the talk of “ juice fasting ” that have been going on . check out dr. greger ’ s video all about juicing here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / fruit-juice-fail / essentially , you throw out 90 % of the nutrients when you juice a fruit or vegetables . regarding oranges for example , it takes 3 oranges to make a cup of orange juice and its still not nutritionally equivalent to 1 single plain orange.hope this helps ! well , that ’ s strange , i thought that juicing was the opposite – as a glass of juice was equivalent to a lb of produce.it depends on what you measure . you can get more water and more calories in juice , but the question is , what are you leaving behind to get that ? part of the question is , does fiber increase or decrease nutritional value ? i would actually be curious as well whether the orange study was referring to antioxidants or to some other aspect of nutrician.using my vitamix i put the whole orange in rind and all , some fresh ginger , some unsweetend almond milk , a frosen banana , uncooked oatmeal and some greens . makes a great smoothie in the morning oh also some chia seeds.i use whole raw almonds ( 1 part to 4 parts water ) , it ’ s cheaper buying almond milk and saves a step over making it.toxins , tell us : is that also true of sauerkraut juice ? my reference was only to whole foods in terms of preserving fiber and phytonutrients . eating foods in their whole form is usually better then their juice.anyone – what ’ s the rationale behind the sudden drop of nutrient content when juicing ? the method / machine behind the process ? or the over-exposition to air / oxigenic stress on the liquid ? i think that he recommends blending over juicing , so i would guess the big loss is from throwing away the solids.any tips on how to add more cloves to our diet ? i ’ m assuming that people are using ground cloves somehow ? hello crystal ! a great way to get cloves into your diet is to start drinking decaf chai tea. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / the-healthiest-beverage-2 / ginger snap flavored larabars also contain cloves . you can also throw some cloves into soups.hope this helps ! great ideas ! i didn ’ t know about the chai . i ’ m a caffeine free girl . my only concern with eating “ decaf ” products is that they are known to be processed with chemicals . i ’ ll look into it . i love chai … thanks again ! consider using chai made with roobios tea , which is low or no caffeiine.lara bars are gmo backing bastardsi ’ m not sure what the bruhaha was about , but that is clearly not the case now : “ we hear your passion and concerns regarding the labeling of gmo ingredients . please know that lärabar will continue to use non-gmo ingredients in all of our products , and label our products as “ non-gmo . ” in addition , we are proudly enrolled in the non-gmo project . ” fromhttp : / / www.larabar.com / gmo-labelinghe may be referring to the fact that larabar is owned by general mills , which donated $ 1.2 million to defeat prop 37 and is assuredly doing the same now to defeat the gmo labeling referendum i-522 in washington . this time they are being more crafty , under cover of the grocery manufacturer ’ s association ( gma ) . the point is , sending revenue to larabar is also sending part of it to general mills . that is working against our own interests . sorry larabar , this is regardless of your product ’ s non-gmo status.thank you for this information . i will drop larabar from my shopping list . i ’ ll have to see what other general mills products i might buy . not too many , i ’ m sure.for some context , please check out my associated blog post the best detox ! this is quackery . the antioxidant scores of these foods are measured using test-tube measures like orac , teac , and frap : they tell you absolutely nothing about the bioavailability or bioactivity of those antioxidants . cyanide has a very high antioxidant score ; that doesn ’ t make it healthy.as it happens , i agree that cabbage ( red or green ) is a great health bargain — but that ’ s because it ’ s a cheap * cruciferous * vegetable , consumption of which has been linked to lower risk of some cancers . the phytochemicals thought to be responsible for this protective effect are believed to be beneficial because of their actions on sex hormone metabolism , not any “ antioxidant ” buzz.can i really just start slicing off pieces of cabbage and adding them to things ? i always fear the whole thing will start to turn brown if i don ’ t figure out what to do with it – all at once.don ’ t worry , you can pull a leaf off at a time . my mother grew cabbages and stored them in the basement . i would snack on them from time to time in the fall and winter after school . they have a nice juiciness / crispness for snacking on . the cabbage will keep just fine as you eliminate the outer leaves.i wouldn ’ t say it is quackery , although you probably do have a point about bio-availability . to me , i think it would be best to combine the vitamin , mineral , and bioavailable antioxidants in some formula to determine best value per dollar spent . i ’ d have to say , however , i think i know part of the answer : eat in season . produce in season is often local and is usually relatively low in price , but there is more to it than that.hi dr. greger , i would like to know your thoughts on the use of serrapeptase regarding it ’ s supposed ability to remove ‘ dead tissue ’ from the body ( and specifically arterial plaque build-up ) . all of the proponents of the product sight dr. hans napier ’ s results of his study 20 + years ago ( germany ) , but i do not see any more recent studies on this supposed ‘ miracle ’ enzyme . i currently am taking 40,000 units a day . thanking you in advance.enzymes can be beneficial in our intestines if certain conditions such as pancreatic insufficiency where patients don ’ t make the digestive enzymes they need . enzymes are proteins with many amino acids which are broken down by our intestines . so any claims that enzymes contribute to the reduction of plaque is not consistent with our current understanding of human physiology . improvement of blood flow via the nitrous oxide system and reversal of plaque has been demonstrated . the best introduction to this is dr. esselstyn ’ s book on preventing and reversing heart disease . for the abstracts and articles you can view the video ’ s and check out sources cites on nutritionfacts.org … you might start with http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / arterial-acne / to help understand this complicated issue.dr. greger , which one would have more antioxidents acai berries or amla powder ? thanks , ann – milton , onmy records , which show sources when they ’ re stated but often copy ads , show amla powder with orac values ( no frap ) from 130000 to 538400 – no tester named . açai is lower : dehydrated 53600 [ brunswick labs ] or 61000 [ dry weight , no source ] ; freeze-dried 161400 or freeze-dried powder 102700 . all measures per 100 grams . haven ’ t the foggiest idea of prices.sorry to be late with an answer , but i only recently discovered this delightful site.i think you can find his opinion on amla in the “ pink smoothie ” video or similar.dr : gregerdo you recommend using ceramic coated nonstick cookware ? thank youi love the question ! what cookware can we use , if we are aiming for a mostly oil-free style of cooking , that isn ’ t harmful to our bodies directly , and isn ’ t harmful to the environment ( production , disposal ) . people who have birds know that teflon can kill them , as can any plastic that starts to burn . try making a crepe on a stainless steal pan … it just sticks and sticks and makes a big mess , but not a crepe.if you cook with a few tablespoons of water at a time to keep the veggies from sticking to the pan it works just as well as oil would.that is fine for cooking veggies , but doesn ’ t work a darn for pancakes , crepes , or french toast . you need the right pan for the job.funny you say that , i tried making e2 pancakes and it was very difficult with my pan . your very right.well seasoned cast-iron is heavy , but it is also the best non-stick fry-pan , and can last several lifetimes . i started with my grand-father ’ s in college.cast iron works fine for crepes.now , ceramic is not the same as teflon , not by a long shot . basically ceramic is just that , ceramic , natural material , like glass , sort of , and as such it would be totally safe , however , some ceramic cookware seems to be less ceramic than others , so you still need to be careful . teflon is no good.regarding high orac foods ( cloves ! ) , does one need to ingest the clove ( or cinnimon or other spices ) or is the value available if the clove ( etc . ) is boiled and turned into a tea ? is there dilution to the orac value by creating a tea ? mabye there is a better question or way to ask this question that you could share.cabbage last forever ? i thought i only had 3-4 days after i sliced into this yummy veg ! can i use mccormick ground cinnamon to be mix with honey ? is this the right cinnamon ? thankshow i wish i could get an answerhow does purple cabbage compare to the first superfood i heard about , kale ? kale ’ s orac per 100 grms or 3 ½ ounces is variously 1860 or 1770 , no source given . i have nothing for purple cabbage , but red ’ s is2496 or 2252 , frap 798 ; cooked , orac 3145 frap 2153 . apparently these were from various usda publications ; they ’ ve found the figures too varied and / or irksome to continue gathering them , but there are online sources of orac data from their attempts . i think from a reasonable guess at price and the figures above , you could get a good estimate.purple cabbage * is * red cabbage.are there any studies on the benefits of powdered green superfood drinks ? great info doc ! i ’ m on a very tight budget and super stressed . i need all the antioxidants i can get right now . thank you ! hi dr greger , i wanted to ask , when you say that in purple cabbage are 47594 antioxidants , that is equal to 100 grams ? how can i know how much antioxidants i ate from the cabbage and if i ate the required amount thanks ! ! hi , i ’ ve watched the video about pill supplements potentially being more harmful for health than getting them from produce . is the same true for superfood powder ?

can dairy alternatives made of soy also have a negative affect on acne ? all non-plant milk has hormones in it . the entire purpose of mammals producing milk is to provide growth hormones to their offspring.well , it didn ’ t work for me . i ’ ve had acne problems ever since puberty . i stopped dairy 5-6 months ago and i still have the same annoying problem at the same severity . this is very disappointing tome since i was really hoping that if i gave up my favorite foods , i would loose the acne problem.i wonder if the acne-dairy connection is a myth and there is some kind of flaw in the study . just wondering.the main thing about dairy we are worried about is the insulin like growth factor . what else are you eating on a daily basis as some foods ( like soy protein isolate found in clif products ) prove to be worse than dairy . also , are you supplementing any proteins ? this will have a similar affect . are you eating a lot of meats ? toxins : thanks for your interest.i have been a vegetarian for 15 years and went completely vegan in the last 5-6 months . the only bars i am eating are bars like lara bar which is just fruits and nuts with no protein isolates . i do not add any special proteins to my diet other than what comes naturally in beans , whole grains like quinoa , and some organic tofu . in the last 5-6 months , i started cooking all my own foods from recipe books that are vegan , low or no-fat and based on whole plant foods.just to give this a complete fair shot , i even stopped sampling cookies and other goodies that co-workers bring to work . when i slice cheese for my dog once a week , i make sure to put the knife right in the dishwasher so that i don ’ t use it for myself . a couple weeks ago , i even cooked and packed all my own foods for a three day seminar instead of eating the foods that everyone else ate so that i would be eating both vegan and healthy.as a sample of what i eat : yesterday ’ s lunch consisted of home-made african kale and yam stew ( delicious – and with organic kale and organic yams ) from the happy herbivore cookbook and “ hippie loaf ” from the same cookbook with a mushroom gravy on top that came from a book on preventing and reversing heart disease – or maybe it was the one on preventing diabeties . i can ’ t remember right now , but they are both good books.as near as i can tell , i am eating the ideal diet for health ( and slaving away in the kitchen for what feels like forever ) and my face is still a mess . i don ’ t think we understand acne very well at all.you are in fact eating extraordinarily well . good job , i cannot assist you but i will notify dr. greger for you and we will see what he thinks is the issue . but as far as i can tell your diet is spot on.are you using any products on your face ? jennifer : thank you for your interest too.i do use an over-the-counter acne medicine – sometimes . sometimes i just give up and do nothing . i haven ’ t used any kind of make-up in over 20 years . other than the acne medicine and soap , i put nothing on my face.vinegar is a great skin cleanser . it helps kill some of the bad bacteria while keeping your skin soft . at first , you may want to dilute the vinegar with water [ i boil mine , let it cool ] until you find the right balance for your skin . i now use full-strength and i haven ’ t had a blemish in 10 + years ! i still had acne after eating healthy and exercising . i think probiotics were the ace in the heart of acne for me . i was eating yogurt and drinking store bought kefir but it wasn ’ t enough for me … so i looked up homemade kefir and purchased some kefir grains online and now my acne has finally disappeared . also having a good lotion in the winter helps if you have dry skin , a few drops of jojoba oil mixed with the lotion helps as well.great job on becoming vegan ! i thought i might let you know that mine is a similar story : 100 % vegan , low-fat too and still troubled by acne . first of all , just because there are some counter-examples such as us , does not mean that an overall trend is absent . although a vegan diet has failed to solve this specific problem that we have , it still works with the * majority * of people . so i wouldn ’ t doubt the study that dr. gregor cites . my suggestion to you is to keep experimenting . you have tried diet , what about sleep ? are your sleeping patterns somewhat irregular ? what about trying to go to bed earlier ? remember : diet , as important as it is , is not the only factor controlling acne . you might also want to experiment with natural anti-biotic substances like vinegar or a tea tree oil cream ( just don ’ t get in your eyes ! ) . lastly think about this : for you a vegan has not cured your acne , but think of all of the other problems you are saving yourself ! heart disease , diabetes , cancer … its a long list ! keep experimenting and stay vegan . wishing you the best ! thanks for the thoughts m.k. you are right about the other benefits . i don ’ t think i made a bad decision . just doing truth in reporting my experience.hello dr. greger , this site is an excellent easy to understand source of health information ! thank you ! are there any other studies that show links between diet and acne ? there are sources that claim certain foods are bad and others are good , but none have research.also , is inflammation like acne isolated or does it indicate inflammation in the rest of the body as well ? thanks , allanallank : re : “ are there any other studies that show links between diet and acne ? ” i can ’ t answer your question definitely , but i can suggest that you keep checking back on this site for the current “ video-of-the-day ” . dr. greger is going through volume 8 of his dvds . i haven ’ t watched all of volume 8 ( while i own the dvd , i prefer the pace of watching one a day ) , but i have seen the chapter headings . it looks like dr. greger will be covering more studies related to acne soon . so , maybe at least some of your questions will be answered by video.there is a new study not yet published except on line in the j amer acad dermatology . i can provide a pdf if you ( or dr. greger ) can send me a live email address that i can send an attachement to.dr. greger , it happened the opposite on me . i have more acnes now after i became vegan than before . my puberty years i didn ’ t get much acnes , now i am in my thirties , i get them a lot on the side of my face near and behind the ears to my neck . i am wondering what i did wrong . my personal toiletries are the same.i became completely vegan a year ago from fulltime meat eater ; breakfast , lunch and dinner . i am lactose intolerance so i didn ’ t consume dairy much , except occasionally ice cream and pizzas.i eat lots of fresh veggies , beans , salads , rice , ezekiel bread , sweet potatoes , tofu , nuts and seeds . i limit processed vegan diet , such as tofurky . i am using oil for baking and stir-frying.i am happy with vegan diet i can control my weight easily than before . but i hate my acnes.so dairy free almond milk is a safe bet ? yes , but keep the sugar content low ( unsweetened ) in all non-mammal milks . i know , the french vanilla and chocolate are soooo tempting – but such a no-no . those carbs absolutely are a significant part of the problem. acne , adolescence , dairy , hormones , milk , skin health a dairy-free diet may improve acne vulgaris . for some of the latest videos on the link between dairy and acne : saving lives by treating acne with diet national dairy council on acne and milk skim milk and acne the acne-promoting effects of milkplease feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on acne . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos--please feel free to explore them as well !

five million packages of broccoli sprouts were tested for pathogens . overall , did they find that raw broccoli sprouts are harmful , harmless or helpful ? less than one in a thousand containers were contaminated . so , go for it ! though raw alfalfa sprouts are indeed too risky to eat , eggs are linked every year literally 1000 times more food poisoning than sprouts . salmonella infected eggs cause a food-borne epidemic every year in the united states , sickening more than 100,000 americans annually . i intend to source some broccoli sprouts and try them : ) karen : that ’ s great ! if you like them they ’ re easy to sprout yourself ! please feel free to leave any other comments or pose questions below . want to know whether raw or cooked broccoli is better ?

PLAIN-343	three brands of nutritional yeast contain detectable lead levels but the risk is minimal note from dr. greger : in short , we found detectable amounts of lead in samples of frontier , kal , and whole foods brand nutritional yeast , but the lead levels were so low that they all comply with the exceedingly ( and justifiably ) strict california prop 65 standards . still , i advise pregnant women who eat more than a third of a cup a day on a regular basis choose a different brand . no detectable lead levels were found in bob ’ s red mill , bragg , dr. fuhrman , red star , or now foods brand nutritional yeast . nutritional yeast has grown in popularity and is being introduced into many new dishes and recipes . it has a nice “ cheesy ” flavor and texture that can be used in sauces and soups or sprinkled over salads and popcorn . dr. greger recently covered how the beta glucan fiber in nutritional yeast can modulate our immune system and help to maintain our body ’ s defense against pathogens ( see dr. greger ’ s video on nutritional yeast to prevent the common cold ) . it seems beta glucans can be found in many foods , including mushrooms , which have been shown to boost immunity as well . a safety concern arose when dr. greger was notified that california ’ s prop 65 warning stickers were found on packages of nutritional yeast , suggesting there ’ s something in it exceeding cancer or reproductive safety limits . it turns out the problem was lead . there are many contaminants in the environment and in our food supply , even found in our children , which is probably why california has such strict guidelines on contamination . for example , california considers candies with lead levels in excess of 0.10 parts per million ( ppm ) to be excessively contaminated . state law requires products that contain more than half of a microgram of lead per daily serving to carry a label warning consumers . could nutritional yeast carry lead levels this high ? we reached out to some of the companies who produce nutritional yeast in hopes to better understand the situation . we asked if they perform lead testing and if they could share any information . the results of dr. greger ’ s inquiries can be found in his video here . he was frustrated by the lack of responsiveness and so decided we should take it upon ourselves to do our own testing . the nutritionfacts research fund was created and thanks to generous donor support we tested samples from 8 companies for the presence of lead in hopes to spur them to do their own testing . we hired an independent lab to conduct our tests for lead . i shipped out 8 samples of nutritional yeast in their original package . the lab used standard practices for lead testing known as official methods of analysis set by aoac international . lab technicians determined the lead values based on california prop 65 standards . here are the results from the brands we tested : bob ’ s red mill - test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . bragg – test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . dr. fuhrman - test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . frontier coop – test report shows lead levels at 0.021 ppm . it would take six tablespoons a day ( based on the manufacture ’ s listed density ) to exceed the california office of environmental health hazard assessment maximum allowable dose level ( madl ) for chemicals causing reproductive toxicity . * kal – test report shows lead levels at 0.011 ppm . it would take seven tablespoons a day to exceed the madl . * now foods – test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . red star – test report shows no detectable lead ( < 0.01 ppm ) . whole foods - test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppm . it would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the madl . * joseph , are you comfortable with the fact that nutritional yeast is grown using synthetic vitamins ? even when a company states on the package “ un-fortified / not fortified nutritional yeast ” , that just means the product has not been fortified after the product ( yeast ) has been grown . but to my direct knowledge , any nutritional yeast you buy in whole foods or other health food store ( all the big brands of nutritional yeast , are actually grown using synthetic vitamins . if they don ’ t then add the vitamins in post-growth , well , they are allowed to label it un-fortified . end result , one is still ingesting synthetic , artificial vitamins.how does this sit with your nutritional path on this journey . ? are you at peace ingesting these non-food based vitamins in your diet , as a result of ingesting nutritional yeast ? how about you dr. greger ? synthetic thiamin , niacin , minerals , etc . ? does this really resonate with a plant-based diet ? joseph : reading the article , i was thinking about the same thing . the members of the vitamin b family in the nutritional yeast products i ’ ve seen are added ( either before or after the fermentation , i don ’ t know ) to the product , not directly from the yeast in the product itself . i might as well take b-complex pills , which are cheaper and more convenient if my objective is to get vitamin b. to the guest : there ’ s a product , made in switzerland , called bio-strath . from what i can gather from the manufacturer ’ s website , the b vitamins in it are not added . however , there ’ s no way of knowing how much vitamin b it has because the manufacturer doesn ’ t publish the information . and i ’ ve never used it , so i don ’ t know how effective it is.more than b-vitamins nutritional yeast offers beta-glucans . i think another unfortified brand is dr. fuhrman if you ’ re trying to avoid added vitamins.yeah , but are you comfortable eating nutritional yeast that has been fortified with synthetic b vitamins ? is this a reason not to , for you , or according to the science ? nothing about vegan eating says supplements are bad . i think the main goal of this website is to be healthy , rather than a religious adherence to popular definitions of purity . i think it ’ s up to personal choice whether someone eats nutritional yeast , as it ’ s mostly used for flavor ( we still need b12 supplements ) , unless research comes out saying it ’ s not healthful.i agree with you supplements are not bad . i take several supplements . the problem with nutritional yeast is twofold : 1 . nutritional yeast is a supplement masquerading as food . 2 . dr. greger usually recommends supplements only if they are truly necessary ( examples : b12 , d ) , so i ’ m intrigued as to why he recommends nutritional yeast . if it ’ s for beta-glucans , there ’ re other , whole foods that naturally contains them.supplements can be made by natural means , ingredients . b vitamins in supplements are synthetic , chemical based , totally not-natural , not plant-based , and have been ingested by humans for very little time , maybe a billionth of our existence . something does not seem natural as far as ingesting a chemical to get vitamins that humans are supposed to get from food . no ? do the research on how b vitamins are made , petroleum , etc . these things seem like drugs as much as drugs seem like drugs . why ? cause they are . it is semantics here . and nutritional yeast seems to be a supplement , chemical supplement , not a food . but hey , maybe these synthetic vitamins help some people . i am open to it.please test the lead levels in sunflower seeds and other other raw nuts and seeds that are commonly bought by vegans . sunflower seeds are known to pull lead out of the soil . i can not help but wonder about daily ingestion of nuts and seeds as far as heavy metals , current testing 2015.please also test lead levels in leafy greens , organic , grown in california . i read that current-day leafy greens absorb lead and cadmium , maybe no big deal , but hey , if you guys are testing , let ’ s go for it ! i ’ d rather not be taking in so much lead and cadmium , if this is the case.good points ! i just wrote about thallium and kale . perhaps this could be another nutritionfacts research fund project if we obtain enough donations and interest ? great suggestion ! chocolate is another plant that traps environmental heavy metals . worth looking into if you ’ re a cocoa lover.fantastic job guys in pulling this test together ! and in so fully explaining what the results actually mean for us as consumers . i ’ m so glad i don ’ t have to throw out my jar of red star in the pantry … does the whole foods brand include the one in the bulk bin or was it something else ? it was their private label whole foods brand nutritional yeast , not from the bulk bin ( which i think is red star brand at least at the whole foods near me ) .there must be a typo in there somewhere , because you sayfrontier coop – test report shows lead levels at 0.021 ppm whole foods – test report shows lead levels at 0.012 ppmbut for both you say “ it would take six tablespoons a day to exceed the madl ” although the first product shows nearly twice the value of the second.good point , but keep in mind the manufacturer ’ s differs per brand . if you look at the lab report on frontier , 16 grams of yeast is about 1 / 4 cup . so it ’ s lighter than whole foods . the main thing is no lead was found anywhere in dangerous levels and you ’ d have to eat a boat load of nutritional yeast daily for any potential concerns.if you look at the reports whole foods is nearly twice as heavy as the frontier yeast ( 15 per 2t serving versus 8g per 2t serving ) . that ’ s how frontier can have nearly twice the lead concentration but about the same amount per serving . does that make sense bruce ? this is great to see. some cheese sauce recipes require 6 tbsp of this so i really need to watch for the brand . i was buying natural grocers in house brand but will def switch to one of the recommended ones . thanks a lot.i still think any brand is fine . even for cheese sauce , i doubt 6 tablespoons of the yeast is consumed , unless the dish is not shared . regardless , what i find interesting is the huge amount of buffer room when maximum allowable dose levels are calculated . it may be worthy to point out regulations on herbal supplements are far less strict and lead can be found in products up to like 10 micrograms per serving ! what about interactions with blood thinners ? ask your doctor if there seems to be any , but i have not heard of nutritional yeast causing drug-nutrients interactions.i am joesph just read somewhere about it … maybe just the old thinners ( warfarin ) and not the new ones.aha. if you find the article or study you read feel free to post it here and we can investigate more . thanks , vince.i ’ ll look for it joe … thanksno ! very different stuff , as red yeast rice is not recommended . glad we tackled this thanks for providing the link.ok bud and thanks . : ) so challenging to know what is being “ offered ” to us consumers . we are seeking a reliable source of organic nutritional yeast , and preferably one that does not kill us . knowing more about nutritional yeast ( ny ) is helpful , frustrating and concerning . rather know than not . we have been discussing eliminating ny from our lives period . thus aiming for good health , seek only organic produce , actually seeking true veganic produce as well . we care about what it is we provide our bodies with , and what we share with others . organic celery and other veggies can be dehydrated and made into powders in place of salty flavours … maybe together we can brain flow and find a replacement of this fraudulent nutritional yeast as well ? do not trust anything from bragg ’ s since we learnt about its deeply hidden and yes , dark secrets . shame on them as well . let us all rise and start refusing to be toxic wasteland filtration units by becoming community aware ( that means sharing and informing one another for the benefit of all and the planet ) . do we sound extreme ? what are bragg ’ s deeply hidden dark secrets . give creditable sources please.let us start here , contains a lot of the information one could seek out by googling the product of bragg ’ s itself . keep in mind just because bragg ’ s response feel low key does not remove the toxic end product results . ultimately we each decide what it is we allow in lives to nourish us , we feel it is wise to back away from the questionable things . we feel this is such the case with bragg ’ s , and we do not feel we have seen any accountability from bragg ’ s itself , from the mislabelling misleading its consumers saying it contained no msg , to the fact is is not a low sodium option ; one teaspoon of soy sauce contains 177 mg of sodium , and the same amount of bragg liquid aminos contains 280 mg. soooo much not right with it at all . here is a link that combines a lot of the information you are welcome to verify as credible to yourself , and please feel free to share what you find out . lots of love to you and thanks for asking.http : / / theashbulletin.blogspot.ca / 2011 / 02 / danger-of-bragg-liquid-aminos.htmlthe link you shared is just a blog with peoples opinions and fear mongering . not a credible source . even the ex-bragg employee says there is nothing unhealthy about the liquid aminos.lulu , i appreciate the link but i have always avoided braggs liquid amino since it clearly prints the very high sodium level that you point out is much higher that traditional soy sauce , itself a very high sodium source . i would hope any well intentioned vegan would avoid high sodium products and thanks again for pointing this out . since i see it every year at vegetarian summerfest , some people clearly do not know.bragg does not claim health benefits from the liquid aminos . bragg liquid aminos is a healthy alternative to soy and tamari sauce . no table salt or preservatives are added.kikkoman soy sauce has 307mg sodium per teaspoon , the less sodium version has 192mg sodium per teaspoon . ingredients water , wheat , soybeans , salt , sodium benzoate ; less than 1 / 10 of 1 % as a preservative.bragg liquid aminos contains 320mg of sodium per teaspoon serving . if less sodium is desired , use the 6oz.bragg liquid aminos spray bottle and dilute it ( 2 / 3 bragg liquid aminos to 1 / 3 distilled water ) before using or spraying on food . ingredients : bragg liquid aminos is not fermented , is gluten-free and made from non-gmo soybeans and purified water . it is an excellent alternative for tamari and soy sauce.bragg does not add any msg to its liquid amino products . however , msg is found naturally occurring in many foods , such as mushrooms , tomatoes , parmesan cheese , and soybeans . since bragg liquid aminos is made from soybeans , there can be some very small amounts of naturally occurring msg . patricia bragg is personally very opposed to adding msg as a food ingredient to foods , and she is very sensitive to msg . many of our customers who are very sensitive to msg have never had any adverse reactions to bragg liquid aminos.in deep gratitude of your divine presencelots of love lulu love rose wild @ seagrass.caif bragg ’ s is so bad , why wouldn ’ t you provide links to show what you are saying is true ? sounds like a bunch of malarkey.helpful would be information on who up the distribution chain actually manufactures the nutritional yeast that is then labeled by those that were tested . i doubt all are manufacturers themselves . this company make the one i ’ m told that is sold in bulk at my local sprouts : lesaffre . i couldn ’ t find any relevant information on their website . bummer.lesaffre is the corporation that owns red star , in which we found no detectable lead.does red star offer any organic nutritional yeast options ? thank you for bringing this awareness forward . lots of love lului am not aware of any organic brand of nutritional yeast.there are several brands of organic nutritional yeast . starwest botanicals , from the fields , raw vegan source , bioreal , are some sold on amazon.thanks for that clarification , dr. g. googling the two confirms it ( it ’ s just not prominently stated on lasaffre ’ s website ) .thank you so much for doing this . so happy to see these tests and setting up the testing fund . wonderful stuff nf team . keep up the excellent work.i am wondering and i think i already know the answer to this question , but this kind of regards nutritional yeast . some nutritional yeasts have quite a bit of vitamin b12 , and there are other fortified products like non dairy milks than can provide quite a bit of b12 per serving ( my almond milk has i think over 100 percent ) yet it is recommended to still take a supplement . i guess i was just wondering why that is ? i have a mathylcobalamin that i take every 2-3 weeks or so , and i always kind of worry that i am not getting enough i guess ? we also garden and i try to eat some soil … i guess i want some closure as to if the fortified food b12 is absorbed or not ? hi alexis . the b12 in nutritional yeast should count toward the daily value , however , in some cases it might not be enough and a supplement may be needed . i just wrote all about this in a recent comment on b12 . let me know if that helps answer your question ? thanks , josephyes ! thank you so much , that totally answers my questions ! = ) it is reassuring to have the knowledge and act according to it ! alexisthis is great , fun information . thanks for doing this ! do we know what the next project is going to be for the nutritionfacts research fund ? if there is a big announcement on what the next project is going to be , maybe that will spur a bunch of new donations … thanks , thea ! we hope to know soon . we ’ re looking into future projects for the nutritionfacts research fund . stay tuned for more information everyone … just a comment / suggestion : you use ppm , micrograms , and tablespoons in your article which is a common problem in nutritional discussions . these measurements do not translate well . i appreciate that you used the tablespoon to help relate the amounts to my diet . perhaps a note on the relationships between the measurements would help ? going from micrograms to tablespoons via the 1,000 / fold safety net firmly placed me in the “ just-trust-his-math ” state . i ’ d rather be in the “ that-makes-clear-sense-to-me ” state … if you get what i mean . thank you for all your articles and videos . my comment pales compared to the good work you do.thanks for the great suggestion . perhaps we could have kept the values in micrograms . everyone has access to the laboratory reports and they can see the limit used for detection , the results , and the micrograms of lead found per serving . thanks for your nice comment and please continue to suggest ways to improve our website.on a related note , consumer labs found what they consider significant levels of lead and / or cadmium in the majority of the 21 cocoa and chocolate products they tested . i had been using unsweetened baking cocoa liberally , based in large part on info presented here , but their report certainly has given me pause . might it be time to update your cocoa info ? can anyone refute these ? ( i ’ d love to still eat nutritional yeast on occasion , but it was one of the last highly processed substances that i gave up when i made the switch to a whole-food , plant-based diet years ago . ) here are at least three potential issues with nutritional yeast of which i am aware : 1 – folic acid : most brands of nutritional yeast ( incuding bragg ) contain synthetic folic acid , which is bad news for health . ( folate , which you can get in whole plants , is just fine ) . you can buy dr. fuhrman ’ s ( pricey ) nutritional yeast if you want to avoid this issue . read about it here : http : / / www.drfuhrman.com / library / folic _ acid _ dangers _ and _ prenatal _ vitamins.aspx2 – neurotoxic msg : anything with that “ umami ” flavor is bound to be excitotoxic , almost by definition . * see here : http : / / www.daystarbotanicals.com / nutritionalyeast.html · 3 – genetically modified : the preferred source of carbohydrate for yeast is molasses from sugar beets or sugarcane . if it ’ s made using beet molasses , i would wager that the beets are genetically modified . does anyone have good information on this ? * here ’ s an excerpt from # 2 : “ i really didn ’ t want to believe what i had heard … i had enjoyed nutritional yeast on pop corn , in many vegetarian / vegan caseroles and menu items , and sprinkled on all manner of foods — and of course , in my “ green drink ” . this stuff is absolutely wonderful and delicious ! but now i had to come to terms with what we had learned . would i put my head in the sand and cling to my beloved nutritional yeast , or would i be an honest health reformer ? first , i would try to disprove dr. blaylock ’ s findings , as best i could , so that i might , in good conscience , continue using this delicious taste enhancer that doubles as a nutrition supplement … ” it doesn ’ t seem there are many studies to confirm any of these claims other than some epa regulations for manufacturers . the gmo question is a good one . i would simply ask the companies themselves if that is a huge issue . i can help look into more if you insist . this was a big topic of discussion on the previous yeast video . i also suggest reading thru the comments as other user left some valuable comments . i think there are far more worrisome products on the market than nutritional yeast . the good news is at least our results didn ’ t find any lead at dangerous levels.thanks , joseph . according to fuhrman , folic acid is clearly health-damaging … that ’ s enough ( for me ) to rule out all nutritional yeast products except fuhrman ’ s , which costs $ 36 / lb . and unless i ’ m mistaken , free glutamic acid is petty much as health damaging as msg … so that ’ s two strikes . i don ’ t base my eating decisions on the fact that other food choices are more worrisome ! that ’ s a good point “ i don ’ t base my eating decisions on the fact that other food choices are more worrisome ! ” however i still have yet to see any research about the harmful affects of free glutamic acid and nutritional yeast . the whole reason we tested for lead was because the yeast has been found to contain beneficial immune modulating properties . certainly you can avoid it if you ’ d like : - ) or go for fuhrman ’ s brand if more comfortable . furthermore , msg doesn ’ t appear harmful . feel free to post research studies on here and we can look into the glutamic acid concerns more . thanks , laurie.joseph- many ingredients are labeled as excitotoxins because of dr. blaylock ’ s findings . his findings have been regurgitated by many but where is the science ? when will we ever know ? exactly ! would love to learn more about this topic from published research studies.excellent article and thank you for the test result and detailed explanation . keep up the great work ! thanks johnny ! if you have not already , please consider keeping up with the new videos posted every weekday and subscribe to the daily video feed ! best wishes , josephi tried eating nutritional yeast for a while . i did not feel good while eating eat and i did not eat a lot of it at a time . i no longer eat it and do not miss it and do not feel that it is necessary in mine or anyone elses diet . but each get to choose for themselves.how about any other products with yeast ? wine , ferments , soy sauce , bread , kefir , kombucha ? how do they make you feel ? the only product you mentioned that i use is bread , and i do not eat that often . for grains i eat mostly brown rice , millet and oats . as far as how the bread makes me fell – i do not have a problem with it , but do not eat it very often.with the proliferation of coal-fired plants in china , the probability of heavy metal contamination in exported produce has dramatically increased . china burns 4 billion tons of coal in power plants , homes & factories every year . yet there are no checks for this even for ‘ organic ’ labeled produce . a farm exporting produce that is adjacent to a coal plant , or even a smog choked city , is not a pretty picture . yet who would know ? i eat several ounces of ‘ organic ’ pumpkin seeds daily that i ’ ve learned were grown in china . are there any home testing kits that you would recommend that can at least check for the presence of lead , mercury and cadmium ? if you can ’ t answer this directly , could you post such information on your web site ? thanks for the suggestion ! we used a lab to test for lead . i am sure you could do the same with food samples , but it may be more expensive . i honestly don ’ t know the efficacy of home test kits . good ol ’ google helped . i found this consumer reports article on lead test kits . maybe that ’ s a start ? i ’ m not even sure these test for food and the levels of detection are much higher ( like 2,000 parts per million ) than ours ( 0.01 ppm ) . of course , not buying foods from china eliminates the concern . let me know if you find other test kits ? hopefully others here can give us suggestions . - - -
PLAIN-3431	omnivore vs. vegan nutrient deficiencies there is some bad news though , for those trying to eat healthy . dietary intake studies have shown that vegans , on average , are not getting the recommended daily intake of three nutrients , calcium , iodine and vitamin b12 . using the same criteria though , omnivores are deficient in seven nutrients , calcium , iodine and five others . still the epic study found this year that vegans not getting enough calcium have increased bone fracture risk . those getting enough , 600 milligrams a day were fine , but you know it 's not enough to just understand intellectually that plant based sources of nutrients are superior . we need to put it into practice . the calcium in kale and broccoli is absorbed nearly twice as well as the calcium in milk but we cut our absorption down to zero if we let our greens rot in the fridge or we never buy them in the first place . it would be nice if we could somehow absorb the nutrients in fruits and veggies just by staring at them in the produce aisle but no , we actually have to eat them . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the other videos on omnivores . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! dr. greger , is there a study cited for the deficiencies mentioned at the beginning of the video ? i ’ m also trying to locate the source of the study referenced at the beginning of the video ( i.e. regarding the different deficiencies in the different diets ; do you have a reference for that handy , dr. greger ? i see that there is other activity in this forum from the nf team , so i thought i might re-ping on this issue . i ’ ve been including a link to this video in many of my activism efforts supporting a plant based lifestyle , and i ’ m occasionally questioned on the source of this study ( i.e. regarding the different deficiencies in the different diets ) . i ’ ve tried to discover it on my own , but have been unsuccessful.throw me a vegan-bone here ? = o ) this study brings up the folate , still looking for the others. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2933506 / update : based on uv ’ s very useful prompting further down in this thread , i found the source for this video using a web archive utility ( since the original source is gonzo ) . enjoy : http : / / web.archive.org / web / 20041017010055 / http : / / www.veganmd.org / september2003.html = o ) where is the study showing the nutrient deficiencies in the omnivores ? i dont doubt they have it as of what they don ’ t eat but i am trying to gather data in my own personal collection.do you have any study on lacto vegetarianism and nutrient deficiencies this is one of my favorite videos . the part that is most interesting is the comparison of vegan deficiencies to omnivore . like the others , i too am interested in a citation for the study showing the comparative deficiencies of the different diets . i ’ m posting here so that i will get an e-mail when the “ sources cited ” section is added to . thanks ! how can we get enough calcium in our diet apart from consuming fortified soy milk ? if you are eating lots of greens and beans you will be getting plenty of calcium.i eat a lot of beans and lentils , sometimes cooked from scratch , but often from canned . i noticed on the side of the cans for different brands of beans it says that a serving is only 4 % or 6 % of the rda of calcium . i love beans , but not even i could eat enough to get to 100 % . i don ’ t understand the disconnect between the message , which i have heard for years , that beans are high in calcium and the label , which indicates that they are not . some peg the rda as low as 2 % . any insight into this discrepancy ? the rda for calcium is set quite high , at 1000 mg . if we achieve 600 mg we will have plenty of calcium and even less then these amounts , between 300-500 will be fine . no matter how much calcium you eat , osteoporosis prevention is highly dependent upon exercise , low sodium intake , low animal protein and adequate vitamin d and k levels . “ under the extreme condition of immobilization , rapid bone loss occurs despite consumption of 1,000 mg ( 25 mmol ) / day of calcium ” http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 5776 & page = 74with this in mind , we can boost the rda for our own needs . we can double the percentages . so although a cup of black beans may only have 5 % of the usda assigned rda , it will have 10 % of our rda . a cup of cooked kidney beans will have 24 % of our rda , a cup of cooked collards will have 52 % of our rda . if one consumes a high salt , high animal protein diet then these calcium rda levels should be increased because the body now requires more calcium.http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / legumes-and-legume-products / 4300 / 2 http : / / nutritiondata.self.com / facts / vegetables-and-vegetable-products / 2411 / 2meat and diary tends to leech nutrients off your bones . if you look at nutritional values of veggies you see almost all have some of it . and since you consume mostly veggies in your diet you get enough . meat has way too much protein for our body to process it . want more info read everything by dr barnard or dr campbell . they described all kind of researches involving nutritiondr . gregor has a video with some recent studies that challenge that theory . plenty of other reasons , though , to avoid meat and dairy.are we anatomically and physiologically omnivores or herbivores ? hi roy , we are herbivores designed as hind gut fermenters who differ from the great apes in two respects … we have about 4x the volume in our small intestines to aid the intake of starches and we have 3-9x the amount of amylase genes to aid the digestion of starches . animals who digest plants need adaptions to their intestines as it is harder to digest plants .. they are longer and either modify the fore gut with more than one stomach or the hind gut with modified caecum and / or colon as we have . of course all of our other anatomical features are consistent with non hunters from our jaws and teeth to the location of our sexual organs … have you ever seen a predator with the sexual organs in the front of their bodies ? be well.are humans designed to eat meat ? http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = sh-hs2v-ujihi i am from australia and i am studying the “ healths benefits of a vegan diet for teenagers ” for my year 12 research project and struggling to find information . i was wondering if you could help me out please.scour this site . it has hundreds of videos with hundreds of sources cited.i have looked but cant find any useful ones if you have any useful ones that would great if you could tell me themperhaps you could try typing mood or acne in the search box above ; - ) google anything by neal barnard , pcrm.org , dro campbell . if you can get their books it will be great . will help you a lot. from there you can find different resourcesi have heard that vegans are also deficient in vitamin a. is that true and if so what is the best supplement ? dr.greger , what about this info though ? dr.mcdougall : as long ago as 1978 paterson wrote in the postgraduate medical journal , “ many official bodies give advice on desirable intakes of calcium but no clear evidence of a calcium deficiency disease in otherwise normal people has ever been given . in western countries the usual calcium intake is of the order of 800-1000 mg / day ; in many developing countries figures of 300-500 mg / day are found . there is no evidence that people with such a low intake have any problems with bones or teeth . it seems likely that normal people can adapt to have a normal calcium balance on calcium intakes as low as 150-200 mg / day and that this adaptation is sufficient even in pregnancy and lactation.dr. greger , i am looking for information from scholarly journals on the topic of : “ are vegan diets safe for children . i am not finding much of anything that says yes or no . could you please assist me in finding some journals or where i might look for something other than abstract that i do not have to purchase to get this information ? i need 6 journals , ( 3-pro 3-con ) . thank you for your assistance.dr. greger , thank you for this wonderful site ! i ’ m enjoying doing diligent research for how best to feed my 7month old and our new family : - ) i wish her pediatrician was more knowledgable about plant based nutrition . how do i respond to his concern that there isn ’ t enough bioavailability of vitamins / nutrients in plants to meet her needs ? he specifically mentioned d ( she takes d drops ) , iron and vitamin k. he admitted that we probably know more about this than he does ( ha ! ) but seemed adamant that she would need powdered supplements ? he wants to do regular blood work to check her levels . how do i best address his concerns and sound like i know what i ’ m talking about ? sopranonatasha : i recommend taking a look at the following page . this page is from vrg , the vegetarian research group . vrg is well-respected and well-researched . at the bottom of pages from the articles references in the page below , are references to the original research.i have only looked at , feeding vegan kids . it was super-good and i highly recommend it . the other articles may also be good.https : / / www.vrg.org / family / i hope this helps.thank you , thea ! this is a great video to refer people too when they go on about how becoming vegan is so dangerous . however , i , like many others would like to know the source of this study as google is being no help . ( why does my comment disappear ? ) the reason this is stupid is that people often use a health conscious vegan , then some fat sack that eats mcdonalds . for 1 . that meat sucks and has a bunch of fillers in it . for 2 . they eat a bunch of processed garbage. for 3. they don ’ t do anything for their health at all . then you have the balls to turn around and talk trash about being an omnivore , and yet , they ’ re deficient in areas where plant eaters are not ? that doesn ’ t even make sense because if they were truly omnivores they ’ d be eating vegetables and fruits they ’ d have all the vitamins that a vegan does plus everything they need from meat . the problem isn ’ t “ meat ” the problem is you ’ re entire universe for this study is trash and you ’ re not isolating the variables . it ’ s a joke.dillon : re : “ … plus everything they need from meat . ” even the conservative ada has acknowledged that humans do not need to get any nutrients from meat : “ it is the position of the american dietetic association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets , including total vegetarian or vegan diets , are healthful , nutritionally adequate , and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases . well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle , including pregnancy , lactation , infancy , childhood , and adolescence , and for athletes . ” what this means is that we can get all of our nutrients from plant foods without all of the drawbacks of eating meat . many of those drawbacks exist regardless of where one buys the meat , how it was cooked , or how the animal was raised . this is just one study . this site , however , highlights many , many studies in the context of the “ body of scientific evidence . ” and the body of evidence shows why this study , among others , are relevant and meat intake is not so good for us.you can i can definitely agree on your second point – that people eat too much processed food . but we have enough evidence now to show that processed food is not the only problem with the american diet.good luck . * first off , this is not personal , i don ’ t hate you or think any less of you or anything in that matter ; just the facts as best as i can do . * lets see what i can do with this . first lets get this clear . my topic : 1 ) the study compares vegans to people who eat any old garbage . then pick out meat as the issue with the “ any-old-garbage ” eater . the universe of the study is flawed . then ( and biggest of all ) 2 ) they are obviously not looking at omnivores because if they were the people who also include meat would * not * be “ deficient ” in anything that the vegans have , because he or she is also eating vegetables . — — — - so , you make the claim that the ada says human ’ s don ’ t need to get any nutrients from meat . well , i have a quote from ted.com from the ada that disproves this claim handily : “ but you ’ ll have to educate yourself about how to each various combinations of plant proteins to ensure you receive the essential vitamins like meat has . “ — it seems that the ada believes meat has “ essential vitamins . ” source [ http : / / www.ted.com / conversations / 3291 / if _ human _ can _ live _ healthier _ by.html ] — a little anecdote from me : in every 5 minute google search i ’ ve ever conducted there are numerous sites and scientific journals and studies with the funding displayed as well ( no claiming it ’ s the evil meat and dairy industry ) that proves vegan myths wrong . i ’ m not on my home computer , but if you ’ re interested i can send them to you when i get home . meat is not bad , you can ’ t ever make it bad no matter how much you want it to be . your precious ada even claimed it contains essential nutrients , so that is basically wrapped up ? i don ’ t see how we can continue this conversation.dillon : the idea that plants have to be combined to make complete proteins is a long disproven myth . here is some more information if you are interested : http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmlted talks can be very interesting , but are not scientific evidence in and of themselves . ( and are not vetted in a way that i would take my nutrition advice from . ) and neither is a google search . ( re : ” in every 5 minute google search i ’ ve ever conducted … that proves vegan myths wrong . ” ) as i ’ m sure you know , anything can be repeated again and again on the internet and be completely wrong . there are plenty of examples of that . something to think about . and as nutritionfacts.org shows , with the evidence to back it up , the body of scientific evidence points to a whole plant food based diet as being the healthiest / best chance of preventing the major diseases of our time.i can see that you are happy with your current beliefs and did not find my post helpful . so , as you say , we will leave it at that . good luck.stop ; you have made the first dodge . “ dillon : the idea that plants have to be combined to make complete proteins is a long disproven myth . ” i never made this claim . this “ point ” is moot.i will only go on a point by point basis with you , since you have shown a tendency to evade and shot gun your posts with fallacies and distractions such as this “ protein myth ” i never mentioned . — - this is extremely frustrating to me . i did not use ted talks as scientific evidence either . this is another distraction . we ’ re up to 2 now. because you do ’ nt want to admit to being wrong . your ego can ’ t handle it . you need to buckle down and argue this one single point . — > * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * the ada said that meat is essentiali used a quote from the ada from the ted website . the same company you used to justify your false point that meat is not essential . the ada says that it is . point proven . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * http : / / www.ted.com / conversations / 3291 / if _ human _ can _ live _ healthier _ by.html this can not be ignored . you will answer this . period . we will discuss nothing further until you answer it . now i wait.dillon , there is no need to become so aggressive . also the ada makes no such claim , “ it is the position of the american dietetic association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets , including total vegetarian or vegan diets , are healthful , nutritionally adequate , and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases . well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle , including pregnancy , lactation , infancy , childhood , and adolescence , and for athletes . ” http : / / www.vrg.org / nutrition / 2009 _ ada _ position _ paper.pdf “ appropriately planned ” is a key statement here . they go on to mention possible nutrient deficiencies , but as long as one is appropriately planned , the only possible deficiency is vitamin b12 , which of course is supplemented.to your points in the last post , the standard american diet is an omnivorous diet , but that doesnt mean the quality of their diet is equivalent , just take a look at what percent of the population is deficient in certain vegetables below. http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / early / 2010 / 08 / 11 / jn.110.124826.full.pdfabout 80 % do not get enough fruits , 88 % do not get enough vegetables , about 99 % do not consume enough whole grains . and keep in mind these are in line with the bare minimum guidelines for food intakes for americans which are far too low to begin with and do not actually prevent chronic disease . lack of plant food consumption is a nationwide health problem. http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / early / 2010 / 08 / 11 / jn.110.124826.full.pdfthe guidelines do not appear to significantly prevent chronic disease risk when evaluated using the healthy eating index developed by the usda . women are unprotected from all forms of chronic disease while men have a 28 % reduced risk of heart disease. http : / / apjcn.nhri.org.tw / server / apjcn / 17 / s1 / 75.pdffurthermore , most people consuming an omnivorous diet displace their calories to consume copious amounts of animal products and saturated fats . the healthful vegan diet and current diet consumed by most americans today is not at all comparable , and based on the mass amount of evidence available , shows that a vegan diet can essentially reverse chronic disease , which even the “ healthiest ” standard american diet cannot.to be fair though ; over 40 % of the us population aren ’ t getting enough vitamin b12 as of 2000 and even conservative governments like the usda appears to recognize this.http : / / www.ars.usda.gov / is / pr / 2000 / 000802.htmhi dr greger . it ’ s great to see an actual doctor setting up a site like this . with real science ! a quick google search shows a whole stalk of broccoli will cover only 11 % of my dv . is this really viable ? or is a calcium supplement a better option ? calcium needs for humans are not as high as the dri may recommend , and if we consumed a low sodium diet low in animal protein , our calcium needs can be as low as 450 mg per day as discussed more extensively in this article from the food and agriculture organization of the un . as represented in the figure below , and citing from the article “ in a western-style diet , absorbed calcium matches urinary and skin calcium at an intake of 840 mg as in figure 14 . reducing animal protein intakes by 40 g reduces the intercept [ calcium balance ] value and requirement to 600 mg . reducing both sodium and protein reduces the intercept value to 450 mg . ” http : / / www.fao.org / docrep / 004 / y2809e / y2809e0h.htm # bm17so with 450-600 mg of calcium as a goal , msot plant foods over the course of a day will satisfy this . eating leafy greens and beans will provide a higher amount of calcium as well . try it out and put your daily nutrition info into https : / / cronometer.com / this is great news ( and again , real science ! ) i don ’ t eat meat so that ’ s good news and good to know a bit more about how high sodium can affect the body . i watched another video on here about vegan buddist nuns and that was a good indicator that low ( er ) calcium diet does not necessarily mean calcium deficiency.thanks for the app looks really cool might try it out ! i ’ m pretty proud of my broad leafy and legume intake , it could be fun to data log it ! make sure you get 15-20 min of direct sunlight daily for vit d. many researches showed vit supplements may harm you more than help . your body is able to make enough nutrients it needs to function properly from plant based diet . every person is different so for what you may need 150 mg someone else may need more . only way to know is to run periodical blood tests on all your vitamins . they one that you may be deficient is the one you have to concentrate of finding veggies with proper vitamins . eat tons of greens collards , swiss chard or anything else you like and you are good.grass-fed meat and wild seafood are nutrient dense super foods that are superior to grain-fed factory farmed meat . grains are very toxic to cattle . grains are poorly nutritious relative to organic meat and vegetables . there ’ s no good reason to eat them as well as dairy and legumes . vegetables , meat and tubers should account for most of your macros . the optimal ratio differs from person to person . healthy fats , nuts , seeds and fruit should generally be in moderation.have you heard about recent tsunami in japan just few years ago ? since than all the ocean is highly contaminated with radioactive waste . they were testing oceans all over the world and all seafood is contaminated with that crap . also meat and fish are saturated fat which are bad for us . also our body does not absorb nutrition from meet as well as veggies . read anything by dr campbell or dr barnard for more infoi ’ m vegan and got hypothyroidism i think . i think iodine is the only micronutrient i ’ m deficient in . i just would prefer to not have to take supplements if i don ’ t have to . i ’ d rather get them from whole foods . any advice ?

PLAIN-3441	doctors ' nutritional ignorance the world health organization blames literally millions of deaths every year on inadequate fruit and vegetable intake . almost as deadly as smoking . so if we care enough about ourselves and our families to not want to die a horrific death from smoking , we should put the same effort into eating more fruits and vegetables . we should eat fruits and vegetables as if our lives depended on it , because in a way they do . why haven 't many of us heard of this change from 5 a day to 9 a day ? well , the federal government spends about 10 million a year to educate people about healthy eating . candy corporations spend about twice that amount just launching a new candy bar . okay but , why don 't most doctors pass this information along ? because odds are your doctor never learned any of this . less than a quarter of medical schools have even a single dedicated course on nutrition , and less than 6 % of graduating physicians may have received any formal nutrition training . out of thousands of hours of pre clinical instruction your doctor may have gotten an average of three hours of nutrition training . there was even a study published in the american journal of clinical nutrition that pitted doctors versus patients in a head to head test of basic nutrition knowledge , simple true or false questions . guess who won ? the patients . people off the street knew more about nutrition than their doctors , yet people still ask their doctors for nutrition advice . what doctors may be telling their patients to eat may be killing them . it wasn 't too long ago that doctors were advising pregnant women to smoke cigarettes to help with morning sickness . until doctors are taught more about nutrition their advising us about diet may be physician-assisted suicide . there is one doctor though , everyone trusts . perhaps the most famous physician of all time . dr benjamin spock . always on the forefront of important social issues . and in the final edition of his book , the best selling book in american history ( second only to the bible ) , he recommended that all children be raised on meat and dairy free diets to prevent diseases like cancer . please feel free to post any ask-the-doctor type questions here in the comments section and i ’ d be happy to try to answer them . and check out the update on doctors ’ nutrition knowledge . also , there are 1,449 other subjects covered in the rest of my videos – please feel free to explore them as well ! this is so true ! my boyfriend ’ s 38 year old harvard medical schooled internist had never heard of the china study ! wow , this is something i have become acutely aware of in the last year . now the biggest challenge i have is finding firing my current doctor and finding a physician who is well educated in both naturopathic and allopathic treatments , and will provide me with my preferred method of naturopathic nutritional advice ! also be sure to check out my associated blog post cow ’ s milk casomorphin , crib death , and autism ! is it ok to consume meat products that have zero animal fat in it ?

its because some big corporation want to make back their money spent on years of research by trying to make a synthetic version of it for sale.so , since you know it now you can help a friend in need by letting him know or just drink some sour sop juice yourself as prevention from time to time . the taste is not bad after all . it ’ s completely natural and definitely has no side effects . if you have the space , plant one in your garden . the other parts of the tree are also useful.the next time you have a fruit juice , ask for a sour sop.how many people died in vain while this billion-dollar drug maker concealed the secret of the miraculous graviola tree ? this tree is low and is called graviola ! in brazi l , guanabana in spanish and has the uninspiring name “ soursop ” in english . the fruit is very large and the subacid sweet white pulp is eaten out of hand or , more commonly , used to make fruit drinks , sherbets and such.the principal interest in this plant is because of its strong anti-cancer effects . although it is effective for a number of medical conditions , it is its anti tumor effect that is of most interest . this plant is a proven cancer remedy for cancers of all types.besides being a cancer remedy , graviola is a broad spectrum antimicrobial agent for both bacterial and fungal infections , is effective against internal parasites and worms , lowers high blood pressure and is used for depression , stress and nervous disorders.if there ever was a single example that makes it dramatically clear why the existence of health sciences institute is so vital to americans like you , it ’ s the incredible story behind the graviola tree .. the truth is stunningly simple : deep within the amazon rainforest grows a tree that could literally revolutionize what you , your doctor , and the rest of the world thinks about cancer treatment and chances of survival . the future has never looked more promising.research shows that with extracts from this miraculous tree it now may be possible to : * attack cancer safely and effectively with an all-natural therapy that does not cause extreme nausea , weight loss and hair loss * protect your immune system and avoid deadly infections * feel stronger and healthier throughout the course of the treatment * boost your energy and improve your outlook on lifethe source of this information is just as stunning : it comes from one of america ‘ s largest drug manufacturers , the fruit of over 20 laboratory tests conducted since the 1970 ’ s ! what those tests revealed was nothing short of mind numbing … extracts from the tree were shown to : * effectively target and kill malignant cells in 12 types of cancer , including colon , breast , prostate , lung and pancreatic cancer .. * the tree compounds proved to be up to 10,000 times stronger in slowing the growth of cancer cells than adriamycin , a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug ! * what ’ s more , unlike chemotherapy , the compound extracted from the graviola tree selectively hunts down and kills only cancer cells .. it does not harm healthy cells ! the amazing anti-cancer properties of the graviola tree have been extensively researched – so why haven ’ t you heard anything about it ? if graviola extract isone of america ‘ s biggest billion-dollar drug makers began a search for a cancer cure and their research centered on graviola , a legendary healing tree from the amazon rainforest.various parts of the graviola tree – including the bark , leaves , roots , fruit and fruit-seeds – have been used for centuries by medicine men and native indi ! ans in s outh america to treat heart disease , asthma , liver problems and arthritis . going on very little documented scientific evidence , the company poured money and resources into testing the tree ’ s anti-cancerous properties – and were shocked by the results . graviola proved itself to be a cancer-killing dynamo . but that ’ s where the graviola story nearly ended.the company had one huge problem with the graviola tree – it ’ s completely natural , and so , under federal law , not patentable . there ’ s no way to make serious profits from it.it turns out the drug company invested nearly seven years trying to synthesize two of the graviola tree ’ s most powerful anti-cancer ingredients . if they could isolate and produce man-made clones of what makes the graviola so potent , they ’ d be able to patent it and make their money back . alas , they hit a brick wall . the original simply could not be replicated . there was no way the company could protect its profits – or even make back the millions it poured into research.as the dream of huge profits evaporated , their testing on graviola came to a screeching halt . even worse , the company shelved the entire project and chose not to publish the findings of its research ! luckily , however , there was one scientist from the graviola research team whose conscience wouldn ’ t let him see such atrocity committed . risking his career , he contacted a company that ’ s dedicated to harvesting medical plants from the amazon rainforest and blew the whistle.miracle unleashed when researchers at the health sciences institute were alerted to the news of graviola , ! they be gan tracking the research done on the cancer-killing tree . evidence of the astounding effectiveness of graviola – and its shocking cover-up – came in fast and furious … . … .the national cancer institute performed the first scientific research in 1976 . the results showed that graviola ’ s “ leaves and stems were found effective in attacking and destroying malignant cells . ” inexplicably , the results were published in an internal report and never released to the public … … .since 1976 , graviola has proven to be an immensely potent cancer killer in 20 independent laboratory tests , yet no double-blind clinical trials – the typical benchmark mainstream doctors and journals use to judge a treatment ’ s value – were ever initiated … . … .a study published in the journal of natural products , following a recent study conducted at catholic university of south korea stated that one chemical in graviola was found to selectively kill colon cancer cells at “ 10,000 times the potency of ( the commonly used chemotherapy drug ) adriamycin … ” … .the most significant part of the catholic university of south korea report is that graviola was shown to selectively target the cancer cells , leaving healthy cells untouched . unlike chemotherapy , which indiscriminately targets all actively reproducing cells ( such as stomach and hair cells ) , causing the often devastating side effects of nausea and hair loss in cancer patients . … a study at purdue university recently found that leaves from the graviola tree killed cancer cells among six human cell lines and were especially effective against prostate , pancreatic and lung cancers seven years of silence broken – it ’ s finally here ! ! ! = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = a cursory search of the internet seems to indicate that there is at least some truth to some of the above claims . * http : / / www.webmd.com / vitamins-supplements / ingredientmono-1054-graviola.aspx ?

PLAIN-3451	blue-green algae & spirulina i 'd also recommend staying away from the tiny dark green leafies , blue-green algae and spirulina . this story starts in guam where the chamorro people were eating perhaps the world 's cutest bat , the flying fox . that was a mistake since it turns out the flying fox 's favorite fruit is from this funky looking tree who 's watery roots concentrate a toxin produced by some rare algae . the result was that the chamorro started dying of something called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis parkinsonism dementia , basically a combination of parkinsons , alzheimers and lou gehrig 's disease . we used to think neurotoxins were limited to rare exotic algae but now we know otherwise . we now know that almost all blue-green algae can produce neurotoxins like bmaa . turns out the only places one is likely to find bmaa is in the brains of alzheimers patients and at the local all natural food store in the form of blue-green algae . so , until we know more , i recommend leaving that particular product out of your cart . and this , spirulina the other pond scum . well , it 's good for our blood pressure , our cholesterol and seems to work wonders against seasonal allergies but spirulina may dissolve our muscles from the inside out . it 's always better when our food doesn 't kill us . not all species of cyanobacteria are poisonous . spirulina ( arthrospira maxima e a. platensis ) doesn ’ t seem to be dangerous to humans as i ’ ve been researching lately . however , the real risk lies when spirulina is bought from a suspicious / shady source – the consumer may receive a toxic blue-green algae instead.thank you for your comment herman . the synthesis of some of these toxins does not appear to be species-specific . there certainly are toxic types of algae , but even what ’ s sold in health foods stores as blue-green algae and spirulina may idiosyncratically produce certain toxins ( that ’ s why every batch would have to be tested , which is cost-prohibitive ) . please see my other blue-green algae and spirulina videos for more background.thanks for the heads up , dr. greger ! i ’ ll send the links to your videos to my dietitian / nutritionist , as she was the one that suggested that i should take both spirulina and chlorella . thanks again ! what about organic spirulina ? toxins or not ? ? is every batch tested or is it safe because it is organic ? what exactly does organic mean in this context ? producing billions and billions of microscopic organisms might be the one area where you actually prefer less organic.oh , oh . out goes the spirulina / bg algae . thanks for the heads up . i bought it and haven ’ t used it so much . i am more interested in natural fruits and vegis . who knows what we ’ ll find in those next . ha ! glad to hear you ’ ve taken such an interest ! for more on spirulina and blue green algae , check out these videos. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / update-on-spirulina / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / update-on-spirulina-2 / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / update-on-chlorella / and also be sure to check out some other harmful “ exotic ” fruits. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-mangosteen-juice-good-for-you / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / are-star-fruit-good-for-you / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / videos / is-noni-juice-good-for-you / enjoy ! thank you for the info . i had recently read that spirulina had a protective action on cardiac muscle in chemo patients ( as chemo can damage cardiac tissue ) . have you ever heard that claim ?

are those safe ? my husband ’ s mother and grandfather both suffered from alzheimers and i want to make sure i ’ m not giving him anything that may increase his risk . thanks ! yes , algae derived omega 3 is safe. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / plant-based-omega-3-supplements-2 / do you know of any evidence for dietary factors in the development or progression of als , lou gehrig ’ s / motor neuron disease ? perhaps you could recommend a reliable brand or store for spirulina ? try a couple of spirulina products and test its toxicity . i am interested in taking it as protein supplement and i need to be sure of my source just in case.what about organic spirulina ? hepatic toxins or not ? ? are organic batches tested and found to create these toxins ? , or is it safer and nontoxic producing due to it being organic ? i recently read that fish acquire their dha and epa omega 3 ’ s from eating algae . if that is the case , then what is the difference between eating fish and the bats ? i have introduced a mixture of organic spirulina , cod liver oil and fresh local yogurt. as well as no flush niacin caplets to my 55 % uncooked vegtable diet . i am not a vegitarian but have noticed an increase in water consumption and energy during the day . while lowering my meat intake . the effects on my body from my mixture is nothing short of amazing . more lean muscle mass with less water retention coupled with lightning fast muscle recovery time . for me , protein shakes are useless . i see absolutely no reason not to implement this in a regular diet . we all might see an epidemic of health . i dont see my health care as a pill for every ill.well , i see someone watched foodmatters … do you know anything about biosuperfood ? this is my main supplement but now i ’ m questioning it . the ingredients are listed here : http : / / www.bioage.com / ingredients.html.you must have read my mind . a friend posted this article last night , worried about brooks . that got me wondering about the fancy blue-green algae i use about once a month in juices and smoothies . no wonder my body doesn ’ t want it very often.http : / / www.times-standard.com / breakingnews / ci _ 23733429would fermenting spirulina inactivate potentially harmful properties ? dr. greger , i started taking spirulina when i read a number of research papers claiming that spirulina heals scars . i had had major surgery and was left with a nasty scar , yet , after taking spirulina for less then six months the scare is 90 % gone . the hardness or scare tissue is no longer there . how can something that is so bad do so much good ? that is just one of some of the good i have encountered using spirulina . thanks ! jo-annhow about growing your own spirulina at home ? wouldn ’ t it be safe and bacteria free if done correctly ? spirulina is a bacteria . growing your own at home won ’ t make a difference in “ safer ” spirulina because cyanobacteria simply just produce this amino acid.hello i started to consume spirulina and chlorella postnatal iron deficiency and fatigue i ’ m breastfeeding and told me it was okay for me and the baby . now tell me that it is full of heavy metals and toxins .. i have nothing to fear i was nursing my son ? and the collection myself ? i had the these symptoms : headache and muscle pain please tell me whether i need to stop . really makes me feel bad that i took it to improve your health and it does the opposite ? i ’ d love a quick answer please i ’ m very worried about me son.thank youi have been taking super blue green algae tablets for almost 20 years and i give the powder to my pets. put it in my babies bottles with juice as well , love it , fb me for the amazing brand that i use.i use e3 live do you think this is also bad ? what about wheat grass ? wheatgrass isn ’ t a cyanobacteria , no bmaa to worry about there . as far as e3live , afa may contain small amounts of bmaa but until we see several studies proving otherwise , we don ’ t quite know.thank you . i have been taking spirulina and blue algae for several years . at first i found it gave me energy but in the last two years i have become increasing lethargic , forgetful and reduced immune system , catching colds and suffering from sinusitis . i also developed bells palsy during this period . could it all be related ? i have just thrown my tablets in the bin.there are articles that the superfood spirulina causes decrease in bone mineral density despite its many benefits ( including for the various minerals in spirulina which are essential for calcium absorption and strong bones ) .hence , is spirulina safe for intake by women with surgical menopause and diagnosed with osteoporosis ? appeciate your thoughts on this.dr. greger strongly advises against the use of spirulina for various reasons . please see the videos here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / topics / spirulina / i take klamath blue green algae sold at a whole foods store . i believe it helps my anxiety although it could just be a placebo affect i am not sure . i do not want to be taking this if it could potentially be toxic : / / i have been taking it since october so that ’ s 4 months now , i take one pill a day . if anyone has advice i would kindly appreciate it thank you . i am 22 years old ! ! my mother has als . doctors state there is no cure . based upon experience can i at least halt the disease from progressing ? we are willing to try anything at this point.in my opinion , the following may help : in addition to regularly taking 20g daily of 3rd party tested spirulina , avoid all carbs especially sugar and wheat products , avoid all polyunsaturated oils ( sunflower , saflower , soya , sesame , etc ) , avoid alcohol , avoid fructose ( also in fruits ) , take a tsp of organic coconut oil and pasture raised butter every 4 hrs , take krill oil , take astaxanthin , take cottage cheese smoothied with linseed oil and red onion and garlic , take 4 raw orgainic eggs daily smoothied with an organic tomatoe and a carrot and a paprika and spirulina , take msm , take overcooked green tea daily ( must taste bitter , eat the leaves too ) , eat different types of organic cheese , but avoid milk , eat lot of herbs and spices.also take daily coenzyme q10 as well as fermented cod liver oilmake sure that the astaxanthin and coenzyme q10 are not dissolved in hardened vegetable oilsavoid margerine and all other hardened vegetable oilsavoid processed white salt , use himalyan salt insteadyour comments are far too vague to really say anything meaningful . here you have the “ tiny dark green leafies ” , then a bigger green plant , which you do not name as bat food , and then some dead chamorro people from bmaa . where do the alzheimer ’ s patients get their bmaa from ?

PLAIN-3461	coffee and mortality do coffee-drinkers live longer than non-coffee drinkers ? is it , “ wake up and smell the coffee ” , or “ don ’ t wake up at all ? ” the largest study ever conducted on diet and health put that question to the test , examining the association between coffee drinking with subsequent mortality among hundreds of thousands of older men and women in the united states . coffee drinkers won , though the effect was modest . 10 to 15 % lower risk of death for those drinking six or more cups a day , due specifically to lower risk of dying from heart disease , respiratory disease , stroke , injuries and accidents , diabetes , and infections.that much coffee was found to increase the death rate of younger people , though , under age 55 . hence , based on this study , it may be appropriate to recommend that you avoid drinking more than four cups a day . but , if you put all the studies together , the bottom line is that coffee consumption is associated with no change or a small reduction in mortality starting around one or two cups a day , for both men , and women.on a cup by cup basis , the risk of dying was 3 % lower for each cup of coffee consumed daily , which provides reassurance with respect to the concern that coffee drinking might adversely affect health.well , at least , longevity . healthwise though , a recent population study found no link between coffee consumption and symptoms of gerd , such as heartburn and regurgitation , if you actually stick a tube down people ’ s throats and measure ph , coffee induces significant acid reflux , whereas tea , does not . is it just because tea has less caffeine ? no . if you reduce the caffeine content of the coffee down to that of tea , it still causes significantly more acid reflux . decaf caused less , so gerd patients might want to choose decaffeinated or even better , drink tea.coffee intake is also associated with urinary incontinence , and so a decrease in caffeine intake should be discussed with women who have the condition , or men . about two cups of coffee a day worth of caffeine may worsen urinary leakage in men as well.a 2014 meta-analysis suggested that daily coffee consumption was associated with a slightly increased risk of bone fractures in women , but a decreased risk of fractures in men . not hip fractures , though . no significant association was found between coffee consumption and the risk of hip fracture , though tea consumption may actually be protective against hip fracture , though it appears to have no apparent relationship with fracture risk in general.there are certain populations in particular that may want to stay away from caffeine , for example , those with glaucoma , and possibly even those with a family history of glaucoma.goes without saying that people who have trouble sleeping might not want to imbibe . even just a single cup at night can cause a significant deterioration in sleep quality . then , there are case reports , for example , of individuals with epilepsy having fewer seizures after stopping coffee ; so , i guess it ’ s worth a shot . we used to think caffeine might increase the risk of an irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation , but that too , was based on anecdotal case reports like this one of a young woman who suffered atrial fibrillation after chocolate intake abuse . but these cases invariably involved the acute ingestion of very large quantities of caffeine . as a result , though , the notion that caffeine ingestion may trigger abnormal heart rhythms had become quote-unquote ” common knowledge , ” and this assumption led to changes in medical practice . more recently , however , the pendulum has swung in the other direction . why ? because , we actually have data now : caffeine does not increase the risk of atrial fibrillation . and low-dose caffeine , which they define as less than about five cups of coffee a day , may even have a protective effect . however , given the proliferation of energy drinks that contain massive quantities , one might temper any message that suggests that caffeine is beneficial . seems a little patronizing , but it ’ s no joke . twelve highly caffeinated energy drinks within a few hours could be lethal . now how are we defining “ cup ” ? because the “ old standard ” measure for a cup of joe is not 8 oz . it is 6 . and here in america i buy a “ small ” “ cup of coffee ” served commercially and it is usually 12-18 ounces . so two “ cups ” of that is actually four or six actual “ cups of coffee ” in the classic measure . maybe we nail down a measurement for a bit more accurate comparisons ? thanksnutrition without calories this coffee and tea ! “ energy drinks ” great example of how our food industry markets things . we all know what we are referring to when anyone uses the term “ energy drink ” but i like to remind folks that there is no energy without calories . that those are in-fact , stimulant drinks.oh , that ’ s easy . a cup coffee is a double shot of espresso made from freshly roasted aa kenya coffee beans.a “ cup ” of coffee is 6 ounces of water , but ~ 5 ounces of brewed coffee , since the grounds hold onto quite a bit of the water . but if you asked most people what size a cup of coffee is , they would say it is the amount of coffee that will fit into their cup they use for coffee and probably give you a funny look for asking such a dumb question.when i used to stop at the local gas-and-crap food convenience store on my way to work , all the sizes of coffee were the same price ! so being a cheap engineer , my optimizer program immediately guided my hand to the 20 oz size . i must have not been the only one to make that same choice because the 20 oz cup slot was always running low on cups and the rest were always full . i would even sometimes around 10 or so get another “ cup ” of coffee from the coffee club pot at work . of course my office coffee “ cup ” also did wonderful duty as a soup bowl when i needed to heat my lunch in the microwave . then when i couldn ’ t get to sleep at night i could never figure out why . it couldn ’ t be coffee since i only had one maybe two “ cups ” of coffee during the day ! : - ) and just a few weeks ago i found myself a bit tipsy after just three beers . the first one was a quart and the second two were 24 oz. each. hiccup ! i feel so much better after long-term stopping ( more than one year without ) of all caffeine drinks . try life with and without , and see how you feel . all the best.if i start having sleep issues i cut back or quit . i ’ m one of those odd-folks who can quit caffeine and yet function ( have done it more than once ) . but i like my level of moderation now , especially when i ’ m roasting my own beans from places like ethiopia . if the only coffee was the standard american drudge ( sad ) , then yeah-give it up ! over the years i became more and more caffiene sensitive until i was drinking only decaf . one cup of full caffeine coffee in the morning would keep me awake at night . then with the necessity of a plant based diet i began consuming lots of cruciferous veggies . now with ample sulforaphane my liver seems be doing its job and i have no problem sleeping after coffee . indeed i even seem more relaxed.my dad used to get up in the wee hours , have a cup of coffee and go back to sleep ! i can drink it before bed and it never seems to affect me either , but i rarely do . if i drink too much too often , i get headaches when i skip it , which i don ’ t do often either , but still . dependencies suck ! made no difference to me , still doesn ’ t really . i never started drinking coffee until i turned 25 because my so drinks it . i drink it everyday at work now almost , and tea as well , but i don ’ t feel any crazy effect unless i drink a lot . that being said , i don ’ t drink any on the weekends ( unless she makes it sunday morning for us both ) , and i feel absolutely no difference mentally or physically those two days off.what about all that cream and sugar ? that must cancel all the coffee benefits and maybe even make it worse i ’ m sure.any studies on that ? i think this study probably refers to drinking coffee black . i recall another video a while back on benefits of green tea where it was explicitly made clear that the benefits would be cancelled out if it was consumed with tea or sugar.that ’ s great point . there may be a questionnaire about how the subjects drank their coffee . i am sure we could pin it down by digging into the “ sources cited ” section and pulling the articles . i looked at the randomized trial on sleep , which stated ” coffee preparations : the two coffee preparations were either 3 g of regular instant coffee containing 90 mg of caffeine ( nescafé spécial filtre ) , or 3 g of decaffeinated instant coffee containing 4.5 mg of caffeine ( nescafé spécial filtre décaféiné , nestlé , vevey , switzerland ) . the data on the caffeine content was provided by the manufacturer . the two coffee bags were equal in presentation and taste and were prepared in our pharmacy , observing strict quality controls . each coffee bag had to be diluted in warm water ( about 200 ml with or without milk and sugar ) . subjects took one or other types of coffee , in a cross-over sequence defined by a list prepared by a colleague not participating in the study and working in the clinical pharmacology unit . ” the findings were similar , so it appears the milk or sugar didn ’ t seem to matter in that study.gp65 has a good point . cow ’ s milk may negate the healthful effects of green tea , but not plant-based milks.great point . as a dentist i see many adults that consume lots of coffee with added sugar or honey . many of them get lots of cavities from it . i always recommend to my patients that if they ’ re going to drink coffee or tea , don ’ t add any sugar or whiteners ( which invariably contain lots of sugar ) .i feel so relieved to see this . just got back from plant stock with dr. esselstyn and others and he said no caffeine coffee but caffeine tea ok. glad to know i won ’ t drop dead from my caffeine coffee i so love.newsjunkie , what did he mean caffeine tea ok ? dr esselstyn told a small group of us who asked him about caffeine that after a talk with dr. gregor , decaf coffee and caffeinated tea is ok . he did not say caffeinated coffee is ok.did dr. e provide data as dr. g does here ? this video may provide the data you seek : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / coffee-and-artery-function / nice overview dr g. thanks for ‘ stimulating ’ my thinking about coffee this morning . user tip : try watching these videos at 0.5 speed to take in the information . of course , there is also the transcript . thanks nf team.if it weren ’ t for the antioxidants in coffee , many americans would get precious little antioxidants at all : http : / / phys.org / news / 2005-08-coffee-source-antioxidants.html http : / / www.webmd.com / diet / the-buzz-on-coffeeand , since it is likely to come up , i learned something today about ‘ fair-trade ’ coffee that kinda burst my bubble . thought i ’ d pass it on : http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com / bruce-wydick / 10-reasons-fair-trade-coffee-doesnt-work _ b _ 5651663.html.5 speed makes dr g sound like he needs a really big cup of coffee … or a nap.a very heartening report . thank you , dr. greger for the straight scoop.after decaffeinating myself several times over the course of this lifetime and eventually returning to drinking coffee all day , i ’ ve found a happy medium . completely avoiding leaded coffee makes me hyper-sensitive to even the smallest amounts of caffeine ( e.g. a small amount of chocolate ) causing my heart to pound . an unacceptable situation . drinking coffee all day – as i did in my twenties – makes my ( ahem ) more seasoned heart race . equally unacceptable.my goldilocks “ just right ” solution ? one or two cups of regular coffee before ten a.m. and herbal or decaf tea or ( rarely ) decaf coffee after that . no racing . if i have a little chocolate in the evening my body seems sufficiently desensitized to the caffeine so that my sleep is undisturbed . note the word little.in the past 18 months i have given up dairy , meat , fish and almost all oil . chocolate and wine are not on the table.what effect does coffee have on the adrenal glands ? does this lead to increase in adrenal depletion / exhaustion and chronic fatigue ? hi kelly this is a really interesting topic . i hope dr g can cover this . i have patients who see naturopaths and they are told they suffer from adrenal fatigue.adrenal insufficiency is a real medical condition . adrenal fatigue is a pseudoscience sham.i ’ ve got a hunch that the endurance athletes who have suffered from adrenal fatigue all have one thing in common — heavy coffee / caffeine consumption . there have now been several examples of severe adrenal fatigue in the ultrarunning community , including two time western states champion geoff roes.dr. greger mentions the adrenals in these videos . here is an older study “ age and prior caffeine use alter the cardiovascular and adrenomedullary responses to oral caffeine ” showing caffeine ( 2-3 cups of coffee ) did not impact certain hormones . another study found that “ cigarette smoking and coffee consumption were related to high adrenaline excretion rates ” there may be more , but i only found limited human trials . other might have more to add . thanks for posting your questions ! so if i heard that right “ low dose caffeine ” is considered 5 cups or less ? that seems like alot to me even if it ’ s 6oz or 8oz.also the part about energy drinks doesnt make sense . if you look up most caffeine contents on the cans they will give you mg amount from all sources . that includes the guarana , ginseng other stuff . and most of those ( using monster ) are from 140-180 per 16 fluid oz can . not saying they are healthy but i know some coffe drinks and lattes that are much higher than thatwhat does ginseng have to do with caffeine ? sorry mentioned wrong source . yerbayes , the researchers in that study considered low-dose ( less than 500 mg of caffeine ) .good catch about energy drinks , they all vary in size and ingredients . i think the study was just saying if you drink 12 of them in a few hours , and each can has 3 grams of caffeine , that is like 36 grams ( 36,000 mg of caffeine ) which is way to much . it makes 1-2 cups of morning java ( 100-200 mg of caffeine ) look super innocent.i always have the same question after a presentation on coffee . are the results the same for decaf ? i drink about 32 ounces of coffee per day , made from about 15 grams of caffeinated coffee beans and 70 grams of decaf beans . yes , i weigh my coffee beans . is there something in the dsm for that ? i have two questions : 1 . the effects of caffeinated vs decafe coffee ( and tea ) are not sorted out . what is the evidence that caffeine per se is beneficial ? 2 . the discussion of atrial fibrillation states that caffeine does not increase risk of afib , but i was left wondering whether that conclusion refers only to initial incidence or also to subsequent incidence.caffeine functions as adenosine receptor antagonist ( 1 ) , which may account for benefits in neurodenerative diseases ( 2 ) , and it also inhibits mtor ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , nf videos ) , a growth regulatory protein central in aging and cancer research . other compounds in coffee like the melanoidins produced during roasting potently elevate endogenous antioxidant responses and suppress inflammatory ones . ( 7 , 8 ) which may be genoprotective ( 9 ) . for what its worth , i drink 3-4 cups of caffeinated dark roast coffee daily , drip filtered through thick paper to remove the cholesterol elevating cafestol and kahweol.unfortunately , the caffeine & afib meta-analysis excluded three studies of caffeine in patients with preexisting afib , and my scholar-fu isn ’ t up to finding those three . there ’ s study that suggests caffeine may reduce afib vulnerability in a predisposed animal model ( 10 ) , but otherwise the evidence is scarce.thanks very much for the informative reply ! i ’ ll look into the references and videos . i drank lots of caffeinated coffee for about 50 years until my cardiologist told me to quit since i experienced an a-fib occurence , so i drink decafe . i ’ m on the fence about going back to caffeine since i don ’ t want another a-fib event — there ’ s no way i ’ m going on the meds invariably prescribed.i found this 2012 review , which i think you may find useful : recommendations regarding dietary intake and caffeine and alcohol consumption in patients with cardiac arrhythmias : what do you tell your patients to do or not to do ? thanks , i really appreciate it ! from reference [ 64 ] of your review article ( 1 ) above , your coffee intake is most protective against late-life dementia . coincidence ? i think not. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 19158424since many people don ’ t drink enough liquids , could it be that the benefits of coffee drinking are really just from the drinking more liquids ? do the studies compare coffee and tea drinking to water or other liquids ? i ’ m sure the studies control for many variables . you ’ d really have to read each one to see for sure . we have a great “ sources cited ” section by the video where you can pull the studies . let me know if you cannot find something you ’ re looking for.someone asked a similar question about if subjects were adding milk and sugar to the coffee , which i answered about further down in this thread.ok , ok , ok , tell me if you have heard this one before . how do you know if you have been drinking too much coffee ? your doctor tells you that you really need to be getting at least 8 hours of sleep and you think she means a week ! why should those with glaucoma or even a family history of glaucoma stay away from coffee ? hi carol from above . this is the study he is referring to.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3100584 / thanks , veganrunner ! caffeine is not an stimulant . this is how it workshttp : / / www.smithsonianmag.com / ist / ? next = / science-nature / this-is-how-your-brain-becomes-addicted-to-caffeine-26861037 / ‘ when caffeine molecules are blocking those receptors , they prevent this from occurring , thereby generating a sense of alertness and energy for a few hours . additionally , some of the brain ’ s own natural stimulants ( such as dopamine ) work more effectively when the adenosine receptors are blocked , and all the surplus adenosine floating around in the brain cues the adrenal glands to secrete adrenaline , another stimulant.for this reason , caffeine isn ’ t technically a stimulant on its own ” neato . one of the first things that i noticed when i started looking more closely at the effects of various drugs is that for very many of them ( rx and otherwise ) the “ mechanism of action ” isn ’ t known . glad we ’ re making some progress on that front.when i consume too much caffeine my sleep suffers . when i consume way too much caffeine i get acute lower back pain ( presumed to be my kidneys ) . did that three times as a young person . learned not to . that was 30 years ago.starbucks and similar products both burnt and with added ingredients gives me gerd , but the pure coffee my friend produces in costa rica , ground just before making and with a paper filter , does not give me gerd which was a severe problem for me in the past . i once read a paper that indicated coffee made with a paper filter has a better impact on your lipid profile . is this true ? paper filters are supposed to help remove some “ unwanted ” component of coffee , but i forget which . i quit using paper filters long long ago when i switched to the french press . now since reducing my intake i don ’ t even use the press . i just pour the water into the freshly ground ( and often freshly roasted ) beans , steep , and then pour through a strainer into the cup . my gerd was cured by wfpb diet . i was on ppi ’ s every single day for nearly two years . now i ’ m completely off . also someone gifted me a bag of dunkin ’ donuts coffee once . it had an artificial ingredient . i didn ’ t make any of it . even when eating sad , i avoided artificials at every opportunity.sweet maria ’ s for great green beans ( unroasted ) . use an air-popper for roasting for frugality-there ’ s one in every yard sale . lightly roasted african beans are awesome.paper filters remove oily components called diterpenes ; these organic compounds , present in unfiltered coffee are known to be antimicrobial and antiinflammatory . metal or nylon mesh filters do not remove these components . [ 1 https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / coffee _ filteroh i see the problem : from wiki : _ on july 8 , 1908 , the first paper coffee filter was created by german housewife melitta bentz . she wanted to remove the bitter taste caused by boiling loose grounds or using the typical method of linen to brew coffee . [ 2 ] _ boiling the grounds ! i boil the water ( sometimes not even a full boil ) pour it into the grounds and never add heat again unless using the microwave to reheat . this way it never goes “ stale ” in the pot , and there ’ s never any bitterness ( which also comes from oxidized grounds / beans ) .i better go boil some water now.great news for tea drinkers ! coffee seems to make me irritable after about 30 mins – 1 hr , unfortunately , and decaf gives me a severe migraine so that ’ s out as well.as a clinician , although this study proves longevity , i have personally observed the relief my patients have once they are able to break their addiction to coffee . there are a lot of pro and con studies on coffee , but in general , i know through experience that it does more harm than good . what i want to see is a study on the quality of life coffee drinkers have compared to non-coffee drinkers . it ’ s not about just adding years to life you see , it ’ s more about adding life to those additional years . quality as well as quantity . stay healthy everyone ! i wonder if these patients were wfpb eaters as well ? as i see it more _ life _ and _ years _ are added by eating wfpb than by any realistic beverage choices one makes . stated othewise , the “ battle ” is the food , beverages are just skirmishes.i am soooo in agreement ! most people are happy to share how good or bad this or that particular ingredient , “ super food ” or supplement is , while they remain totally oblivious to the big picture … a wfpb diet ! amen.i gave up coffee about 10 years ago and my experience is that i feel much better with a much more even energy and mental state throughout the day . i drank at most 3 or 4 cups a day . also i each a plant based diet and have for about 15 years.regarding the studies on the effect of coffee drinking on mortality or any of the other studies , it would be interesting to see studies comparing coffee drinkers and non-drinkers but who all have plant-based diets . i wonder if any benefits of coffee drinking are only compensating for other bad diet choices and are not present with a plant-based diet . this may be analogous that in mediterrean style diets the bad effects of olive oil are somewhat compensated by the plant foods in that diet.do we know whether the beneficial effects of coffee come from its polyphenols or caffeine ? i can not believe i just ran out of coffee , my wife ’ s got the car till monday and my monthly report is due . so i have to survive 4 days without any means of making a cup a joe except possibly some remnant whitloof that wintered over out back … i am going to have to science the sh ! t out of this ! hitch a ride to the truck stop ( ride a bike ? ) , fill a thermos or two , and mete it out carefully to make it last.yeah man , hadn ’ t thought of that … the truck stop . like in usamerica right ? trucks have to stop wheres. must have coffee. dig it . the truck stop . cripes what a country . ! yep , i ’ m gon hitch a ride to the truck stop … hey , whats that light up there in the sky ? i … i ’ m … whaa ? get that probe outta … whaa … .coffee ? ok then , shoulda sed so freak.it wasn ’ t really the coffee i was too concerned with since it ’ s limited in amount and never affects me , but it ’ s what else goes into it that can be problematic ! like that nasty non dairy creamer i am so guiltily still using , though just to lighten the plant milk a bit ! my only unhealthy processed holdover i need to ditch ! ! ! anybody have a good alternative for someone who likes their coffee light , not sweet ? give hemp milk a try , if you have not already done so . i have used almond hemp milk in the past , and it was much nicer than almond or soy milk . mixed really well without all that ‘ wierdness ’ of other plant milks ( probably owing to its higher fat content ) , and had a smooth finish / mouthfeel similar to those nasty trans-fat creamers out there , but with none of the guilt.i will if i can find it around here , thanks ! chances are , you won ’ t find it ( after all , it has the word ‘ hemp ’ in it … ) . but , you can buy it ’ til the cows come home on amazon : http : / / www.amazon.com / gp / product / b002bg38r8 / ref = s9 _ dcbhz _ bw _ d0 _ g325 _ i1 _ shyeah , that evil hemp , what a joke . thanks for the link and the humor ! try some lighter roasts or roast it yourself to see if you can go to straight coffee . i ’ m glad i never developed the taste for additives and am amazed at how good super-fresh coffee can be . adding other flavors would cover up the complexities . “ that nasty non dairy creamer ” nasty ingredients but sure tastes good . rarely drink coffee anymore because i really like it with that nasty stuff in it . specially the hazelnut creme.charzie , i ’ m old . i witnessed that whole change over from actual milk ( remember when we ’ d ask “ take cream ? ” and it was really just milk right ? i came back to usa year by year and it was like the body snatchers for real … no more milk , no more 1 / 2n1 / 2 … just this wierd “ non-diary cremer ” food like substance . my heart breaks for you … .. ok fast forward to now . my ann uses soymilk and it works quite great. it curdles in instant coffee ( our national drink ! ) , but it is good in fresh-brewed . not so for you ? myself , i remember my sainted , diabetic mother telling my young self , “ learn to drink your coffee black and you won ’ t have to complicate things ” . she was so wise . other than black , coffee tastes like medicine to me.coffee raises cholesterol and increases inflammation . use of paper filters reduces these increases but does not eliminate them . tea is probably the safer option. http : / / www.nature.com / ejcn / journal / v57 / n9 / full / 1601668a.html http : / / www.sciencedirect.com / science / article / pii / s0899900713000452just askin … got any coffee over there tom ?

mine is pretty bad.i ’ ve not found any and tinnitus is the one thing i don ’ t expect to cure with wfpb . although i don ’ t get the “ enhanced ” ringing from taking nsaids ( sometimes ) any more because i simply don ’ t take nsaids as much as before.also i ’ ve been on and off caffeine a few times in the last 20 years and never related it to more or less tinnitus . funny thing is i can still hear better than most folks , just have an overlay of the ringing / buzzing / chirping ( it varies ) .please let us know if you find some effective way to reduce tinnitus.interesting. the only thing i ’ ve found which definitely affects my tinnitus ( other than loud sounds ) is stress and alcohol . i have a suspicion that caffeine may somehow aggravate it but i can ’ t say for sure.nowadays whenever i ’ m around noisy environments i carry a pair a 3m clear ear earplugs . they ’ re nearly invisible and work very well . cheap too ! i wear earplugs for practically everything . mowers , tractors , power tools , motorboats … etcgood one ! tinnitus is one of those sneaky things that you don ’ t give much thought ( at least i didn ’ t … ) until you have a constant ringing in your ears.i ’ ve been a china collector for twenty years . i know that for at least a century , china coffee cups were produced to hold eight ounces and tea cups to hold six ounces . standard-sized tea pots held thirty-six ounces , thus six cups of tea . china demitasse cups meant for espresso hold three ounces . when ceramic mugs began being produced in the 1950s and 1960s , they were made of all sizes but tended to be a least nine ounces up to twelve and fourteen ounces.i also stopped coffee few years ago , and feel better – more “ in control ” without coffee . i wonder why the benefits of coffee has recently been promoted so much – maybe coffee producers are campaigning ? ; or there are many people who just cannot stop coffee , so , they can use a positive effect ( vis-a-vis many negative ones ) as an excuse.i ’ m in the middle of a 21 days no coffee challenge . without that getting high from coffee , now i need to engage time consuming exercise like swimming or hot yoga to feel that energy and happiness . i also found the convenience of not having to p so much . 7 more days to go for my no coffee experiment . i ’ m also going to try using large quantity of tomato to get high.whats the result please ? my results are awesome . just 1 more hour , i complete my 21 days no coffee challenge . more stable energy . better relaxation . pure happiness from exercise and eating fruits . i think coffee , smokes , cancer inducing food … and all the good stuff in life better consume on special celebration.various studies have linked caffeine consumption with reducing risk of alzheimer ’ s . for example , http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1046 / j.1468-1331.2002.00421.x / abstractmay be … . could be … .. appears to be … .it seems all the quotes studies are not definitive & useless – because it could also be the reverse.cold brewing coffee is said to greatly reduce the acidity content of coffee . it definitely has a very distinct , smooth flavor . i gave my plastic walgreens cold brew set away recently , ( and now am thinking i may have to find a new glass one ! ) however , research aside , i think many people may not realize how caffeine effects them until they give it up for a while , and then have a little . for the people who are quick to get irritated or anxious , too much coffee may be their foe , rather than their friend . that said , i ’ ve always loved a good , dark roast or shot of espresso here and there ! atrial fibrillation , bone fractures , bone health , caffeine , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chocolate , coffee , dark chocolate , diabetes , energy drinks , epilepsy , gerd , glaucoma , heart disease , heart health , heartburn , incontinence , mortality , safety limits , seizures , sleep , stroke , tea , women 's health what effect does coffee and tea consumption have on longevity , cancer risk , gerd reflux , bone fractures , glaucoma , sleep quality , and atrial fibrillation ( irregular heartbeat ) ?

" because heart disease was the leading cause of death , it comes as no surprise that dietary cholesterol consumption was significant risk factor for dying . the second leading cause was smoking-related cancer deaths , but what 's so neat about this study is that it 's a competing risks analysis , so it allowed them to compare different risks to one another . consuming the amount of cholesterol found in just a single egg-a-day appears to cut a woman ’ s life short as much as smoking , 5 cigarettes a day , for 15 years.a finding supported last month in this landmark article by a crack team of canadian researchers , who found a similar exponential increase in artery clogging plague in smokers and egg eaters.the most protective behavior they found was fiber consumption . eating just a cup of oatmeal ’ s worth of fiber a day appears to extend a woman 's life as much as 4 hours of jogging a week , but of course there ’ s no reason you can ’ t do both.it 's worth noting that the intake of cholesterol , only found in animal foods , was associated with living a shorter life and the intake of fiber , only found in plant foods , was associated with living a longer life.the one specific food most tied to longevity was , nuts . you also appear to get 4 hours of weekly jogging benefit eating just two handfuls of nuts a week.yeah , heart disease , # 1 cause of death , but what if your cholesterol 's normal ? i hear that all the time , and have to break it to them that having a “ normal ” cholesterol in a society where it 's normal to … drop dead of a heart attack — is not necessarily a good thing . remember , it 's our # 1 killer . in a huge study last year , most heart attack patients " fell within recommended targets for ldl cholesterol , demonstrating that the current guidelines may not be low enough to cut heart attack risk . " close to half of heart attack victims had quote-unquote “ optimal ” cholesterol levels … though i ’ m not sure their grieving spouses and orphaned children will take much comfort in that fact . what is considered " optimal " is still too high . yeah , having a below average cholesterol reduces your risk , but , as the editor-in-chief of the american journal of cardiology wrote more than a decade ago , it ’ s time to shift from just decreasing risk to actually preventing and arresting atherosclerosis . you don 't want low risk ; you want no risk — how do you do it . “ for the build-up of plaque in our arteries to cease , it appears that the serum total cholesterol needs to be lowered to the 150 area . in other words the serum total cholesterol must be lowered to that of the average pure vegetarian . because relatively few persons are willing to abide by the vegetarian lifestyle , lipid-lowering drugs are required in most to reach the 150 level . so it 's our choice.so it 's our choice — diet or drugs . why not just choose the drugs ? the fda just announced newly-mandated safety labeling for cholesterol-lowering statin drugs like lipitor , mevacor , crestor , zocor , and vytorin , etc . the fda issued new side-effect warnings regarding the increased risk of brain related side effects such as memory loss and confusion , an increase in blood sugar levels and risk of new-onset diabetes . one prominent cardiologist described the faustian bargain : fewer heart attacks , but more diabetes . and , we learned just a few weeks ago " adverse effects of statins on energy levels and fatigue even at moderate doses , particularly for women.with all the memory loss and confusion caused by these drugs , folks may forget there 's actually way to lower the risk of heart attacks and diabetes at the same time , a plant-based diet.now cholesterol is just half of the heart disease story . the other half is inflammation . we ’ ve known for 15 years , that a single meal high in animal fat — sausage and egg mcmuffins were used in the original study — can paralyze our arteries , cutting their ability to relax normally in half within just hours of eating animal products . the lining of our entire vascular tree gets inflamed and stiffened . and just as the inflammatory crippled state starts to calm down 5 or 6 hours later — lunchtime ! we may then whack our arteries with another load of meat , eggs , or dairy for lunch , such that most people are stuck in this chronic low-grade inflammation danger zone , which may set them up for inflammatory diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , and cancer one meal at a time . does the same thing to our lungs--again , within hours . inflammation in our airways . a single meal causing internal damage not just decades down the road but right then and there , that day , within hours of it going in your mouth.and just this year , we may have finally solved the mystery as to why . it doesn 't appear to be the animal fat itself . and it 's apparently not the animal protein , ( which is what we see triggering inflammation in arthritis ) . so if it 's not the animal fat , and it 's not the animal protein , what is it ? the whole thing is a crazy cool detective story that i 'll be putting up in a series of videos next week actually , but i 'll just cut to the chase — spoiler alert ! after a meal of animal products , people suffer from endotoxemia , their bloodstream becomes awash with bacterial toxins , known as endotoxins , that are present in animal products . so oo wonder our body goes crazy . these dead meat bacteria toxins aren 't destroyed by stomach acid … aren 't destroyed by digestive enzymes , aren 't destroyed by cooking — they tried boiling meat for hours . " these bacterial endotoxins were found to be highly resistant to cooking and our bodies ’ best attempts at acid and enzyme digestion . " and then the animal fat actually does play a profound role , ferrying the bacterial toxins present in the meat through the gut wall into our system.so the reason animal products trigger immediate inflammation appears to be because they 're so loaded with bacteria that can trigger inflammation dead or alive even when they 're fully cooked , and saturated animal fat then boosts the absorption of the bacterial toxins into our bloodstream.so now that we know what 's going on , what do we need to do ? from a 2012 follow-up : " while the most obvious solution to this metabolic endotoxemia appears to be to reduce saturated fat intake " ( which in this country comes mostly from cheese and chicken ) , but , they say , " the western diet is not conducive to this mode of action ; it 's difficult for patients to comply with this request . " so what ? let 's not even tell them ? this patronizing attitude in the medical profession that " oh , patients won 't improve their diets , or stop smoking — even if it 's going to save their lives , so why bother ? " that attitude may be one of the true leading causes of death . but let 's get back to the official list , and take on cancer next . what 's the latest ? we know from the largest forward-looking study on diet and cancer ever , that “ the incidence of all cancers combined is lower among vegetarians , ” especially some of the fastest growing tumors , lymphomas and leukemias. and for that the worst meat was actually chicken … . up to triple the rates for every , 50 grams of daily poultry consumption . that 's just a quarter of a chicken breast may triple your risk . the link between meat and cancer is such that even the journal meat science asked last year “ should we become vegetarians , or … can we make meat safer . there ’ s a bunch of additives , for example , that “ can suppress the toxic effects of heme iron , ” the blood iron that ’ s found in meat . these additives are still under study , but “ could provide an acceptable way to prevent colon cancer , ” because evidently avoiding meat is just out of the question . they fear that if the national cancer institute recommendations to reduce meat consumption “ were adhered to , sure , cancer incidence may be reduced , but famers and the meat industry would suffer important economical problems … .. ” for those of us more concerned about the suffering caused the meat industry , than the suffering of the meat industry , what happens if you put cancer on a vegan diet ? the pritikin research foundation just completed an elegant series of experiments that i want to spend a bit of time on them . simple experiments . they put people on different diets , drew their blood and dripped their blood on cancer cells growing in petri dish and just stood back to see whose blood was better at suppressing cancer growth . they were the ones that published that study showing the blood of those on a vegan diet was dramatically less hospitable to cancer . even the blood of those on a standard american diet fights cancer ; if it didn ’ t everyone would be dead . it ’ s just that the blood of those eating vegan fights about 8 times better.the blood of those on the standard american diet slows cancer growth rate down about 9 % . put people on a plant-based diet for a year , though , and their blood just tears it up . the blood circulating within the bodies of vegans has nearly 8 times the stopping power when it comes to cancer cell growth.now this was for prostate cancer , the most common cancer of men , in women , it ’ s breast cancer , so the pritikin researchers tried duplicating the study with women using breast cancer cells instead . they didn ’ t want to wait a whole year to get the results , though . so they figured they ’ d see what a plant-based diet could do in just two weeks , against three different types of human breast cancer . this is the before , cancer growth powering away at 100 % . and then after , eating a plant-based diet for 14 days . here 's the before picture , a layer of breast cancer cells is laid downin a petri dish and then blood from women eating the standard american diet is dripped on them , and as you can see , even people eating crappy diets have some ability to break down cancer . but after just 12 days eating healthy , blood was drawn from those same women , dripped on another carpet of breast cancer cells and this is what you 're left with . their bodies cleaned up ! slowing down the growth of cancer cells is nice , but getting rid of them completely is even better . this is what 's " tunel " imaging , which measures dna fragmentation , cell death . dying cells show up as white spots . so again , this is the before , what the blood of your average woman can do to breast cancer cells . if can kill of a few . but then after 12 days of healthy plant-based living their blood can do this.this is called programmed cancer cell death . after eating healthy , their own bodies were able to reprogram the cancer cells — forcing them into early retirement . it ’ s like you ’ re an entirely different person insidethe same blood that was now coursing through these womens ' bodies gained the power to significantly slow down , and stop breast cancer cell growth thanks to just two weeks of eating a plant-based diet.what kind of blood do we want in our body , what kind of immune system ? do we want blood that just kind of rolls over when cancer cells pop up , or do we want blood circulating to every nook and cranny of our body that has the power to slow down and stop them ? now this strengthening of cancer defenses was after 14 days of a plant-based diet and exercise , they were out walking 30 to 60 minutes a day . maybe the only reason their blood started becoming so effective at suppressing cancer growth was because of the exercise — maybe the diet had nothing to do with it . so they put it do the test.this is measuring cancer cell clearance . this is what we saw before , the effect of blood taken from those who ate a plant-based diet , in this case for 14 years and along with mild exercise — like just walking every day . plant-based diet and walking — that 's the kind of cancer cell clearance you get . compared to the cancer stopping power of your average sedentary meat-eater , which is basically nonexistent.this middle group , instead of 14 years on a plant-based diet , ate 14 years of a standard american diet but had 14 years of daily strenuous , hour-long exercise , like calisthenics . the researchers wanted to know if you exercise hard enough , long enough , can you rival some strolling plant-eaters.and … exercise helped — no question , but literally 5,000 hours in the gym , was no match for a plant-based diet . here ’ s an actual photomicrograph of cancer cells stained so that they ’ d release light when they die . as you can see in the control group , there were a few cancer cells dying . even if you are a couch potato eating fried potatoes , your body ’ s not totally defenseless . but here ’ s the hard-core strenuous exercise group . cancer cells dying left and right . but nothing appears to kick cancer butt more than a plant based diet . why , though ? some people don 't care why , but i 'm always curious . how does a simple dietary change make one ’ s bloodstream so inhospitable to cancer in just a matter of days ? we didn 't know until last year , when " [ they ] sought to determine the underlying mechanisms for these anticancer effects . ” it 's a wild story i have a whole series of videos coming out about . it in involves little people , big people ; it involves big dogs and … little dogs , the story involves marshmallows … tinkertoys … cannibalism , and vegan bodybuilders , from beef steak to beefcake — i wish i had time — but the videos will be up soon . bottomline — the answer to the pritikin puzzle is igf-1.insulin-like growth factor one is a cancer-promoting growth hormone involved in every stage of cancer growth , proliferation , metastasis , and invasion . but you put people on a plant-based diet and their igf-1 levels go down , and if they stay on a plant-based diets their levels drop even further.and their igf-1 binding protein levels go up . that ’ s one way our body tries to protect itself from cancer — from excessive growth — by releasing a binding protein into our bloodstream to tie up igf-1 . it 's like our body ’ s emergency brake . yes , in as little as 11 days , a plant-based diet can reprogram your body to bring down igf-1 production , but you still have all that igf-1 circulating in your bloodstream from the bacon and eggs you had the week before . so , your liver releases a snatch squad of binding proteins to take it out of circulation , and as you can see it just gets better and better the longer you eat healthy . here 's the experiment that nailed igf-1 as the villain . same as last time . go on a plant-based diet ; cancer cell growth drops ; and cancer cell death , shoots up . but then here ’ s the kicker . what if you added back to the cancer the exact same amount of igf-1 banished from your body because you were eating healthy ? … it erases the diet and exercise effect . it ’ s like you never started eating healthy at all.so that 's how we know that lowering animal product consumption leads to lower igf-1 , which leads to lower cancer growth . but how low does animal-product-consumption have to go ? how plant-based does our diet need to get ? well , let ’ s look at igf1 levels in meateaters , versus vegetarians , versus vegans . does a plant-based diet work better at lower the circulating level of igf-1 compared with a meat-eating or lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet , and this is what they found . only the vegans had significantly lower levels . and the same relationship found with igf-binding capacity . only the vegans were significantly able to bind up excess igf-1 in their blood streams.this was a study done on women … , what about vegan men ? they found the same thing … so even though vegan men tend to have significantly higher testosterone levels , than both vegetarians and meateaters — which can be a risk factor for prostate cancer , the reason plant-based diets appear to reverse the progression of prostate cancer , ,, may be due to how low their igf-1 drops . high testosterone , yet low cancer.the bottom line … is that male or female , just eating vegetarian did not seem to cut it — didn 't do their body many favors . it looks like to get a significant drop in cancer-promoting growth hormone levels one really has to move towards eliminating animal products altogether . the good news is that given what we now know about igf-1 , we can predict “ that a … vegan diet may be profoundly protective with respect to , for example , risk for breast cancer in older women . ” ok , just 13 causes of death to go ! what time is it ? let me quickly run the list . the top three killers used to be heart disease / cancer / stroke . oh , that is so 2011 . now it 's heart disease , cancer and copd — like emphysema . thankfully , copd can be prevented with the help of a plant-based diet , and even treated with plants if you want to check that out.of course , the tobacco industry viewed these landmark findings a little differently . instead of adding plants to ones diet to prevent emphysema , wouldn ’ t it be simpler to just add them to the cigarettes ? and whallah , the addition of acai berries to cigarettes evidently had a protective effect against emphysema in smoking mice . next they ’ re going to be putting berries in meat . i couldn 't make this stuff up . adding fruit extracts to burgers was not without its glitches , though . the blackberries “ literally dyed burger patties with a distinct purplish color … ” though infusing lamb carcasses with kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in does evidently improve tenderness … and it is possible to improve the nutritional profile of frankurters with powdered grape seeds … though there were complaints that the grape seed particles were visible in the final product , and if there ’ s one thing we know about hot dog eaters , it ’ s that they ’ re picky about what goes in their food . pig anus ? ok , but grape seeds ? ew ! preventing strokes , killer # 4 , is all about eating potassium rich foods . potassium , from the words pot ash . you take any plant , put it in a pot and reduce it to ash you 're left with pot-ash-ium — true story , but can anyone name me a plant food particularly high in potassium ? ? ? why is that like the one thing everyone knows about nutrition ? did chiquita have a good pr firm or something ? i bet you could walk into the heart attack grill , where they 're eating things like this , , and ask anyone , and they may be like " i don 't know what to should eat , but i do know bananas got potassium . " in reality , bananas don 't even make the top 50 sources , coming in at # 86 , right behind fast food vanilla milk shakes.let 's see who can guess the food with the highest potassium . let 's get everyone on their feet . is the whole food with the highest potassium content a fruit , vegetable , grain , bean , or nut . ok , root stem leaf or flower ? what kind of green and then number to beet — i keep giving you hint ) the top five sources are tomato and orange concentrates , and then in terms of whole foods , greens , beans , and dates . in fact if you look at the next leading cause of death , banana 's , could be downright dangerous . alzheimer 's , now our sixth leading killer . we 've known for nearly 20 years now , that those who eat meat — red or white — appear between 2 to 3 times more likely to become demented , compared to vegetarians . and the longer you 're vegetarian , the lower your risk of dementia . but the exciting new research is on treating alzheimer 's using natural plant remedies , which beat out placebo , and worked as well as a leading alzheimer 's drug . again , all on the website ; all for free . next on the kick-the-bucket , list … diabetes , which can be prevented , treated , and even reversed in many cases — check out brenda 's talk at 3 o 'clock today . this is from october . those eating vegetarian had significantly lower risk of diabetes , but vegans did the best . and ready for the shocker ? this was after controlling for obesity . sure vegans have less diabetes — they 're skinny , but even at the same weight , vegans had just a fraction of the diabetes risk.why are vegans , on average , so slim ? obesity is so rare among those eating plant based diets , nutrition researchers have been desperate to uncover their secret . yes , they tend to eat fewer calories … but not that many fewer . in the past i ’ ve gone through a couple of the theories that have emerged . maybe it 's because people eating plant-strong diets express more of the fat shoveling enzyme inside the powerplants — the mitochondria--within their cells , maybe it 's because they grow different populations of good bacteria in their gut , maybe it 's because they 're avoiding the obesogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals in meat ? an obesity-causing virus in poultry may even be contributing . we ’ re still not sure , but the theories keep coming . here 's the latest : maybe it ’ s the propionate . after all , what 's one of the things that ’ s only in plant foods , never in animal foods ? fiber . animals have bones to hold them up , plants have fiber to hold them up.i thought fiber was defined , though , by our inability to digest it . true , we can ’ t break down fiber , but the gazillions of good bacteria in our guts can . what do they make with it ? propionate , which gets absorbed into our blood stream . so technically we can digest fiber , but just not without a little help from our little friends . what does prionate do ? well it inhibits cholesterol synthesis . that ’ s nice . it also appears to have hypophagic effect , meaning it helps us eat less , apparently by slowing down the rate at which food empties from our stomachs , thereby making us feel fuller longer . “ propionate may either regulate food intake or the generation of new fat cells resulting in an overall anti-obesity effect . ” and we can boost the numbers of good bacteria in our gut without probiotics just by eating vegetarian , because we 're feeding our little friends with fiber.animal foods also tend to be more calorically dense . for example , to walk off the calories found in single pat of butter you ’ d have to add an extra 700 yards to your evening stroll … . a quarter mile jog … for each sardine you put in your mouth — and that 's just the edible part . and any who choose to eat two chickens legs better get out on their own two legs and go run an extra 3 miles that day to outrun weight gain.and that 's for steamed chicken … skin removed . here 's the latest : “ meat consumption and prospective weight change . ” “ ” hundreds of thousands of men and women across 10 countries with “ ” weight gain measured over a 5 year period . what did they find ? “ ” total meat consumption was associated with weight gain . “ ” conclusion : our results suggest that a decrease in meat consumption may improve weight management . and this was after controlling for initial weight , physical activity , educational level , smoking status , total energy intake … wait-a-second — what ? ! that 's the kicker.the link between meat and weight gain remained even after controlling for calories , meaning if you have two people eating the same number of calories — the person eating meat may gain more weight . in fact they even calculated how much more.an intake of 250 g meat / day--like a steak , would lead to an annual weight gain 422 g higher than the weight gain experienced with a same-calorie diet with lower meat content . after 5 y , the weight gain would be about 5 pounds more . same calories , yet 5 pounds heavier eating meat . and steak was nothing . “ the strongest relation with annual weight change — weight gain--was observed for poultry . ” let ’ s say you start out normal weight and eat a hamburger every day . this is how much extra weight beyond what ’ s already in the calories you ’ d put on every year . what if instead you had the same amount of calories of processed meat , say a ham sandwich ? you ’ d gain this much extra , whereas , just about a half a chicken breast puts you , up to here , above and beyond the calories . “ ” in conclusion , our results indicate that meat intake is associated with weight gain and this association persisted after adjustment for total energy intake . our results are therefore in favor of the public health recommendation to decrease meat consumption for health improvement . ” for more , make sure to catch the meat industry 's take on that study — very interesting , as well as pcrm 's amazing work putting a vegan diet to work in a corporate setting . kidney failure , 8th leading cause of death can be prevented with a plant-based diet ; can be treated with a plant-based diet . why ? our kidneys are highly vascular organs . that ’ s why kidneys look so , red inside . our two little kidneys filter through our entire blood supply . and so if the standard american diet is so toxic to blood vessels in our heart , brain , and pelvis , leading to heart attacks , strokes , and sexual dysfunction , what might it be doing to our kidneys ? long story short , harvard researchers found three significant risk factors for declining kidney function — meaning losing protein in your urine ( your body 's not supposed to be peeing out it 's protein ) . the three risk factors were animal protein , animal fat , and cholesterol . no such association was found for plant protein or plant fat . it 's not protein ; it 's not fat — it 's animal protein ; animal fat . not only do vegans appear to have better kidney function , dramatic improvements were found treating kidney failure patients with pure vegetarian diets after only one week . leading killer number nine is people dying from respiratory infections check out my video kale and the immune system , about the immunostimulatory effects of kale — is there anything kale can 't do ? and if you look at my video boosting immunity through diet , which was actually the video-of-the-day on wednesday of this week , you can see that even just eating a few extra fruits and vegetables can significantly improve one 's immune response to pneumococcal pneumonia . suicide , is number 10 . last year at summerfesti talked about improving mood through diet we knew vegetarian diets were associated with healthier mood states , but you can 't tell if it 's cause and effect until you put it to the test , which they did this year . you take regular meat-eaters , and remove meat , fish , poultry — and eggs , from their diets , and you can see a significant improvement in mood scores , after just two weeks — it can take drugs like prozac months to take effect.the way drugs like prozac work is by elevating levels of serotonin , the so-called happiness hormone . did you know there 's serotonin in plants ? i certainly didn 't , but there 's serotonin , and dopamine and all sorts of human neurotransmitters in plants so much so there 's been a call to start treating depression with high-content sources of serotonin , you know , like plantains , pineapples , bananas , kiwis , plums , and tomatoes . and what 's the side-effects , maybe you 'll get a little strawberry seed stick in your teeth or something ? maybe that 's why a high intake of vegetables , fruit , mushrooms , and soy was associated with a decreased prevalence of depressive symptoms . maybe that 's why improved behavior in teenagers was significantly associated with higher intakes of leafy green vegetables and fresh fruit.for more , keep an eye out for my videos coming up on the wrong way to boost serotonin , which is taking tryptophan supplements. better ways to boost serotonin , to fight disorders such as premenstrual depression , and the best way … as reported in this double-blind , placebo controlled crossover study of the successful use of butternut squash seeds , in the treatment of social anxiety disorder , for example . how might a plant-based diet prevent systemic infections ? well , meat-borne bacteria can t directly invade one 's bloodstream through the intestinal wall , or in women creep up into their bladder . just last month , june 2012 , direct dna fingerprinting proof that women are getting urinary tract infections from eating meat contaminated with fecal bacteria , which then crawl up into your bladder. and chicken is the most likely reservoir.wait a second . you can ’ t sell unsafe cars , you can ’ t sell unsafe toys , how how is it legal to sell unsafe meat ? they do it by blaming the consumer . as one usda poultry microbiologist said : “ raw meats are not idiot-proof . they can be mishandled and when they are , it ’ s like handling a hand grenade . if you pull the pin , somebody ’ s going to get hurt . ” see if we get sick , it ’ s our fault.while some may question the wisdom of selling hand grenades in the supermarket , the usda poultry expert disagrees : “ i think the consumer has the most responsibility but refuses to accept it . ” that ’ s like a car company saying yeah , we installed faulty brakes , but it ’ s your fault for not putting your kid in a seatbelt . a director of at the centers for didsease control responded famously to this kind of blame-the-victim attitude . “ is it reasonable , ” she asked , ‘ “ that if a consumer undercooks a hamburger … their three-year-old dies ? ” is that reasonable ? not to worry , though : the meat industry 's on it . they just got the fda approval for a bacteria-eating virus to spray on meat . now some have raised concerns about these so-called bacteriophages , such as the the possibility of the viruses spreading toxin genes between bacteria , especially given the difficulties in preventing of large numbers of these viruses from being released into the environment from the slaughterhouses.it could also allow the meat industry to become even more complacent about food safety if they know they can just spray some viruses on at the end , similar to the quick fix argument about irradiation . from the industry point of view , who cares if there ’ s fecal matter in the meat as long as it ’ s blasted at the end with enough radiation . now the meat industry 's concerned that consumer acceptance of bacteria-eating viruses may present something of a challenge . if they think that 's going to be a challenge , check out their other bright idea the “ effect of extracted housefly pupae on chilled pork preservation . ” a sciency way of saying they want smear a maggot mixture on meat . it 's a low cost and simple method . think about it . maggots thrive on rotting meat , yet , there have been no reports that maggots have any serious diseases — not that anyone checked , but … indicating that they have a strong immune system . they must be packed with some sort of antibacterial properties — otherwise they ’ d get infected and die themselves . so they took maggots who were 3 days old , washed them , dried them--toweled them off — put through them in tissue blender — a little vitamix action , and whallah ! safer meat . we did kidney failure , what about liver failure . we 've known for 35 years--since 1977 , that a vegetable-protein diet could be used to treat liver failure , significantly reducing the toxins that would otherwise have built up eating meat with a less-than-functional liver . imagine eating meat without a fully functional liver to detoxify your blood.i do have to admit , though , that some people live on plant-based diets have worsening liver function . they 're called , alcoholics … in fact strictly plant-based living on potatoes , corn , grapes , barley — and yet still for some reason not doing so hot . high blood pressure is next , so-called essential hypersension , essentially , only found in people that eat meat . again , look at this — we 've known for decades , that " consumption of food of animal origin was highly significantly associated with blood pressure " — even after " weight effects were removed . " fast forward 39 years to 2012 . compared to nonvegetarians , as you go more and more plant-based — flexitarian , to just eating fish , to lacto-ovo to vegan you can see hypertension rates drop progressively down to a small fraction . same thing with diabetes , a stepwise drop in risk as you lower animal product consumption . same thing with body mass index , in fact vegans were the only dietary group that is on average not overweight — even the vegetarians were overweight . diabetes and hypertension are both leading causes of death . is it going to take doctors another 39 years before we actually start doing something about it ? how long does it take being vegan , to bring blood pressures down ? twelve , days ! mcdougall took 500 meateaters , but them on a vegan diet , and over a span of 11 days dropped their blood pressures 6 % , and up to twice that in those that came in hypertensive . 14th leading killer is parkinson 's . does a plant-based diet reduce risk of parkinson 's disease ? good question . well we know that every single prospective study on " dairy products or milk " and parkinson 's disease found increased risk . why ? well , one possibility is that dairy products in the united states are contaminated with neurotoxic chemicals . there 's substantial evidence " suggesting that exposure to pesticides may increase parkinson ’ s disease risk , " and autopsies have found higher levels of pollutants and pesticides in the brains of parkinson ’ s disease patients [ … ] and some of these toxins are present at low levels in dairy products . they 're talking about toxins like tetrahydroisoquinoline , a parkinsonism-related compound found predominantly in cheese . although the amounts of this neurotoxin — even in cheese — are really " not very high , " the concern is that the chemical may accumulate in the brain over long periods of consumption . and finally , aspiration pneumonia , which is caused by swallowing problems due to parkinson 's , or alzheimers , or a stroke , all of which we 've already covered.so , where does this leave us ? these are the top fifteen reasons americans die , and a plant-based diet can help prevent , nearly all of them … , can help treat , more than half of them , and in some cases even reverse the progression of disease , including our top three killers.there are drugs that can help too . you can take one drug to treat cholesterol every day for the rest of your life , another drug for blood sugars , a couple different pills for high blood pressure.the same diet , though , does it all ! it 's not like one diet for this ; a different diet for that . one diet to rule them all.and what about drug side-effects ? i 'm not talking a little rash or something . prescription drugs kill … more than a hundred thousand americans every year . and that ’ s not medication errors , not abuse , not overdose ; that ’ s just deaths from side-effects , adrs , adverse drug reactions to prescription drugs.wait a second , 106,000 deaths a year ? that means , that the six leading cause of death — is actually doctors ! the sixth leading cause of death … is me ! thankfully , i can be prevented , with a plant based diet … seriously , though . seriously , compared to 15,000 american vegetarians , meateaters had about twice the odds of being on aspirin , sleeping pills , tranquilizers , antacids , pain-killers , blood pressure medications , laxatives and insulin . so plant-based diets are great for those that don 't like taking drugs , or paying for drugs , or risking adverse effects.this study did show , though , that plant-based diets have their own side-effects . side-effects include less chronic disease , fewer allergies , and fewer surgeries , vegetarians have less varicose veins to hemorrhoids — even fewer hysterectomies . and not just protection from the big killers like coronary artery disease , strokes , high blood pressure , diabetes , but less diverticulosis , for example--significantly fewer diseases overall — that 's the side-effects of a plant-based diet . less disease overall . here 's the allergies thing . according to the longest running study on vegetarians in history , compared to vegetarians , women who eat meat appear to have a 30 % greater chance of reporting chemical allergies , 24 % more asthma , more drug allergies and even bee-sting allergies , and 15 % more hayfevera new side-effect of plant-based eating we just learned about last year — fewer cataracts . that 's what we get — fewer cataracts , the leading cause of blindness and vision loss . compared to those just eating about a single serving of meat a day , cutting down to half a serving a day appears to cut risk 15 % , just do fish you 're down 21 % , no fish 30 % drop in risk , and then no eggs and dairy for the full 40 % drop in cataract risk.and that 's all in addition to my favorite side-effect of plant-based diets , helping to prevent 15 of our top 16 killers.want to solve the healthcare crisis ? i have a suggestion.imagine , if our nation embraced a plant-based diet . imagine if we just significantly cut back on meat . there is one country that tried.after world war 2 , finland joined us in packing on the meat , eggs , and dairy . by the 1970 ’ s , the mortality rate from heart disease of finnish men was the highest in the world , even putting us to shame . they didn ’ t want to die , so they got serious . heart disease is caused by high cholesterol , high cholesterol is caused by high saturated fat intake , so the main focus of the strategy was to reduce the high saturated fat intake in the country . so that means cheese and chicken , cake and pork . so , a berry project was launched to help dairy farmers make a switch to berry farming . whatever it took and indeed , many farmers did switch from dairies to berries . they pitted villages against each other in friendly cholesterol-lowering competitions to see who could do best.so how ’ d they do ? on a population scale , even if mortality rates drop 5 % you could still save thousands of lives . but remarkably great changes took place … an 80 % drop in cardiac mortality across the entire country . “ with greatly reduced cardiovascular and cancer mortality the all cause mortality has reduced about 45 % , leading to greater life expectancy : approximately 7 years for men and 6 years for women . ” and that was just cutting down on animal products.now vying for the world record for heart disease deaths , the united states of america.so why doesn 't our government make those same recommendations ? i 've got a whole series of videos on the conflicts of interests within the u.s. dietary guideline committees . whether being funded by candy bar companies , or the sugar association . or a member of the " mcdonald 's council on healthy lifestyles , " or , serving on coca cola 's beverage institute for health and wellness . notice we only found out about this thanks to a lawsuit by pcrm suing usda . one committee member , served as a duncan hines “ brand girl ” and then as the official crisco brand girl.these are the folks that dictate u.s. nutrition policy . if you read the official dietary guidelines committee recommendations you 'll note there 's “ no discussion at all , of the scientific research on the health consequences of eating meat . if the committee actually discussed this research , it would be unable to justify its recommendation to eat meat at all , as the research would show that meat increases the risks of chronic diseases , contrary to the purposes of the guidelines . thus , by simply ignoring that research , the committee is able to reach a conclusion that would otherwise look improper . ” they can 't even talk about the science . we know that “ a plant-based diet of fruits , vegetables , whole grains , legumes , and no meat reversed heart disease , completely prevented deaths from heart disease , and slowed the progression of cancer , and an almost identical diet is promoted by the world cancer research fund to prevent cancer , as based on the largest review of scientific studies to date . ” but again , they can 't even talk about the science because how could they justify anything but a plant-based diet ? let me end , with what is probably the best summary of nutrition policy in the united states i 've ever seen : " the new dietary guidelines have been released . they tell us to eat healthier … but … not so healthy as to noticeably affect any corporate profits.if you want to share what you saw today with others , i have this presentation on dvd , with all proceeds donated to charity . today ’ s video-of-the-day is a nutritionfacts.org first . though i don ’ t always succeed , i normally strive to make each of my videos about two minutes in length to match the typical online attention span . that ’ s why when this presentation was serendipitously taped last month , i turned it into a short dvd rather than uploading it directly to the site . but the response it got was so positive , that i really wanted to get it online . if you too found it valuable , please share it and pass it along . and if you haven ’ t already , you can subscribe for free to my videos at http : / / bit.ly / nutritionfactsupdates . tomorrow we ’ ll return to our regularly scheduled program of more bite-sized servings of the latest in nutritional science.dr. greger i so enjoy your morning videos . my only complaint is when they stop at 2 minutes ! wow ! what a treat ! thank you for posting this online for us ! ! : ) phenomenal ! like a said before this video should be required viewing in all medical , dental , nursing , and paramedical schools as well as by the general public before ever stepping foot inside a restaurant or market.absolutely incredible that you made this free ! ! ! thank you ! ; - } goverment usually would not like to spread out astonishing things , i guess . people like consistence , a kind of habit , no matter very bad , people tend to find the reasons to keep it , while resist the changing . the root reason is that going upstream to build a good habit needs energy . i know it ’ s hard to do so , but it is possible to open a vegan hospital -our own realm . if that happens , please employ me ! i am a mpt student in canada and taichi coach . i led vegan diet workshops in a senior center in toronto , 2010if that ever happens i will be giving you a call ! but i don ’ t see that happening anytime soon . the seventh day adventists already do a modified vegan version of this type . doctor , could you please tell me which hospitals of adventists in canada or us still practice vegan diet ? how i can contact with you except on this website ? adventist hospitals , of which there are many , seem to be very normal in their medical practice , i thought . do they , perhaps , cater better than other hospitals with food . are there any in the united kingdom ? if so , i ’ ll be interested to explore further.when i lived in orlando the adventist hospital cafeteria was meat free.actually , no , it shouldn ’ t . you see med school is generally not fond of agenda-driven “ science . ” thank you again for your work . i just pre-ordered the set along with those extra dvds ( cancer prevention , bird flu , etc ) . can ’ t wait for them.i shared this link with my mom and she ’ s now sharing it with others . : ) vegans are an intellectually crazy bunch . go primal when you realise this is a scam . do you have the research to back this up ? how exactly is a plant-based diet a “ scam ” ? i don ’ t think name-calling and insults are going to win the primal movement any converts . you may want to try another outreach / recruitment approach to convince people of the merits of primal eating . if the goal is preventing and treating disease by way of diet , it seems clear from the currently available scientific evidence that some diets are better at preventing and treating disease than others . it just so happens that “ the balance of scientific evidence suggests that the healthiest way to eat [ to prevent and treat disease ] is a vitamin b12-fortified diet of whole plant foods ” . at the moment , it seems that there is not enough evidence ( and definitely not a balance of evidence ) to indicate that other diets are capable of preventing and treating disease to the same degree that a plant-based diet can for most people . moreover , i think it is also debatable whether a meat-based primal / paleo / caveman / low-carb diet is a sensible and healthy way to eat for the planet – but that is discussion for another forum . but since you brought it up , you may want to read these : http : / / www.npr.org / blogs / 13.7 / 2011 / 10 / 27 / 141666659 / the-paleo-diet-not-the-way-to-a-healthy-futurehttp : / / www.theatlantic.com / health / archive / 2011 / 07 / the-paleo-diet-caveman-cure-all-or-unhealthy-fad / 242621 / # http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / misc / 2012nl / jun / paleo2.htmin sum , whether you look at it from a health , environment , or human rights perspective a vegetarian diet is most certainly the best choice for human health , the sustainability of the environment , and the best ( maybe even only way ) that shows compassion toward both humans and other animals.nothing wrong with meat in the diet as long as it is organically raised , non-gmo feeds ( grain and corn is not natural food for any herbivore animal ) as they are raised organically without antibiotics / growth hormones away from factory farms.no need to insult each other ’ s diet / way of life . no one eats solely meat , people add veggies as well , etc . , unless following the traditional inuit diet which is raw meat or a few other tribal diets . to each their own . sadly , with the monsanto t-rex on the rampage , cross-contaminating organic fields with its seeds of destruction i worry that in 50 years there will be no natural plant life out there . then we are all up the creek including wildlife . well , there are always milkweed pods if monsanto doesn ’ t kill those off . these actually taste good when foraging in the wild but will taste like cardboard if altered genetically by monsanto . some are people are vegetarians but if they eat pesticide treated foods instead of organic , there are problems … purchasing dirty dozen celery in grocery stores laden with pesticides … not to mention the whole processed ‘ food ’ industry.there is no such way as “ the only way ’ since people have to find out what works for them and accept that not everyone is going to follow the same path.there is a tremendous body of evidence to discourage one from eating animal products . whether you ’ re sold on the idea from the compelling and still-growing consensus regarding your health , the undeniable impact such activities have on our environment , or the well being or misery of so many animals , i couldn ’ t imagine anything easier to argue and advocate for . world watch ’ s coverage of “ livestock ’ s long shadow , ” regarding the impossible environmental reality of raising meat on the scale we do , “ earthlings ” for a visceral look at the ethical realities , and the work of dr. greger , neal barnard , t. colin campbell , etc. for the preventive health impacts . i hope we can all see more improvement in the near future on these fronts . it ’ s going to take everyone ’ s humble and worthwhile efforts , though . : ) that ’ s the same old argument that is always used , example , it is used for climate change . as long as we burn clean coal , unleaded gas etc , blah , blah , blah . nuts ! no need to insult people but ok to shoot animals in the head and slit their throats. to each his own ? i guess that ’ s why some people felt it was ok to own slaves once upon a time . we must think outside ourselves. we are not the only creature , religion , sex , culture , race etc in the world . we have a history of thinking of only what is best for “ us ” to a detriment to others . thankfully , slaves are now free , women have been given equal rights , and hopefully , animals will be recognized next as being equally entitled to live their lives free of suffering and early death simply to satisfy our taste buds.sistadana ~ ~ do you really think a farmer is going to raise animals just for pets ? ? ? if everyone stops eating meat , there will be no animals ! ! ! katie : some ideas to think about : 1 ) we no longer use horses for transportation . while there are many fewer horses in the world compared to the past , there are still plenty of horses around . horses are not going away.2 ) lots of people love chickens as pets . a “ farmer ” may not raise animals just for pets . but plenty of people will . i know people who live in the country who just like to have llamas around for pets . they do not eat them . i know someone else who has a pet cow . there ’ s a youtube video of a teenage girl with a pet cow who she taught tricks to . etc.given all the available evidence , there is no reason to fear that “ there will be no animals ! ! ! ” hope that sets your mind at ease.according to science and evolution ( i recommend you see the three-episode series by niels shubin ) all creatures on this earth , and by all i really mean all ( if you watch the series you ’ d understand ) are actually coming from the fish in the sea some 200 million years ago . we basically carry the same genes throughout time . it is amazing how we evolved from a small fish and now we claim fish and animals have no soul and are some stupid creatures for us to eat and exploit , and we , the great humans , should rule the earth . alright , we have the head-start , but exactly this should make us even more responsible , and not more careless . we are all relatives , but we deny the other creatures on the planet the same rights we humans have – to live as they please . and katie , if you ’ re worried some animals would i should tell you that most wild animals on the planet already disappeared thanks to us and some like the tigers and lions won ’ t be found in the wild any more 30 years from now . they are gone by 98 % . don ’ t worry about the chicken and cows , they are a sturdy bunch and have lived without us and before us : - ) i finally found a place where someone has brains ! you know how hard it is to talk with someone about matters like this – i was called a complete moron once because i was suggesting how the human body has evolved and it ’ s in our dna / genes to survive … this woman told me that the only reason why humans survived was because of sex and reproduction … . i said wow … clearly she doesn ’ t know anything . i appreciate your comment because there are animals dying because of us … and they are going to be animals that will survive without humans involvement.wow. i appreciate your comment tremendously . i will have to share this with my family and friends.hey khemary , i ’ m kind of happy to know that someone appreciates what i share . i believe in science , but i believe in it when it has a heart . : ) i don ’ re think the vegan or vegetarian diet is the best diet for people or that any studies have shown it to be . in every case that i have read about a study it has compared the vegan to the standard american an diet . vegetarian diets rely on high starch and low fat . this absolutely doesn ’ t work well for a lot of people . when the question . of the best diet for people arises , i think it would be helpful to focus on that alone and not mix in arguments about kindness to animals or the environment since these are different questions.high starch low fat can be said for meat eaters too . i am vegan and eat a balance diet . you can ’ t say that all vegans eat a certain way. i wouldn ’ t call them “ crazy ” . if a diet works for someone , that ’ s fine. my problem with the stats being thrown about is that this all flies in the face of evolution. the facts pretty clearly show that high protein diets helped propel the growth of the brain and allowed the human species to flourish. so for hundreds of thousands of years , it was good and now suddenly it isn ’ t ? personally , i take issue with the western mentality that every problem needs a “ solution ” . oh , autism cases have spiked up ? wow , it ’ s funny how vaccinations have gone up , too , so let ’ s blame them. it ’ s the ability to understand and diagnoses problems that has developed and allowed us to understand these problems. i think moderation is key to a diet. not to mention there are going to be some disease , etc . , that genetically run in families. to simply point the finger at meat and say that all of our ills are from one thing is naive. and again , considering our brain ’ s growth being due to proteins from fish / meat , i can ’ t sit here and say it ’ s all been bad.i believe the brain is made up of mostly fat , and it runs on glucose . what role did protein supposedly play that you think was so important ? i ’ ve never heard that before.brain is made up of around 80 % choline .. lecithinwhy do you think god provided yo momma with teats to produce milk and not a couple of carrots or mangoes ? thats “ animal protein ” deary ; thats what make a babys brain grow- the richer , the better. maybe thats why so many children these days are “ special ” and / or sickly and / or have so many allergic reactions to everything these days- fed soy based ‘ formula ’ instead of good ol ’ mommas ‘ dairy ’ , not veggie harvest brand canned boob alternative- organic or otherwise ; ) all food production is being destroyed one way or another ; “ we the people ” better get off our collective , sedentary asses , quit bitching on blogs and get in on changing the game- before it changes us at the genetic level .. trying to use that kind of reasoning to “ figure things out ” has turned out to be a scientific dead end . there are simply too many factors to take into account . people have spent millenia trying to use clever reasoning to figure out how the world works , but it ’ s only since scientific revolution and the introduction of clinical & empirical research that we have gotten any real answers.trying to reason about evolution ( for example ) can give you ideas on what to research.it may sound reasonable that meat is crucial due to evolutionary adaptations in the human body . but it seems equally reasonable that our much longer evolutionary history as predominately plant-eaters is of greater importance.it may sound reasonable that the extra energy / protein from meat helped build bigger brains . but another reasonable theory is that increase was related to cooking in general . or that bigger brains were needed to solve more complex social problems as societies grew more complex ( independently of food sources ) .you also have to consider that the average human of the last 50,000 years only lived some 50 years , and as a result evolution hasn ’ t really acted on some of the health problems our societies are facing right now . it also sounds reasonable that the need for easily accessed energy ( from animal products ) used to outweigh the long-term problems associated with intake of animal products . but today the health risks associated with animal products suddenly outweigh the benefits , seeing how the production of animal foods are the less sustainable and ethical option today.these are just a few out of dozens or hundreds of “ reasonable hypothesises ” about human health and human evolution . but there is only one way to sort out what truly works for modern humans . it ’ s called empirical , clinical research . that research shows us how things truly work . from that data we can try to create theories on why things are like they are . but as soon as new data is presented the theories have to be adapted to take the new data into account . so you can ’ t simply come up with a theory like “ evolution tells us that we should eat meat ” , but instead you have to look at the empirical evidence and try to explain that in evolutionary terms ( if that ’ s what you ’ re interested in ) . “ reasonable hypothesises ” tell us nothing about reality , only empirical evidence does . the empirical data currently seems to support that a plant based diet is superior . which is the end of the story ( until other empirical data is presented ) . no reasoning about evolution can get around that hard data ( go ask any serious evolutionary biologist ! ) i get tired of people referring to the average age ( such as 50 above ) . during this time many people lived far far longer than this . through most of this history many infants died in the first five years of life , thus virtually halving the ‘ average ’ age.life expectancy at birth is indeed lower and is estimated at 20-30 years . the number i gave was life expectancy at older age , for people who lived beyond childhood . for rough estimates , see : https : / / en.wikipedia.org / wiki / life _ expectancy # life _ expectancy _ variation _ over _ timebut these are averages . naturally there were plenty of people who led longer lives than than the average population . how on earth can any thinker believe in the infantile theory of evolution ? no wonder some believe in the nonsense that sprouts from that … … … … … what alternative to evolution do your have ? creation- of which there are so many totally different stories in many religions are like lovely dreams that any of us can dream or imagine.i believe it ’ s the aeillo ’ s and wheeler ’ s original paper that a lot of people are referencing when claiming that eating meat lead to increased brain size . however , i ’ m almost certain that aeillo and wheeler are saying that the increased brain size lead to eating more calorie-dense foods , which would include meat.so with that said , our brains are fueled by carbohydrates , plus newer evidence suggests human brains size increased as a result of actually thinking . “ the so-called expensive-tissue hypothesis , which suggests a trade-off between the size of the brain and the size of the digestive tract , has been challenged by researchers at the university of zurich . they have shown that brains in mammals have grown over the course of evolution without the digestive organs having to become smaller . the researchers have further demonstrated that the potential to store fat often goes hand in hand with relatively small brains — except in humans , who owe their increased energy intake and correspondingly large brain to communal child care , better diet and their ability to walk upright . ” http : / /

had to do . however , if they lived long enough , this finding suggests that heart disease and other illnesses like arthritis could set in : “ otzi , who was 46 at the time of his death and measured

region … .perfect sets of teeth , 1 ft huger than him … the difference between neolithic and paleolithic ages in term of foods are the grains , not the meat ! i can ’ t read the language of your link . assuming it says what you say … the organic meat was pointed out to suggest that despite the absent of modern chemicals , this individual was still susceptible to heart disease and other illnesses . you ’ re saying that the grains and veggies made him ill and … short ? living in extreme cold temperatures , likely he wasn ’ t foraging nor planting . likely any plant calorie consumed came from the remnants of his prey — meaning most of his food would come from meat . that means according to your own reasoning , meat is to blame for his illness and short stature.the eskimos were at almost 100 % meat diet ( organic ) and can you make a case that they were healthy ? can you make a connection of their short stature to … plants ? if you got a hold of otzi ’ s arteries , if there was something embedded in the walls , clogging the arteries , do you think you ’ d find plant products … or cholesterol ? you are throwing a lot of misinformation around … sounds like selective confirmation bias when you read , and a need to rationalize a carnist diet … try playing puzzle and word games after eating meat , then play the same type of games after consuming nut , brazil , almonds , walnuts , and higher scores due to more brain activity ! try it , it ’ s a fact.well , we have done so much with the development of food processing and handling . it ’ s no longer the same … animals aren ’ t treated as they were back then … we are talking about mass scales of animals being “ produced ” for the human consumption . so during this process they ’ re given food and supplements that keep them alive only to have them on a plate … we give them antibiotics and we find them the cheapest “ food ” to feed them with … so yes food is different from way back then and i feel maybe the reason why it isn ’ t good for us anymore is because of the lifestyle we have and also the way the animals were raised … : - ) i wonder how this has 7 likes on this website . interesting.eating lots of plants is primal.eating a plant based diet is the future , which is here , today ! that is , if the right to life really matters . if you don ’ t eat plants , you don ’ t get the vitamins and minerals your body needs . that ’ s basic nutrition in a clean world . but , this world is neither clean nor non-toxic . and petrochemicals like benzene which are in weed killers and are carcinogenic , accumulate in the fat of animals and people . benzene rings create dioxins and organochlorine chemicals , which are persistent organic pollutants and are deadly to the body ’ s of the animal ( inc. humans ) kingdom . they increase inflammation , cancers and likely all the diseases that are out there , and they increase death at a younger age.but if you want to die , that ’ s your option . just don ’ t force others to eat as you choose.i think you ’ ve misinterpreted me . i ’ m simply stating that our ancestors ate a whole lot of plants . therefore , if one advocates the “ primal ” diet , then eat like our ancestors by eating loads of plants.cateyeblink , i agree . the “ doctor ” is pushing the dietary cholestrol myth . it has been debunked.http : / / www.fitday.com / fitness-articles / nutrition /

high.nope. you ’ re wrong . anyone following the majority of new research coming out about fat vs carbs , etc and cvd knows that the main culprit is excessive carbohydrate consumption . the consumption leads to small dense particle of ldl which is the type of ldl that attaches to artery walls . cholesterol is used by every cell in the body . it is an important nutrient and relied on heavily by the brain . studies have shown total chol levels is not a good indicator of cvd . people with low chol have just as high mortality rates then people with high chol.firstly regarding choelsterol .. “ given the capability of all tissues to synthesize sufficient amounts of cholesterol for their metabolic and structural needs , there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol . therefore , neither an adequate intake nor a recommended dietary allowance is set for cholesterol . there is much evidence to indicate a positive linear trend between cholesterol intake and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration , and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease ( chd ) . a tolerable upper intake level is not set for cholesterol because any

higher mortality rates.low-fat versus low-carbohydrate weight reduction diets effects on weight loss , insulin resistance , and cardiovascular risk : a randomized control trialthis study looked at 24 people who were overweight / obese and divided them into 2 groups . one group was low carb , high fat and the other high carb , low fat.high carb group : 20 % calories from fat / 60 % calories from carbslow carb group : 60 % calories from fat / 20 % calories from carbsin addition , the study was designed so that participants would lose 1 pound per week , so calories were reduced by 500 per day.volunteers were given pre weighed foods given as daily portions and were assessed by a dietician to make sure that they were adhering to the diet . after 8 weeks , this is what was found to be significant between the two groups . the low carb , high fat group experienced arterial stiffness which basically means impaired arterial function . what this means is that the people on this diet experienced low grade inflammation which can lead to the growth of atherosclerotic lesions and can become heart disease . “ it is possible that the high fat content of a low-carbohydrate diet exerts detrimental effects on endothelial function , which raises concerns regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of low-carbohydrate diets … currently , supported by evidence from long-term trials , we believe that a low-fat diet should remain the preferred diet for diabetes prevention . ” http : / / diabetes.diabetesjournals.org / content / 58 / 12 / 2741.longbenefit of low-fat over low-carbohydrate diet on endothelial health in obesity20 subjects participated in this study . “ the [ low carb ] diet provided 20 g of carbohydrates daily , supplemented with protein and fat content according to the atkins ’ diet recommendation.19 the [ low fat ] diet provided 30 % of the calories as fat , modeled after an american heart association diet . ” i wouldn ’ t exactly call the low fat diet “ low fat ” , but regardless , its far less fat then the low carb diet . both groups were given 750 calories less with pre made meals so they would stick with the protocol.after 6 weeks , there were significant differences between the low carb and the low fat group . the researchers performed a brachial artery test which basically tests to see if arterial function is impaired or not . typically , the arm is cut off from circulation for about 5 min . , then they release the arm , and measure how dilated the blood vessels are . if the blood vessels are constricted , it represents arterial impairment whereas dilation indicates good arterial health.on week 2 of the diet , both low carb and low fat groups had poor arterial health and were not significantly different , but by week 6 , those on the low carb diet had far worse arterial health then before , and those eating low fat had far better.this again shows that this type of diet is promoting heart disease risk.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2702133 / low-carbohydrate diets and all-cause and cause-specific mortality : two cohort studiesthis study group gathered a larger segment of the population and included “ 85,168 women ( aged 34-59 years at baseline ) and 44,548 men ( aged 40-75 years at baseline ) without heart disease , cancer , or diabetes . ” the researchers look at both low carb diets that were plant based and low carb diets that were animal based . here is what they found.low carb / animal based : higher all cause mortality risk higher risk of heart disease higher cancer riskweaker associations were found with the low carb / plant based diets . “ in our two cohorts of u.s. men and women with up to 20-26 years of follow-up , we observed that the overall low-carbohydrate diet score was only weakly associated with all-cause mortality . however , a higher animal low-carbohydrate diet score was associated with higher all-cause and cancer mortality , while a higher vegetable low-carbohydrate score was associated with lower mortality , particularly cvd mortality . ” “ these results suggest that the health effects of a low-carbohydrate diet may depend on the type of protein and fat , and that a diet including mostly vegetable sources of protein and fat is preferable to a diet with mostly animal sources of protein and fat . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2989112 / low carbohydrate-high protein diet and incidence of cardiovascular diseases in swedish women : prospective cohort studyanother study performed in europe examined another large population.participants from a random population sample , 43396 swedish women , aged 30-49 years at baseline , completed an extensive dietary questionnaire and were followed-up for an average of 15.7 years.its interesting to note that like many other studies , “ several well known patterns are evident , including the reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases with increasing level of education and physical activity and the increased risk with tobacco smoking and history of hypertension . ” the authors also point out that “ although low carbohydrate-high protein diets may be nutritionally acceptable if the protein is mainly of plant origin and the reduction of carbohydrates applies mainly to simple and refined ones , the general public do not always recognise and act on these qualifications . ” which is basically saying that complex carbohydrates from plant sources or even simple sugars from fruits are not comparable with processed carbohydrates such as white flour , added sugars and other processed carbohydrate based foods such as deserts.the aim of the study was to look at the relationship with heart disease risk and low carb diets . they used a scoring system based on how much protein and carbohydrates were consumed . the scores ranged from 2-20 . a score of 2 indicated high carbohydrate and low protein whereas a score of 20 indicates low carbohydrate and high protein.what the researchers found was that as the score increased , there was an increased rate of heart disease as demonstrated by the cut out below from table 3 . “ in practical terms , and taking into account the rough correspondence in the ranking of energy adjusted and crude tenths of intake , a 20 g decrease in daily carbohydrate intake and a 5 g increase in daily protein intake would correspond to a 5 % increase in the overall risk of cardiovascular disease . ” “ with respect to the biomedical plausibility of our findings , vegetables , fruits , cereals , and legumes , which have been found in several studies to be core components of healthy dietary patterns , 34 35 are important sources of carbohydrates , so that reduced intake of these food groups is likely to have adverse effects on cardiovascular health . moreover , several studies have reported that meat consumption or high intake of protein from animal sources may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3383863 / low-carbohydrate – high-protein diet and long-term survival in a general population cohortanother european cohort study examined data from 2,944 greeks . the aim of the study was to see whether low carb diets had a strong relationship with all cause mortality . the study notes that low carb diets are popular for weight loss , but they also note that other diets such as zone , weight watchers and the ornish diet as well as the atkins diet all produced similar weight loss after 1 year . “ it is , thus , of considerable interest , to examine whether prolonged consumption of lc / hp diets is compatible with long-term health . ” here is what the study classified as low carbohydrate : 20 % carbs , 25 % protein , 55 % fathere is what is classified as high carbohydrate : 50 % carbohydrate , 10 % protein and 40 % fat.although both diets are very high fat when compared to a healthier , lower fat diet , we are examining the effect of reducing carbohydrate consumption . it is also important to note that we also don ’ t know what the majority of the carbohydrate sources were , as they could be highly processed . nonetheless , here are the results.in all model tests performed in the study , low carbohydrate / high protein diets had a strong positive relationship with mortality . models 1 and 2 did not control for calories.model 1 : “ increasing protein intake was significantly associated with total mortality , whereas increasing carbohydrate intake was associated with nonsignificant reduction of this mortality . ” model 2 : “ the [ low carb , high protein ] score ( absolute values ) was positively associated with mortality , although the association did not reach statistical significance ” models 3 and 4 controlled for calories , but model 3 did not control for complimentary changes in calories when either protein or carbohydrates are reducedmodel 3 : “ mortality was significantly associated with reduction of energy-adjusted carbohydrate intake and nonsignificantly with increasing protein intake . ” model 4 shows the most compelling results as it accounted for calories and changes in the low carb , high protein score were unrelated to caloric intake.model 4 : “ in this model , increasing lc / hp score was significantly associated with mortality … it is worth noting that in all these models mortality tends to be inversely associated with intake of unsaturated lipids and positively , although not always significantly , with saturated lipids.what they find from this data is that “ an increase of protein intake by about 15 g / day and a decrease of carbohydrate intake by about 50 g / day ) was associated with a 22 % increase in overall mortality ” “ in conclusion , we have found evidence that dietary patterns that indiscriminate focus on low intake of carbohydrates in general and high intake of proteins in general , and reflect diets that have been frequently recommended for weight reduction , may be associated with increased total mortality if they are pursued for extended periods . ” http : / / folk.ntnu.no / lyngbakk / artikler / trichopoulou.pdflow carbohydrate , high fat diet increases c-reactive protein during weight loss.unfortunately , i was unable to find the full text of this study so it is difficult for me to view the details and all i can do is base my conclusions of the study based on the abstract which is not something i like to do . regardless , the study revealed a very interesting finding . it showed that when subjects of the study went on a low carb , high protein diet for 4 weeks , they had a 25 % increase in c-reactive protein . c-reactive protein is a marker of inflammation which basically means that this group of people were promoting the development of a chronic disease . in contrast , the high carbohydrate subjects decreased their levels of c-reactive protein by 48 % .http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17536128low carbohydrate – high protein diet and mortality in a cohort of swedish womenwe go back to the swedish cohort study and examine overall mortality as opposed to just cardiovascular risk . the study looked at 42,237 women for 12 years . what they found was this , the higher the protein intake , the higher the mortality and inversely with carbohydrate intake . the higher the fat , both saturated and unsaturated , the higher the mortality rate . and most importantly , the authors note , higher mortality was not correlated with energy intake . the authors note “ increased protein intake and decreased carbohydrate intake appear to be equally unfavourable for cardiovascular mortality ” the data shows that both heart disease and cancer rates increase when consuming a lower carb , high protein diet . “ after fine controlling for all assessed mortality risk factors that could act as confounding variables , as well as for total energy and saturated fat intake , women with lower intake of total carbohydrates and higher intake of total proteins , in comparison to those with higher intake of total carbohydrates and lower intake of total proteins , had significantly higher total mortality and , in particular , cardiovascular mortality . ” http : / / onlinelibrary.wiley.com / doi / 10.1111 / j.1365-2796.2007.01774.x / fullcomparative effects of three popular diets on lipids , endothelial function , and c-reactive protein during weight maintenancethis study is quite interesting . it examined 18 adults aged 20 or over for 6 months . the aim of the study was to examine their health when on 3 diets , the atkins diet ( high fat , low carb ) , the south beach diet ( mediterranean ) and the ornish diet ( low fat , high carb ) . they found no significant differences between the 3 diets in terms of calories consumed . the results are interesting as seen in the figure below.they found higher ldl in the atkins diet and lower ldl in the low fat ornish diet . they also found significantly higher levels of c-reactive protein in the atkins diet as opposed to the ornish diet . what was also found was that the atkins diet had poor results for the brachial artery test which again shows impaired arterial function . “ high saturated fat intake may adversely impact lipids and endothelial function during weight maintenance . as such , popular diets such as atkins may be less advantageous for chd risk reduction when compared to the ornish and south beach diets ” http : / / engine2diet.com / usrfiles / files / publishedstudies / obesity / comparative-effects-of-3-diets.pdfit is interesting to note that total cholesterol decreased on an ornish diet including hdl , and that the triglycerides increased on an ornish diet.a review examining 108 randomized control trials found this . “ this systematic review and meta-regression analysis of 108 randomised controlled trials using lipid modifying interventions did not show an association between treatment mediated change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events , coronary heart disease deaths , or total deaths whenever change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol was taken into account . we found a statistically significant , substantial association between change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events , coronary heart disease deaths , or total deaths ” “ our findings contribute to accumulating evidence that simply increasing the amount of circulating high density lipoprotein cholesterol does not necessarily confer cardiovascular benefits ” they also note that hdl that is dysfunctional and pro inflammatory may be produced under certain dietary conditions , “ recent data suggest that a low fat , high fibre diet , in combination with exercise , converts high density lipoprotein cholesterol from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state . ” conclusion : “ available data suggest that simply increasing the amount of circulating high density lipoprotein cholesterol does not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease events , coronary heart disease deaths , or total deaths . the results support reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol as the primary goal for lipid modifying interventions . ” http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2645847 / another study examining the effects the different lipids in terms of heart disease risk found that “ triglyceride concentration was not independently related with chd risk after controlling for hdl-c , non – hdl-c , and other standard risk factors , including null findings in women and under nonfasting conditions.21,22 hence , for population-wide assessment of vascular risk , triglyceride measurement provides no additional information about vascular risk given knowledge of hdl-c and total cholesterol levels , although there may be separate reasons to measure triglyceride concentration ( eg , prevention of pancreatitis ) . ” http : / / jama.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ? articleid = 184863in addition , please see here http : / / nutritionfacts.org /

win ! ! ! not only is a plant based diet not a scam , but it is no longer primal . it is the future unless you want to be on drugs for the rest of your shorter life of eating meat ( flesh ) , eggs , and dairy . if you want to avoid most recombinant dna in foods , you can grow your own vegan foods in your backyard . on the other hand , if genetically modified crap doesn ’ t bother you . enjoy the recombinant dna in pharmaceuticals of all kinds in the usa.looking at the side effects of drugs like boniva and other drugs that supposedly build bone , they significantly increase pain . i do not want to go there . eating the large quantities of calcium from yogurt and dairy that i had eaten all my life did nothing to keep my bones strong as i approached the age of 65 . what they did was increase my body size – not my bone size . and , when i fractured my spine this year , they increased my pain.i can eat a quart size pan full of collard greens and not even come near the calories of drinking a quart of milk , but have more calcium . now granted , i love milk – organic milk that is . but , even organic , low fat milk has cholesterol , and much more . it has low levels of dioxins , organochlorine pesticides and other fat soluble chemicals that collect and concentrate in my body fat and increase the risk of cancer , immune system damage , and a whole host of diseases . and , with corporations today changing the dna of food seeds of plants fed to livestock to make the seeds resist more herbicides including roundup , ( agent orange ) 2,4-d ( which the bush-cheney epa admitted is contaminated with 2,3,7,8 tcdd dioxin – the most toxic form of dioxin ever inadvertently created by mankind ) , dicamba ( also contaminated with dioxins ) and other toxic pesticides , which are building up in the air ( according to the u.s.g.s. ) come back to earth with the rain ( and snow ) , and build up in animals and people who top the food chain . why are you eating meat , dairy , eggs and poisoning yourself ? ? ? ? ? i tried to get my dog to eat vegetarian before she died . unfortunately , the vet took her off the food that was making her better and put her on the food that killed her.the only way to eat and survive is a plant based diet.you are beyond ridiculous.troll alert ! really so your saying doctor greger has no life he has nothing else better to do if really a scam you may as well call him a mass murderer i am sensing your eating to much meat and i never applied any of this fully it is just common sense there is no way that every single study and all test test the people and the countries involved are consider a scam . what an absurd claim obviously this is the comment from a brain that is clouded with toxins.fantastic presentation dr.greger ! ! ! ! i have not watched anything more smarter than that , in my life ! my admiration and respect ! ! absolutely mind-blowing ! i have shared this video , and others , so many times i cannot count . i would like to share with you , that at least four people that i know of have become vegetarian and working towards vegan because of it . thank you.in this june 3 2013 jama adventist 2 results , why the seafood vegetarian living longer than vegan ? http : / / archinte.jamanetwork.com / article.aspx ? articleid = 1691919if you look at the overlapping confidence intervals , you can see the study is not ( yet ) able to differentiate between the different classes of “ vegetarians . ” as the researchers write in the discussion , they ’ re hoping to be able to do direct comparisons between vegetarian groups in a much anticipated later follow-up . the cohort ’ s only been followed for about 6 years , and so far the only main take-home we can tease out is that all classes of “ vegetarians ” clumped together live longer than even the healthy meateaters tracked in the study ( adventist vegetarians live up to 10 years longer than regular meateaters ) . another major goal they describe is to study specific causes of mortality and associations with specific foods within the broader dietary patterns – exciting stuff ! this is the third time of watching it ! i don ’ t mind that this video is long as it sums up all the reasons into one video on why to eat plant based . this video is powerful ! i want to remember all the facts so when people who don ’ t understand why i want to eat this way i can give them facts that they can ’ t argue with ! thankyou for your hard work , jess : ) ive only watched half of this so far but i think its gonna change my life after @ 10 years of huge fast food weight gain after some life trauma … and not knowing how to get back on track … . go paleo ? vegan ? is grain bad ? etc etc . no longer feeling conflicted and hopeless . thanksguest : i ’ m so glad you aren ’ t feeling so conflicted and hopeless . i agree that once someone is exposed to this information , it is compelling.just in case you didn ’ t know it , dr. greger has released 2 other summary videos . if you managed to get through this one and want to check out the other two , here they are : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / from-table-to-able / well worth your time and effort . with each video , i suspect that you will feel more and more confident about your choices . good luck and let us know if you need any how-to suggestions.try not to get overwhelmed . drink more spring water , eat more fruits and nuts .. start slowly and you will notice the difference. take the doctors advice and try eating plant based . i feel amazing ! so go for it.hello dr. michael greger ! since i became a vegan more than a year ago some of my friends and family started to get worried about my health . they think that humans need animal products to be healthy so i made this compilation video which proves once and for all that vegan diet ( or rather a plant-based diet ) is the healthiest diet for human beings . i ’ ve been thinking on making a video about how awesome you are as well so this video mostly involves you and the great work you ’ ve done ! thank you for everything that you are doing ! we are really lucky to have you on our side ! https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = 7mr7bm8ubaaberkay : nice video . it can be so * hard * when you do not have support of family and friends . sometimes you are fighting ignorance . sometimes you are fighting those who have their own internal conflicts . i bet making that video was cathartic.if possible , you might also want to reach out to plant-based groups in your area . having some friends in your life who already “ get it ” can be a huge help . just an idea . if you are interested , you might start with searching for a group through the meetup site . good luck.dr. greger , thank you very much for uploading this video . i ’ ve really been wanting to see a live presentation by you for a long time , but haven ’ t been able to get out to any of them . i can ’ t wait to watch this info-jam-packed video ! thank you again . ooh , is that a cup of tea in your avatar ? good choice ! hopefully not coffee with milk ! ! thank you so much for posting this ! so wonderful that it ’ s free ! hi ! i ’ ve been raw vegan for 13 years ( in august ) and have just come across your work ( via ruth heindrich ) . absolutely love it and will share , share , share with as many people as i can . thank you so much for all that you are doing xdr . greger , i realize that you have so much science to cover each year and , as you indicate , this undoubtedly puts a lot of strain on your available time and resources . i believe that your website has the potential to be a unique place to discuss the latest science . i feel , however , that the discussion component would be more meaningful if greater effort could be devoted to addressing scientific questions and comments from readers . i have followed all of your videos and read many of the background articles . regrettably , however , relatively few of the concerns that i have about the science have ever been addressed.i hope that you take this feedback in the spirit of improving an already great website.possibly the best presentation ever.loaded with amazing information — lots of things stood out to me , like how our body cannot defend against the endotoxins ; i mean , we ’ re not vultures ! it ’ s seems so common sense.and i found it interesting that vegan men have higher testosterone ? did i hear that right ? that goes against what so many men think , since testosterone = “ manly-men ” in their minds . it seems that belief is so prevalent . men seem so afraid of being unmanly , and vegetables = wimp , vegan = weak ; while meat = virility . i mean all the meaty commercials make it so sexy … gotta have it ! they ’ ll go to their graves with meat in their cold dead mouths ! sexist thinking abounds . ( read carol j. adams , sexual politics of meat if interested ; it ’ s fascinating ) so much great info ; i do love that the studies are getting so specific now ! it ’ s getting harder for detractors to blow off the facts ! a thousand thank you ’ s , dr. greger . when are you coming to los angeles ? ! ! hi — i am a vegan animal activist and took the time to watch today ’ s video . i ’ ve been hearing more and more anecdotal stories about people “ waking up ” to the vegan message and being motivated pretty much solely by the health factor . if vegans could get their vegan-reluctant friends and families to take the time to watch this video it , i think it will blow their minds , like it did mine ( and i ’ m already vegan ) .i am fired up to get this information out into the airwaves somehow . i do have a 1 / 2 hour show called “ glass walls ” on queens public access tv ( and i also know two other people who have shows on public access ) and would like to know if i could get a dvd or a tape of it . a sonydvcam tape is the required format at qptv ( and being a total newbie at tv editing and production i have had many obstacles because of it ) but any format you could supply i will try to work with to get it aired.thanks dr. greger … i think the time is ripening that people ’ s ears will be perking up to your educational efforts.dr. greger , i think you might be off a little on the leading cause of death . as far as i can tell , birth is the leading cause of death . : ) . just having fun . thanks for all you do.stevebest presentation that i have seen . dr. greger thank you so much ! the best time investment i have done . thank you for exposing us to this compilation of science-based information.my exact sentiments , wendy ! ! you people are nuts . no offense , love you , but you ’ re nuts.i agree cateyeblink , primal / paleo is the only way to get healthier . the “ only way ” ? clearly , that is debatable and depends on your definition of healthy ( see links below ) . at the moment , it seems that there is no one and “ only way to get healthier ” . that in actuality , there may be many ways to eat to get healthier and be healthy.if the goal is preventing and treating disease by way of diet , it seems clear from the currently available scientific evidence that some diets are better at preventing and treating disease than others . it just so happens that “ the balance of scientific evidence suggests that the healthiest way to eat [ to prevent and treat disease ] is a vitamin b12-fortified diet of whole plant foods ” . at the moment , it seems that there is not enough evidence to indicate that other diets are capable of preventing and treating disease to the same degree that a plant-based diet can for most people . moreover , i think it is also debatable whether a meat-based primal / paleo diet is a sensible and healthy way to eat for the planet … but that is discussion for another forum.http : / / www.npr.org / blogs / 13.7 / 2011 / 10 / 27 / 141666659 / the-paleo-diet-not-the-way-to-a-healthy-futurehttp : / / www.theatlantic.com / health / archive / 2011 / 07 / the-paleo-diet-caveman-cure-all-or-unhealthy-fad / 242621 / # whole food chomper , well said . this video has attracted many of the paleo proponents . i also recommend this free e book written by dr. greger which thoroughly refutes this fancy “ atkins ” diet.http : / / www.atkinsexposed.org / as a wholistic healthcare practitioneri always ask anyone picking up a statin in the retail setting if anyone told them to avoid partially hydrogenated oil . many have not even heard of it . i explain what it is , how it ’ s formed , how to avoid it and which other oils to use.oops blinked and you missed it ; ) seriously , if that ’ s all you have to say with no proof whatsoever , you ’ re just blowing steam.thanks so much for this full-length video ! what a great surprise ! i keep thinking that the us will some day reach a tipping-point , and the meat myths will come tumbling down , but it never seems to happen . in answering people ’ s questions regarding my diet , i have changed my tactics , somewhat . as a way to appeal to their innate selfishness , i tell them that i don ’ t care what anyone else eats , as long as i can have the best for myself . i don ’ t need the best car , the best home , or the best telephone on the market , but they can ’ t take my veggies from me ! that ’ s sacred ! thanks again ! i bought this on amazon and was so excited about it but couldn ’ t figure out how to share it with everybody i know . you have solved that . thank you ! oh good , nice to know it can be bought on amazon . thx for that info kristen ! yes and i think proceeds go to charity . : ) i bought mine from this website a few weeks ago … proceeds to charity … loved this video ! ! ! ! it really is life-changing and life-saving as someone else has asserted ! would a plant based high protein diet cause igf-1 elevated ? is this the same igf-1 from animal protein diet ? kay there is some debate from dr. mcdougall that isolated soy proteins raise igf-1 levels even more so than milk . search mcdougall igf1 at youtube , he has a video . so if you are making the effort with a plant based diet , it makes sense to stay away from highly processed soy . but regular soy cakes are fine . hi kay , igf-1 is elevated by a variety of causes . casein the predominant protein in dairy causes a rise and protein free diets cause a decrease . so not consuming excess protein seems to be a good idea . there is a difference between animal and plant protein but many similarities as well animal protein generally contains more sulfur based amino acids then plant protein but they all contain the same essentials amino acids . the body uses what it needs but then eliminates the rest . tthere is no way you can not get enough protein and the essential amino acids you need if you consume adequate calories . it seems like it is wise not making a point of eating alot of protein rich foods . the best referenced information on protein that i have seen can be found in articles in dr. john mcdougalls three newsletters dated 12 / 03 , 1 / 04 and 4 / 07 . you can find these by going to his websites and looking up the newsletters . the articles are on protein history , where do i get my protein and protein overload . hope this helps . plant protein does not raise igf-1 levels , only animal proteins have this negative effect on our bodies . if you get a chance to hear any of dr t colin campbell ’ s lectures or amazing discoveries , dr walter veith , they clearly present the evidence that animal proteins are the culprits in cancer and disease proliferation . check them out.do you know if the results are the same whether it ’ s organic / grass fed animals or factory farmed animals ? extremely generous michael . thank you . wonderful information . life changing . life saving ! ! ! don ’ t forget to 5-star this video , folks ! ! ! : ^ ) nutritionfacts.org by dr. mercola , is the best information on nutrition . i started watching it based on a recommendation by non other than dr. mcdougall . wouldn ’ t it be great if we could get this particular video shown in every high-school in america and every other country.methinks you meant dr. greger . puhlease … not mercola.not mercola , greger . big big big difference ! thanks a lot dr. greger , always a pleasure.amazing presentation – thank you ! wonderful – ! thank you dr greger this is just fabulous ! thanks , mike ! i share you with everyone ! ! this video is as entertaining as it is informative , as are all your videos ! thank you so much , dr gregor ! ! we spoke in golden , co . thank you , i ’ m so happy to now be able to share this ! ✿ ¸ . • ° * ” ˜ ƹӝʒ ˜ ” * ° • . • . ¸ ღ ¸ ☆ ´ ¸ . ✿ ´ ´ ¯ ' • . ¸ ¸ . ི ♥ ྀ .

i hope it saves many people from suffering diseases and ill health . i only wish this information was taught in every school around the globe.thank you for making this excellent speech available to all . i will share it with all who will listen . i live a plant strong , vegan life and feel wonderful ! i gotta say as a meat eater , i will seriously try to cut back to just fish and see how i can break the habits . i enjoyed watching you immensely , you ’ re hilarious : ) dr g. , i remember a few years ago john mcdougall talked about higher igf-1 concentrations in isolated soy protein ( in shakes , faux meats , protein bars , etc . ) . has this been borne out over time ? if you look at the chapter list for my volume 10 dvd you ’ ll see it ’ s coming up – stay tuned ! how i wish you had more time for the quiz show format dr. greger ! i am so grateful to have listened to your presentation ! you clearly draw a line between the diet fads and the hidden truth in clinical nutrition ! kudos to you ! this is one of the most outstanding presentations . i watch the daily presentations each day . i have thought how nice it would be to have a summary of health promoting lifestyle is this manner . i hope you will do this again in the future with future research . i will forward this to many . thanks.fabulous video ! thanks again for all your great work ! brilliant ! thanks so much for posting this , dr. greger . it should be required viewing by every north american . your comic timing and sense of irony are superb . thanks for doing what you do.brilliant , eye opening presentation ! ! ! thanks for your great work ! you are fabulous . special thanks to kristensraw.com who introduced me to your videos and website . your information and delivery is outstanding . after watching your video … someone has to have a screw loose if they eat meat and dairy … i will always follow you … dr. greger , according to buddhism , vegan can have lower accidence . i just want to be a vegan by my own feeling , not necessary by scientific proof . but i know public need such proof . thanks for video ! thank you , dr greger . in short , this is the best informational video on diet and nutrition with scientific basis … and a great way to share with others . thank you for your dedication and passion in this effort.this was so informative video that convinced me going back to vegan diet again . i have been following vegetarian diet for two years and i became vegan almost one year ago . but i have started to consume cheese and foods which has egg and milk in them ( such as cakes , chocolate with milk , coffe with cream , ice cream … ) . after 3 months of enjoying with all these sugary and milky foods , i started to feel effects of this diet not just in my body but also on my mind . thus , i was thinking about going back to vegan diet and your video made me take this decision with no question . thnaks a lot ! : ) you cite a study that uses people eating an egg mcmuffin as proof that eggs and meat cause inflammation ? seriously ? how about a study where people eat high-quality foods instead of a preservative rich product of “ meat ” and “ eggs ” with a big ol ’ gluten chaser ? getting inflammation from an egg mcmuffin proves one thing : egg mcmuffin sandwiches are bad for you . eggs are thoroughly covered in this website and there is an abundance of information on eggs presented here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ? s = eggsyou rock dr. gregor ! i really enjoy your videos . you have made such a difference in my life , and my family ’ s life . your videos are inspiring , engaging and informative . viewing them has helped me stay focused on staying true to my plant-based values ! dr greger , that was one of the most comprehensive nutrition videos i have ever seen ! amazing ! thank you so much ! best lecture on veganism ever heard ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 1a wicked awesome video dr. g ! but what is a vegan with cholesterol around 250 to do to get it down to 150 ? w ” hat about inuits ( eskimos ) and what do all american olympic athletes live on ? hi angela , i just read 2 really good books on this topic written by 2 athletes who are vegan endurance athletes.eat and run by scott jurek and ultraman by rich roll . they train and compete hours and hours a day on a vegan diet.evidence indicates that modern-day inuits ( eskimos ) , suffer from heart disease and other forms of atherosclerosis ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 16997359 ) , and that modern-day hunter-gathers who base their diets on plant foods are free of such diseases . also , osteoporosis ( http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 4412233 ) , is an epidemic among meat and fish consuming hunter-gathers , specifically the inuits . it seems that olympic athletes live on a variety of diets : http : / / www.fitsugar.com / weird-diets-olympic-athletes-24190955http : / / www.huffingtonpost.ca / 2012 / 07 / 24 / olympic-athletes-diets _ n _ 1696366.htmlhttp : / / www.telegraph.co.uk / sport / olympics / olympic _ infographics _ and _ data / 9397299 / olympics-2012-team-gb-athletes-diets-interactive.htmlreferring to your last paragraph , i am in my 80th year . since the age of 17 i followeed a wholefood vegetarian diet . as a result , i am sure , i had ‘ flu once as an adult and have no regular aches and pains . i haven ’ t had a cold for over 10 years . although quite good at athletics as a kid , this did not carry into my adult life . i was active in business , and took moderate exercise , including for many years , about 4 hours dancing every night . at many points , including now , i have felt that i am having the best time of my life , which seems to indicate that my physical and mental well-being is ok . i notice other peoples ’ lives a lot and have a real feeling that my life has been the happiest that i have ever considered , far far happier than many of the famous and wealthy people about whom we can read.mike : i ’ ve seen your recent posts on this site and wanted to thank you for sharing your experiences . while i am late to the game compared to you , you have inspired me.sadly having trouble hearing this. seems to have two commentaries running at once . help please. blessings annie and the animals . want to be able to pass this on to mynetwork . you have probably clicked on it twice so have two versions running . shut it down totally and try again.dr gregor , you ’ re the bomb ! i ’ ll bet the meat industry is quaking in their muck boots at this very moment ! ; - ) god bless and keep up your great work ! thanks for sharing this excellent presentation with us ! love the piggy pic ! oink ! i like more people become vegan , then apples and berries would lower down the price as cheap as chicken ! people hesitate to become vegan , because the only advantage of meat is easily to satisfy people at the moment . people usually notice the moment feeling rather than feel the future impact . as to me , i am used to be a vegetarian , so usually i can feel irratation soon after eating meat . trust our own feeling , not only depend on scientific proof , which is easily to be disputed by a narrow view . i believe housefly can work for the food , but it can also bring some unknown bad thing . .. i like banana very much , but it contains high potassium , kidney disease people can not consume a lot … i guess milk is good for replenishment temporary for malnutrition , but is not good for long period consumption … i was always confident about my choice but now i have even better medical support because of your video . but the irony is that the most ‘ annoying ’ people who don ’ t agree with me are from medical environment ( my relative who is ex-nurse , one friend who studies medicine ) . they are too narrow-minded and sceptical about it because they olny belive in what they are / were tought . it ’ such a shame that my med-student-friend even sent me one picture in which there are religious symbols on the right and the phrase ‘ belief ’ and science on the left and phrases like ‘ arguments , experiment ’ . and she said that i am on the right side of this picture because i am vegan ! ! ! when i sent neal barnard and colin campbell videos she refused to watch them saying that this is all fraud . and she is the future doctor ! ! ! and not interested in these topics ! recently i drove back home with my relative ex-nurse who offered me some milk-and-egg filled cookies , i politely refused and she said : ‘ oh , you ’ re still following your abnormal diet ! ’ and looking at me with disapproval . and that ’ s me who never eats chemical foods ( even vegan ones ) , i aim at low-fat , low-oil , low-salt organic natural foods , and that ’ s me who being abnormal … and healthier than all of them .. * okay face * . well , i ’ m learning to stand for my choices too , recently my family and i were in one town which is popular for its meat , we decided to eat in a cafe , and everything they had in the menu was with various kinds of meat , dairy sauces or pizzas with cheese . i said that i wished some vegetables and potatoes , waitress said that they serve that only with meat and there is no seperate price for it . when i told her i ’ m not meat-eater she was confused but in the end i got what i wanted . i guess i ’ m used to being ‘ crazy ’ among ‘ normal ’ people and i ’ m even starting to like it ! : ) angela : thank you for sharing your story . i was getting frustrated just listening about your relatives . i can just imagine what it must be like to have to deal with them personally . good for you for being the one to actually stick to the science.it ’ s not only due to personality , dear . if someone give me videos about we must eat meat , i will refuse too . am i stubborn ? maybe , but , obviously we have been always fooled by allerged scientific proof ! however , true wolf comes this time ! thank you so much for posting this entire video ! thank you very much dr. greger ! i really admire your work ! thank you for sharing this educational and entertaining video . i ’ m vegan and working to open the eyes of my extended family . i think i ’ ll pay them to watch this video ! you rock ! ! you are the best ! ! i noticed that the first few minutes have been edited out since i first saw the video . it showed the warm , warm welcome that the audience gave you when you first took the mike . you deserved that , and i ’ m glad i saw the original version before editing took place.thank you so much for uploading it ! i am a dialysis nurse and am completely dismayed at how much animal protein our ( non-veg ) dieticians are telling our patients to eat ! they could be suggesting some quinoa instead ! anyway , love listening to your videos.magnificent ! i have been on a vegan diet for a couple years after reading colin campbell ’ s “ the china study . ” this video gives me a lot more ammunition , thank you ! love this video ! so amazing ! i am so glad there are websites like this . i am sharing this video wherever i can . thank you ! have no compassion for those murderers who kill animals and eat their corpses. if they stop and become vegan , then they are welcomed to the humanity. else. let them die sooner. better for animals . ( they dont get murdered ) better for corpse eaters ( they are dead – so – they create less karma for their miserable souls . ) win win.speaking of that i read today in the paper that the meat industry went crazy this week when the usda recommended to its employees to try a meatless monday in a memo . they took the memo down after complaints from the meat industry . a executive called it treason and said who ever was involved in that memo should be fired ! could you share a link to that article with us ? i saw that article too ! here ’ s the story if you don ’ t mind someone else answering , just trying to help : http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com / 2012 / 07 / 26 / usda-meatless-monday-post _ n _ 1705113.html hi ! just curious , when you compare the effects of cholesterol from a single egg a day to 5 cigarettes a day for 15 years , did you mean the single egg a day for 15 years as well or was the duration different ? love your work ! the way i understood it was ” one egg per day for your whole life was the equivalent to 5 cigarettes a day for 15 years ” i really enjoyed this . i became a pesco veggie person , thought i ’ d try it , and you know , i do feel better ! incredible nutritional fodder . thank you ! loving your presentations , your humor and so glad to have another highly respected physician backing my nutritional soapbox.incredible nutritional fodder . thank you ! loving your presentations , your humor and so glad to have another highly respected physician backing my nutritional soapbox.nice ! thanks ! what does the vegan diet look like that is being referred to ? can you cook the veggies ? i want to change my eating habits but honestly i can just eat raw lettus and a strip of carrot … dr. greger does not recommend any specific type of vegan diet . overall , he recommends a balanced diet that is low fat , whole grain , and plant-based ( that is , non-meat – this includes poultry / fish / eggs – , non-dairy , whole grains , mostly fruits and veggies ( cooked or raw ) . ( in fact , it is better to eat your veggies cooked than raw most of the time … see dr. g ’ s video on the topic . ) there are many plant-based ways to eat . to go vegan , is not that difficult really , but like all changes it takes time and getting used to until it sticks . there are so many wonderful resources out there that can guide you along the way . like dr. barnard ’ s “ 21 day vegan kickstart program ” . http : / / www.21daykickstart.org / i also really like nutritionmd a lot as well . loads of information about nutrition , recipes , and how to construct a vegan grocery shopping list ( and so much more ) . http : / / www.nutritionmd.org / index.html you may also want to read jack norris and virginia messina ’ s _ vegan for life : everything you need to know to be healthy and fit on a plant-based diet _ .also , check out dr. greger ’ s “ optimum nutrition recommendations ” : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-greger % e2 % 80 % 99s-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / a trip to the library or bookstore , or a good search on the internet , should yield a plethora of information on plant-based / vegan resources . you may want to start here : http : / / www.veganhealth.org / http : / / www.peta.org / living / default.aspx http : / / www.cok.net / http : / / www.meatoutmondays.org / 7days.htm http : / / www.humanesociety.org / issues / eating / recipes / http : / / www.pcrm.org http : / / www.drmcdougall.com http : / / www.drfuhrman.com / http : / / www.pmri.org http : / / www.tcolincampbell.org http : / / www.heartattackproof.com wishing you and your son the best of health ! cooking foods increases absorbtion , but this is the price we pay for decreased amount of enzymes . cooked òver 40 degrees = dead ( plants or meat ) , raw = live , as for myself , i feel a lot better on raw food than on cooked , but it requires a lot of eating , a lot of time to get enough energy , if i had nothing to do i would always eat raw food , but now i eat steamed veggies and potatoes if i have no time for buying kilos of fruits.personally , i like practical diets as well . can ’ t just sit at home and eat all day . by far , the best part of plant-based eating is not having to count calories , fat , etc . that , and knowing that my body is being powered with goodness with each bite that i take . knowing that i am easing the burden on the planet and the suffering of animals and meat processing workers is a pretty grand feeling as well . : ) very interesting and informative . thank you dr. greger ! thank you so much for posting this video ! ! ! thoroughly enjoyed it ! a question for you – i recently watched this presentation by dr. mcdougal : http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = mhyfojbu434 . he discusses igf-1 and states that while dairy raises igf-1 , soy protein isolate raises it even moreso . what is your opinion about this ? soy protein isolates are as the name suggests the protein taken out of the soy bean . this is processed not a whole food so should be either avoided or very limited. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-much-soy-is-too-much / highly recommended ! “ uprooting the leading causes of death ” is worth watching all the way through . thank you , dr. gregor , for bringing to light many scientific studies and articles i only learned about because of your video.best video ever ! thank you ! this is fabulous ! finally , the truth – not only the amazing value of a vegan diet , but the cherry on top – an exposé of governmental leader ’ s personal interest at the cost of public interest at its finest . kudos ! ! ! and thanks . i ’ ve been longing to hear these words for a long time.great video ! being vegan for 11 years , it just confirms my choice everyday ! though , i was wondering what are the leading cause of death among vegans . are there any statistics on that ? was any of this research done on organic grass fed animal products or just factory farmed animals ? just wondering if the results would be any different.most of the issues in animal products are due to inherent compounds such as cholesterol , xenoestrogens , endotoxins and other substances . even if the meats were clear of contaminants , these compounds are inherent of meat and cannot be separated.was this at summerfest in milwaukee ? amazing , thank you ! i think this was a great video , everyone should see iti absolutely loved this video . i actually recently started moving toward a plant based diet and trying very hard to get my teen , family and friends to follow suit . : ) i have shared this video with all of my facebook friends and will continue to do so . ( i apologize for running my comments together . i am unsure if hitting the return key will get me a new paragrapgh or cause an unfinished statement to be sent . ) seems to me that your favor of the vegan diet overlooks the significantly overwhelming evidences of poor quality ( unhealthy ) foods generally available in north america . there is unwise , ignorant use of harmful pesticides , insecticides , over-farmed soil , and artificially and inadequately enhanced soil . common farming practices are based on doing what produces the most abundant and attractive , without doing what is best for the health of people , who will eat the produce , and that of the animals and farmed fish ( which people will , also , eat ) . if those who can afford truly organic produce and meat / poultry / fish would buy them , then more farmers would see the market exists , and follow better , healthier practices . also , if more people reduced their dependence on low-nutritional-value , boxed foods , and greatly increased their intake of healthy , organic produce there could be better heath , in general . ultimately , there is no “ magic ” formula for individual health and longevity , considering the death rate is 100 % , and we don ’ t get to choose our genes.such a great talk , thank you so much for sharing and i love what you are doing ! dr. gregor , it was a treat ! i hope i ’ ll be able to pass this very informative and fanny as hell lecture to some my omnivore friends . thank you so much ! thank you dr m greger for this priceless information which i will share – thank you also for your exemplary and entertaining delivery ! thank you dr m greger for this priceless information which i will share – thank you also for your exemplary and entertaining delivery ! commercially raised meat is no different than any other processed food . of course it ’ s going to be bad for you . same with commercially raised eggs , and fish , and all the rest of the food you say is bad . grass raised , hormone and antibiotic free animals do not have the same meat composition as feedlot animals and there is science to back that up . perhaps the problem isn ’ t so much in the meat , but in what the meat eats before we eat it . grain is not a natural staple for a cow or a chicken . : ) dr. greger , thank you for the excellent video ! i think it would be helpful if you can copy all the sources cited in this video from all the separate videos where they are included to here . it would be much easier to find the relevant sources this way . great idea ! if you or anyone else would be up for copy / pasting , please email volunteers @ nutritionfacts.orgi recently watched the recent video titled “ uprooting the leading causes of death ” . i thought it was a very facinating video , but it left me with some questions . we have recently cut a significant portion of meat out of our diet to where we may eat meat only once or twice a week and still consume eggs , milk , and cheese fairly regularly . i have not yet been ready to take the full plunge of being a full vegetarian or a vegan . you mentioned a number of different studies that showed the differences between vegans and meat eaters . do the studies tell what types of meat was eaten in these surveys ? is there any difference in results in eating different types of meat ? is it all the same ? for example are the results the same for eating organic grass fed beef as they are for eating irradiated , hormone and additive filled , altered beef ? would the results be the same for eating venison or wild game such as turkey , dove , and quail as opposed to beef , chicken , or pork ? would the studies regarding dairy be different if all the participant had only goat or sheep milk or chees instead of cow ’ s ? is there a difference between goat , sheep , and cow milk and cheese ? are there any studies showing differences between raw organic cow or goat milk as opposed to processed pasturized and homogenized milks and cheeses ? is there any study to show whether or not better quality animal protiens and fats would produce better results ? by better quality , i mean without pesticides , herbicides , chemical additives , not grown in a lab , etc . basically it comes down to the questions of “ are all animal protiens and fats the same ? do they all produce the same results ? ” thanks , – christopherall of this nutrition crap isnt goin to help anyone since the government is trying to reduce the population by any means neccesary.regarding the comparison of eggs and smoking as derived from the nurses study , this would apply to meat eaters . this is a major shortcoming of that study ; the results might be very different for those on a plant based diet . you follow a fad diet my friend . there is no real science to support such a diet . following the carbohydrates are bad bandwagon is simply false http : / / www.atkinsexposed.org / according to this , the average life expectancy in some parts of india must be > 200 years ! dear dr. greger , it seems from the 1999 meta analysis study below that vegans do not live any longer than meat eaters but that vegetarians live longer than both meat eaters and vegans . just as surprising is that the number one nutrition related cause for vegan deaths was heart disease followed by strokes and then cancer ! how can this be ? can you explain ? terrific website ! thank you , edsummary : http : / / www.veganhealth.org / articles / dxratesactual research : key tj , fraser ge , thorogood m , appleby pn , beral v , reeves g , burr ml , chang-claude j , frentzel-beyme r , kuzma jw , mann j , mcpherson k. mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians : detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies . am j clin nutr . 1999 sep ; 70 ( 3 suppl ) : 516s-524sthank you for this important information ! ! yess ! ! we want to prevent not decrease risk of atherosclerosis and chronic diseasevery entertaining presentation but the logic for reducing cholesterol more because people with heart attacks tend to have normal readings is flawed . the fact is that cholesterol levels are just a way for drug companies to make billions selling useless statins . they have very little relation to heart disease. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2824152 / fabulous , absolutely awesome and fabulous presentation ! thank you . when the studies were done on the endotoxins that meat caused , what type of meats were used ? were they grass fed , pasture raised cattle or stock ? i think it would be interesting to see that difference … … the issue of being organic , grassfed or free range should make no difference in regards to endotoxins . even dark chocolate produced endotoxins but this was neutralized from the phytonutrients . the issue has to do with bacteria fermentation and as you know , you cannot eat meat raw due to the many colonies of bacteria living on the meat.dr. gregor , thank you for the video , unfortunately i can ever seem to get it to play the whole way through . can you repost the video or would you be willing to send it to me via email . my fiancé has suffered from depression for sometime now , and i as well . i think we both would benefit from a plant food diet , but getting her to switch may be tough . is there evidence that eating animal products can lead to depression ? if so , where ? any info would be a great help.hello – being that i am approaching my 7th survival year after surgery / radiation , a statistically important year for naso-pharyngeal chordoma people , i have wondered why the chordoma , still snuggled around my brain stem / larynx , has been practically dormant for so long . i have been a vegetarian since my teens and a vegan since 2004 , two years prior to the diagnosis in 2005 . today , i take no medications , have no pain and no further symptoms -yet . i am 61 years old too . i ’ m no tri-athelete either . is my situation improved because of my vegan , generally whole foods , diet ? i doubt many others afflicted have been long time vegans or even vegetarians . thanks for making this connection between brain / bone cancers and diet.dr. greger is a physician , nutritionist , teacher , and stand-up comedian all rolled into one . i have watched this video over and over and never get tired of it.what about salmon ? meat is not the problem , but the refined sugar the western world are consuming in large quantities . sucker excrete etc. zink , which is very important for our health. http : / / www.sciencedaily.com / releases / 2012 / 10 / 121001141003.htmfor some reason , the video would not open , but , i listened and you are amazing dr. greger ! so helpful and so interesting . thank you ! pamthis is how to do a presentation ! real information from an expert , assisted by a quality presentation format , in a readily digestible forms , with an appropriate level of factual detail . just fantastic on so many levels.re cholesterol- could it be that the research is skewed . if our intake of cholesterol is too low , the body will make enough to make up the shortfall ! no wonder cutting cholesterol intake / taking medications has done nothing to reduce the incidence of heart disease.i would like the part involving the graphic at 17 : 08 in a shorter video to post : ) is it available somewhere ? most people i know ( 23 yr old male ) wont sit down and watch almost an hr video : ( hi ryan , this hour long video was a special treat that dr. greger made available to all of us visiting this site ( see his note above ) . i did a quick search using the search tool on this site using the terms “ cancer and exercise ” and was able to locate what you are looking for right here : is it the diet , the exercise , or both ? . the entire video is 3 : 44 minutes long , and the specific part you are interested in starts at 3 : 13 . as you will see , if you do the search yourself , there are a lot of mini videos on the topic to explore ( and share ) there.thank you dr. greger for your humor and information . you are a bright light in the medical industry.bravo ! this is a much watch video for anyone who has children , or parents , or siblings , or friends , or those who eat on a daily basis … . ; ) i will share … please let me know what else i can do to spread the word ! please , translate it to russian ! if anyone knows russian and would be able to help translate it , please email me at volunteer @ nutritionfacts.org ! dr. greger , i know you are aware of what the good folks at vegsource are saying about nuts . according to various articles and a video on that site nuts do cause excessive weight gain and do not protect from diabetes , enhance endothelial function , etc . i love nuts and have been recommending them to loved ones for their purported health benefits but now i am feeling very unsure about their benefits . i just bought 20lbs of almonds to eat and give as gifts so i do have a dog in the ring so to speak . i trust your judgement and i would very much appreciate it if you could address this subject again in light of what is apparently a big controversy in the plant-based community . thanks , ben grunewaldhello @ 0417ef2be48c8cf1c97b8dec33afb372 : disqus , i hope you do not mind my chiming in here . i read your comment and thought i could share a response since i do believe that dr. greger has already addressed this issue in his nut videos ( search for “ nuts ” on this site or use the health topics index also on this site ) as well as in the original jeff nelson nut article ( in the comment section of the article ) .please also read gr . greger ’ s introductory comment to the nuts and obesity : the weight of evidence video , where he states : “ the evidence is stronger than ever that the consumption of nuts does not lead to the weight gain one would expect . ” sounds to me like you ’ ll be okay with that 20lb bag o ’ nuts . ; - ) i saw all of dr. greger ’ s nut related videos before i happened on vegsource . it is precisely the material in dr. greger ’ s videos that is called into question from what i understood . the conflict seem s to be in interpretation of some of the data . also , it sounds as if the nut-skeptics have some newer studies that seem to refute the benefits described in dr. greger ’ s work . dr. greger has replied to one of the written articles and now there is a new video and i just would like to know why there is such seeming disagreement.benjamin grunewald , mea culpa.after reading in dr. greger ’ s introductory note that he went back and actually revised and up-dated his nut video ( extending it by 8 minutes “ to cover all of the studies published in the 5 years since ” ) on august 25 , 2012 , in light of jeff nelson calling attention to dr. greger ’ s “ mischaracterization of the 2007 natoli & mccoy review ” , i thought the nut matter was resolved.goodness , does this debate have no end ? now , i too am curious to know where this matter stands at the moment . i will enjoy my handful of nuts until i hear more . ; - ) just watched the revised and extended nut video . good enough for me . i don ’ t think there is any way to refute all the evidence dr. greger presented there though the vegsource people are certainly trying . i will continue to eat and recommend nuts as part of a whole food plant based diet . thanks dr. greger and wholefoodchomper.my sentiments exactly , dr. greger ’ s nut explanation is good enough for me , too . : ) the weight is in the dose . dr. greger doesn ’ t recommend pigging out on nuts . seems to me i ’ ve even heard dr. mcdougall say to really limit nuts when reducing weight but if at healthy weight one could consume more.doesn ’ t this all boil down to … ” too much of a good thing , is not a good thing ” … sometimes simple logic and common sense suffices , … in most if not all matters , even and especially when it comes to food ? dr. greger , please make a video that examines coconut sugar as a sweetener . i and several other viewers have requested this in the comments for your healthiest sweetener video . i am posting this request here in hopes that it might be noticed . perhaps you could just add a short section onto your sweetener video . it appears that coconut sugar may be among the healthiest sweeteners if not the healthiest . my info however comes from the makers of the sugar so i am hoping you can get the “ straight dope ” on this rising star of sweeteners . i have been eating it in moderation and recommending it to others so i hope it stands up to your scrutiny . thanksmy spouse and i recently switched to a veggie diet that borders on vegan ( very difficult to eat totally vegan ) . we have always been big meat eaters and as a result i have had high cholesterol and high blood pressure ( like needing meds high for both of them ) . i ’ ve discussed these with my doctor and tried to get him to help me with diet issues but he has told me every time that “ cholesterol and blood pressure cannot be controlled through diet alone , medications are required ” . well i guess i am kind of stubborn because i started to do some research and what i have found is astonishing , amazing , unbelievable and as i have found from my personal experience , quite true ! we have both noticed a few very simple things . 1 ) . we always thought we would miss the meat because of the flavor but that is so not true ! the flavor of the food does not come from the meat , it comes from the preparation of the food . marinades and spices are used in all foods to give that zesty flavor we all crave and savor . 2 ) . i always thought i would be weak and sickly if i didn ’ t eat meat . not so at all , my energy level and stamina has increased and so has my strength with no change in my daily routine . i have gotten sick every year in the fall , for nearly 20 years , and it ’ s always taken over 2 weeks to get over it . this year all i got were the sniffles and a slightly sore throat for 3 days . 3 ) . my mental acuity has gone through the roof ! ! ! i used to have to write everything down or put it in my day planner , calendar , smart phone to remind me , or something like that . now without even trying i am remembering appointments , peoples names , and i even remember to check my calendar regularly to see if i did forget anything and i haven ’ t . 4 ) . i dropped 15 lbs. and in no time and my spouse lost close to 20 and we are still taking it off . 5 ) . probably the most important of the great things about this is that within 6 weeks my blood pressure dropped into the normal range for the 1st time in over 10 years . note there was no scientific study done here , just me living my life in a totally non meat eating way . note also that the only change was eliminating meat and almost all dairy . say what you will about the need to eat meat because i ’ ve read it or heard it all ! veggie is the way to go for us and i don ’ t think it will ever change . check out this video if you haven ’ t already “ forks over knives ” it ’ s a very well made documentary.steev cal : thank you so much for sharing your story . very inspirational . @ d9a8c65ee5b665adb0cbd70655e7fab7 : disqus , about a year ago , my significant other and i started eating primarily pbd ( no meat , dairy , just pbd at home w / more flexibility when we go out or travel ) . compared to how we used to eat ( an animal-based product at just about every meal ) we made huge and dramatic changes to the way we eat ( i mean , huge ) . admittedly , i am more hard core about our pbd eating than he is , but still he has made some major changes to his eating style.you ’ d think with all the major changes we made to our eating that we ’ d see some of the same fantastic outcomes that you and others have described experiencing when converting to pbd eating . alas , neither of us has lost any weight , my blood pressure is still on the elevated side , and his doc still has him taking statins and hypertension meds ( he recently got some labs back and his cholesterol numbers were not that good ) .i ’ ll be honest , all this has been a bit demoralizing and perplexing . although , at times i struggle convincing him “ why we are eating this way ” , still we persist knowing that the overall benefits of the pbd are worth it . i just wish that we ’ d see some improvement in outward health markers ( cholesterol , blood pressure , body weight ) . i will say , though , that i feel better ( more alert , energetic , better gi functioning , better sleeping , etc . ) on a pbd.has anyone else had similar experiences after converting to a pbd ? i have been vegan for about 6 years . i am still not slender , but that was never in my constitution . my cholesterol is still high but that may be due to genetic factors and a disability where i can ’ t exercise like i used to . that being said , i am vegan for life … my primary motivation is for the animals . “ no animal harmed ” is a beautiful thing to me . taking the blinders off and not being complicit in murder gives meaning to my life.perhaps you and your so can see it that way too : ) ? ifyoucareenough : thank you for sharing your experience and your words of wisdom with me . it helps to be reminded of the many other reasons to eat a pbd.eating a pbd is more than a diet issue for me , as well . it is about being a good steward of our environment , respecting and caring for all of our animals and the people who work in the food industry . and , you bring up a very good point regarding genetic predisposition to certain health conditions , as well.oh , i will mention that a terrible , embarrassing gagging cough condition diagnosed erroneously as lpr ( laryngopharangeal reflux ) that i had for decades bit the dust soon after nixing the dairy . that ’ s huge to me . will the doctors listen and urge their patients to go dairy-free ? very few.don ’ t give up on being vegan . the animals need you , and there ’ s more at stake than just the animals.can you please make a transcription of this video ? i would like to translate it into russian.transcript coming up ! if you ’ d like to add russian captions that would be great ! instructions here : https : / / docs.google.com / document / edit ? id = 1vlqvcunrc47yrti861qch09yesamy5e-pjgzbqaybr4great video with great information , thank you ! i love data ! i would still like to see the data on the all the potential variations of portlandia diets below . i would love to see the data on the first 2 weeks , 1 month , 3 months , 6 months , 1 year , 2 years , 5 years , 10 years , 20 , 30 etc.like this … non organic , factory farmed non organic , non factory farmed meat with no hormones or antibiotics organic , non factory farmed meat with no hormones or antibiotics organic , non factory farmed meat with no hormones or antibiotics with reduced meat organic , non factory farmed meat with no hormones or antibiotics one meat dish a day organic plant based diet organic vegan dietbut include these potential variables … bpa freeminimize all food in plastic , no tupperware , no drinks in plastic containers , no food stored in plastic , this includes produce at the grocery store , no food microwaved in plastic . organic diet , non factory farmed meat with no hormones or antibiotics , minimal plastics & wild caught fishno food microwaved ever , hardly ever , a several a week , several a day.no food processed with preservatives ever , hardly ever , a several a week , several a day.no bleached sugar ever , hardly ever , a several a week , several a day.no bleach ever , hardly ever , a several a week , several a day.no artificial sweeteners ever , hardly ever , a several a week , several a day.people who take vitamins on a regular basis … a couple times a day , once a day , a couple times a week , only when not feeling well.far too often we are told about the horrific ways that we farm meat . we are told that the answer is to stop eating meat instead of farming healthy meat . as if it is impossible to meet the meat demands for a growing global population . i have found many sustainable solutions . i also believe in the native american perspective of thanking the animal & giving respect to the animals during & after their life.this is one of the best ways that i have found to eat healthy meat in a sustainable fashion . now since the fish farm increases the local bird population , what if we ate some of those sustainable birds ? wild ducks , geese , osprey and turkey are native to this area we could reintroduce into the fish farms ecosystem . we only eat that which is sustainable . we do not create too much to be a burden on the environment . nor do we do anything that would damage the healthy sustainable symbiotic relationship with the ecosystem.here is an example of sustainable fish farm that creates a clean ecosystem … http : / / www.ted.com / talks / dan _ barber _ how _ i _ fell _ in _ love _ with _ a _ fish.htmlsustainable & humane foie gras ! every time this man runs into a problem he solves it how it should be solved , with nature . we need to find the harmony of ( wo ) man & nature working together. http : / / www.ted.com / talks / dan _ barber _ s _ surprising _ foie _ gras _ parable.htmlbe helpful , not hurtful “ i also believe in the native american perspective of thanking the animal & giving respect to the animals during & after their life . ” how noble and generous of you . don ’ t you think this is a just a little bit bit of a self-serving rationalization ? what good does this do the animal ? the animal wants to live its life unharassed and free just like you and i. i doubt they would thank you for your thank you . it ’ s 2013 already and it ’ s time to stop the archaic , maladaptive thinking . dire circumstances of survival is the only caveat that would make taking an animal ’ s life not murder . “ as if it is impossible to meet the meat demands for a growing global population ” ha , i think you give humans too much credit . we ’ ve shown very little social responsibility so far … unregulated in our popping out of babies … and tragic in the way we care for those babies … we ’ re more stupid than smart . ok well if you want to stick your head in the sand and that makes you feel better , go ahead.then at the end you say “ be helpful , not hurtful ” . really ? helpful to me , and people who have these issues through with both their hearts and their minds , is that being helpful means no animal harmed . it ’ s really a beautiful thing both personally , and collectively … i highly recommend it.the human behavior of breeding animals is , in itself , a disgusting and dark thing . please read “ eternal treblinka : our treatment of animals and the holocaust ” , by charles patterson.i ’ m no scientist , neither am i suggesting that my opinion is any more than just that . all i can say is i feel it ’ s naive to suggest that meat is a major cause of weight-gain . i think there are a thousand more obvious issues at hand and that changing to a vegan diet simply corrects health issues as a result of improving the overall nutritional profile of what people are eating.i also think it ’ s too simple to suggest we all become vegan . i truly believe there is room on all of our plates for raw plant foods and we can certainly benefit from adding more , but to entirely eliminate meat is just not realistic or healthy.human beings have lost the plot when it comes to food and food production . over-consumption of processed foods is the real issue , lets get back to basics and have healthy food cooking classes in school that teach children how to make real food.i wish some consciousness-raising would go toward looking at animals from a non-anthroprocentric mindset . are animals really “ meat : ” ? i say no , they are beings in their own right . not put here for human ’ s objectification as “ meat ” and use.i wish “ meat ” would disappear from our vocabulary.if aliens came to earth and saw you as “ meat ” , would that then make you meat ? ” well said , … kudo ! sharing with everyone , including my physicians . thank you for making this available ! thank you so much for this video . watched and shared ! absolutely fabulous ! told with great humor and clarity – this is a valuable message . the comparisons are vivid enough for me to re-think my vegetarian diet and escalate to true vegan diet.i learned immediately that animal products induce pain within four hours after consumption . there is nothing like a painful spinal injury to get me off meat , dairy , and wheat and reduce nut consumption.you are amazing and much appreciated . thanks for you enlightened presentation in el paso last night . literally changed me.thank you for your kind feedback . i ’ m always conflicted as to how much speaking i should do , and whether i would reach more people just staying put and devoting more time to my online work . it ’ s certainly nice to be able to be able to answer questions in person and get real-time feedback.please … keep keeping on , don ’ t change for anything or anyone , you are a god / dess sent ! ! i ’ ve eaten a purely plant-based diet for seven years and believe it ’ s one of the best decisions of my life ( after marrying my wife ) . i loved this video , and just saw you speak at ‘ new year , new you ’ in marshall , tx , which was a great experience.i wonder if you wouldn ’ t address a somewhat depressing hypothetical question that occurred to me as i enjoyed your presentation on the 15 leading causes of death.what would the 15 leading causes of death likely be in the u.s. if nothing was changed other than everyone following your dietary guidelines perfectly from cradle to grave ? 1 . banana peels ? i looked to china , but doubt that ’ s as relevant and helpful as their diet is increasingly westernized.such vital information ! every student doctor , nurse , naturopath , dietician , nutritionist , etc should have to watch this ! thankyou so much for your amazing workthis is a shame and a disgrace . ephesians 4 : 14 . following people who proliferate their “ beliefs ” for money . this guy is the perfect example of every wind of doctrine . he is in it for the money , and he knows you vegans utilize only part of your brain . buy this crap , and make him rich.superb , eye opening presentation . thanks for sharing and giving us all an informed choice.can this video be purchased on dvd ? i want to get copies for my kids.karna : yes ! the dvd is $ 10 . between this video and may i recommend also , forks over knives , your kids will get a great education . you can find both videos on amazon ( which you get free shipping if your total order is over $ 25 ) . i haven ’ t checked lately , but you used to be able to get the uprooting … video from dr. greger ’ s site.sure ! my website or amazon . all proceeds to charity.hello , i am squeezing in my message in here because the comments are really long . i wanted to say that your work is hands down the best i have seen . your so clear on how you articulate your thoughts and its refreshing to hear so much evidence to back up the vegan life style . i was wondering if you do your own research studies . i am still amazed on how vegan blood kills cancer cells . any possibility that future studies on transfusing vegan blood into patients with cancer . it would be nice to see the outcome . i have been vegan for almost 2 years and feel great ! thanks again dr for passing on the wonderful newsi am vegan activist for 5 years now , and for life , because my # 1 motivation is for the animals . when i started out i was very militant , but now 5 years later after hearing the myriad of reasons against veganism , i have to take pause and accept that for some people animal protein is necessary for them to feel well . how does one argue with the experience of people who say they tried to go vegan but didn ’ t feel well ? there is so much being said about “ nutritional type ” . is it possible that some people genuinely cannot do well on a vegan diet ? is there any consensus of what evolutionary biologists say ? i am so confused . dr. greger ( or anyone else ) , could you please address why veganism is so controversial from a medical standpoint ? ifyoucareenough : i ’ m not an evolutionary biologist , but i have some thoughts for you.first : dr. greger has a video on a rare genetic disorder where a boy ’ s body was not able to make one of the non-essential amino acids . humans can get all of the essential amino acids that we need from a vegan diet – but that is assuming that a person ’ s body can make all of the other amino acids . if not , then the person either does have to eat meat or take a pill . it is possible that you have talked to some people who have this ( rare ! ) genetic disorder . but it is my guess that most of the time , one of the following had been more likely going on : second : when someone says that they tried vegan and didn ’ t do well on it , i have to wonder what their diet was like . you can eat chips and white pasta and white bread and processed foods and oil drenched sauces and call yourself a vegan . that is not healthy eating , however , and no wonder they felt bad . no one is saying that eating “ vegan ” by itself is good . healthy eating is about whole plant foods with b12 and d supplements.third : even someone eating healthy foods might be missing out on a key ingredient like supplementing b12 . once again , it is a case of the human doing vegan wrong , not a case of something being wrong with whole-plant foods based eating.fourth : some people have higher needs for certain nutrients at certain times of their lives compared to other times . if they are not paying attention to their special needs , then there could be problems . for example , menstruating women typically need more iron compare to other humans . they can get the needed iron from whole plant foods , paying special attention to getting some vitamin c ( if i remember correctly ) with the plant iron to increase absorption – or they can just give up and say that the vegan diet didn ’ t work for them . with the incredible lack of education out there , how are people suppose to know what they are doing wrong ? their doctor is unlikely to be able to tell them … .fifth : i don ’ t think people should discount the power of suggestion and self-fulfilling prophesies . if you get in with a crowd who constantly tells you that you need meat and dairy , you might subconsciously start to believe it . and such a belief could lead to feeling bad without those foods . i don ’ t have any science to back this up . i just personally suspect it is a factor in some cases of people giving up on vegan eating.to address the question of : “ is there any consensus … ” there is not a consensus among people , but i think there is a concensus in the actual science . once you start doing the research , watching videos such as this one , watching the other videos on this website , reading books like the china study , etc , etc . – it becomes pretty clear that the big picture on the healthiest diet for humans is a whole-plant food based diet , supplemented with b12 and d. we may tweak our understanding of healthy foods as time goes by , but the general big picture seems unchanged for decades.hope you found these thoughts helpful.i have one more thought for you concerning : “ could you please address why veganism is so controversial from a medical standpoint ? ” i don ’ t think it is controversial from an actual medical perspective . however , there are medical professionals , most who are not educated in nutritional science ( check out dr. greger ’ s videos on the amount of nutritional education our doctors get ) , who do not support a vegan diet . why ? here ’ s my answer ( and it is one that i have read in several other places ) : going back hundreds ( thousand ? ) of years , eating meat has been strongly associated with economic success and higher social status / class . it is deeply , deeply engrained in many societies . doctors are people too and come from our society . it is just as hard for medical professionals as it is for the non-medical to even imagine that eating meat is not good for us . again , i highly recommend reading the china study which does a good job of addressing this kind of bias and showing that the controversy does not have much to do with the science . also , check out dr. greger ’ s video on the tomato effect.again , i hope you found this helpful.thank you thea , your comments reinforce my take on the thing too . but with all the weston a. price type detractors who also talk a good game and have billions of followers , i am just expressing my intense frustration that it seems like a sisyphean effort to change the paradigm.i made the mistake of going on a dr. mercola message board recently , and it was quite an unpleasant education to witness the extent of the emotional deadening , ignorance and resistance out there . makes ya want to stop the world and get off . just feelin ’ depressed . i ’ ll be okay.i understand the need for some moral support ! i just had a conversation with a person who happens to be a social worker . i was explaining the ways in which dairy is bad for you . he couldn ’ t wrap his head around it and insisted it is good for you . i said as nicely and calmly and non-judgmental as you can imagine / an honest question : “ is it possible that you are not aware of all of the science ? … ” he did think about it for a second . then he strongly shook his head , “ no ” .there is nothing you can do with people like that . he didn ’ t want to discuss it after that . we do have a long ways to go . at times like these , i find it helpful to spend some time dwelling on how far we have come . think about how much more awareness there is about animal cruelty , health , etc than there used to be . thanks for your hard work in this area . people like me appreciate it.there ’ s so much “ dealing with the devil ” that has to be done — like this appalling thing : http : / / www.meetup.com / for-the-good-of-the-animals / events / 99732962 / where donations to dog & cat shelters are largely made by carnists and the assumption is that if they don ’ t serve meat they won ’ t get the attendance / donations . i think they should challenge those assumptions ( and i intend to write some letters ) because i can ’ t , or don ’ t want to believe that people give money on the condition of what the food is going to be.anyway , i know i ’ m digressing . thanks thea for your kind reply , and i appreciate you too : ) ! amazing thank you so much dr.if vegans are not dying from these causes of death , what are they dying from ? what are the leading causes of death for vegans ? i switched to vegan after your video & the movie , “ forks over knives . ” thanks.i wish their were more educators like you sharing this type of information . thank you again for all that you do.beautiful ! i cried at the end because people like you are the reason i still have hope in humanity . i will do everything i can to make sure to tell as many people as possible about you and your wonderful site . i cannot thank you enough for your work dr. gregger ! dr gregor , i ’ m interested in recent research into salvestrols and wondered if you had come across any papers which they have been discussed , tested or reviewed ? kind regards , jim.the message is too important ; this must be shared.the information in this video , combined with the beauty of how you give the message is amazing ! i cried at the end because i am so happy that there are people like you working so hard to make the world a better place . thank you for being you dr. g.in your video you are in favour of eating nuts because they have good health benefits . dr ’ s essestyne and ornish prohibit them in their diets for treating heart disease . why the different opinions ? also see dr. harriet hall ’ s critique of this video at science-based medicine : death as a foodborne illness curable by veganismharriet hall ’ s critique is so flawed , it ’ s stunning . don matesz examines it here : http : / / donmatesz.blogspot.ca / 2013 / 02 / harriet-halls-critique-of-gregers.htmlawesome vetstud2 ! i ( a mere lay person ) was going to say something about the obvious flaws of hall ’ s arguments , but i could never have done as good a job as the page you found . thanks.does dr. gregor have a response to dr. hall ? pythagoreancrank : i had seen dr. hall ’ s critique some time ago . i find that too many of her arguments don ’ t make sense from a scientific perspective . but rather than write up a long critique myself , someone named don matesz already did it and quite well . if you are interested , you can see some of the flaws of harriet ’ s post here : http : / / donmatesz.blogspot.com / 2013 / 02 / harriet-halls-critique-of-gregers.htmlunfortunately don – a acupuncture proponent ( pseudoscience ) – didn ’ t check hall ’ s references properly ( although hall could do a better job of not spewing her agenda at the start of the article and have better referencing ) .1 . greger is citing esselstyn ’ s research in the end of this video which don missed which has not been replicated by any other researcher and had flawed methodology to begin with . even ornish research was flawed and hasn ’ t been replicated either . 2 . the nurses ’ health study statistic was cherry picked and meta analysis ’ show no effect of dietary cholesterol on heart disease , especially not comparable to smoking . however saturated fat is a risk factor which hall should have acknowledged and which greger should have used instead.there are numerous other points but the thing is that both greger and hall are agenda driven and not reliable sources here . greger is exaggerating a lot and cherry picking . hall is trying to dismiss the entire idea of a healthy plant based diet and has numerous ad hominem fallacies in her article.i nominate you as the best joker of medicine . in your next presentation you may put red nose and catch the younger generation … they need more of what you are saying.why aren ’ t you on the presidents council ? or maybe flotus council ( even though she loves the camera ) or bloomberg stopping 32oz drinks ! does anyone think these things work ? answer no , only your video tells the truth . thanks so muchplease give more info on type 1 diabetes and a whole plant food diet . some diabetics view starches as the enemy . i would like more evidence or tips that would convince friends to shift their western diet to a healthier one.i second that . although it still doesn ’ t mean that doctors will change what they are telling their patients . and doctors are still “ god ” to patients . my boyfriend , who is a committed ethical vegan , has a son who is a type 1 diabetic . his son is very accessible to becoming an ethical vegan because of what he has learned from his dad , but his doctor told him that he needs animal protein in his diet . so he eats alot of fish , and some chicken.i don ’ t have the nerve to say a word of interference in his son ’ s diet . would anyone here be able to ? it ’ s too delicate.pam : if you have not already read it , you might want to check out the book : “ dr. neal barnard ’ s program for reversing diabetes ” . he addresses type 1 in the book . it may not be as much information as you would like , but i don ’ t think that we have all the answers for type 1 yet either . i think this book will help answer your questions though . i thought the book was awesome.thank you so very much.i just want to know how a person , on a very limited budget , can eat vegetarian or vegan ? i am 51 , female , obese , unemployed.i eat very little beef or pork , i eat ground turkey , chicken legs and thighs , tuna and , if they are on sale , fish like salmon , perch , whiting , cat fish or talapia.i only get corn , carrots , peas and , when on sale , tomatoes , lettuce and bell peppers.i eat fruit but can ’ t always afford them . bananas , tangerines , clementines , apples , oranges , pears.i also eat a lot of pastas ! they are inexpensive ! i love healthy foods but don ’ t have the finances for them ! but , i have noticed a huge change in my health in the past 4 years ! bp is a little higher than normal , i ’ m having pain on right side of chest and in my back , may be caused by gall bladder , have noticed a lot of stiffness in hands and body , i have tendonitis in both hands , had cts in both hands , numbness and tingling in my lips , feet get cold and can ’ t get warm , i have allergies to dust , mold and pollen , i ’ m sick every year at the same time , from september to april and sometimes even break out with cold sores , i am always coughing and sneezing and have to keep a box of kleenex close , i also have a very bad allergy to any nickle product . i touch anything with nickle in it and get these hives or patches on my skin where it came in contact with the item ! they itch and look more like ring worm but are not . i ’ ve had some of my problems since childhood , but most have started in the past 4 years ! maybe even longer than that ! i had just lost 51lbs over a 5 month period , but then the severe back pain started and left me close to immobile for days at a time ! it was in the lower lumbar area ! how can a person , like me , on a very tight budget , say , like about $ 50 a week for 2 adults , on a good payday , eat a very healthy , vegetarian diet to get healthy and lose excess weight ? ? i have no idea how severe my health is because we have no health insurance and can ’ t afford to go to a doctor or the hospital ! ! i have also been depressed lately , but i just though it was from losing my 2 cats in the past year and not being able to find a job . but , from what you ’ ve said in your speech , it could be my diet causing all my health issues ? ? i need help but don ’ t know where to turn.i want to get healthy so that i can find work ! i also need work so that i can get healthy ! a “ catch 22 situation ” ! any ideas will help ! thank you , brenda w.good for you for wanting to make some positive changes in your eating habits and lifestyle ! trying to eating plant-based and whole foods on a limited budget is most definitely a real economic challenge for many many people in the u.s. i have a few suggestions that may be helpful to you.first , watch as many videos as you can on this site . there are many suggestions on how to integrate healthy food into your diet . dr. greger even has “ cost savings ” indexed in the “ health topics ” side bar . look under that category to get info on how to get the most for your buck.second , the environmental working group ( ewg ) has put a helpful resource guide called good food on a tight budget . i think you might some very helpful tips in there.third , seek out the available food banks in your community , and get groceries that are as unprocessed as possible . you may also want to see if there is a discount grocery store in your area where you can purchase either frozen fruits and veggie or canned fruits , veggies , and beans ( without salt , sugar ) .fourth , see if there are any other resources in your community that can assist you economically ( e.g. , food stamps , food support , financial support , etc . ) fifth , seek out as much information on the plant-based eating as you can either on the internet or at books borrowed from the library . the more you read and learn , the more you will be able to figure out ways to eat as healthfully as possible on a tight budget ; it will also keep you inspired to maintain the changes you are making .

brenda , wishing you all the best of luck . please keep us updated on your progress.sorry to read about your situation . thea had some excellent suggestions . in my experience eating a plant based diet is alot less expensive then the standard american diet . pasta is an excellent choice but so are potatos and rice . rice can often be purchased in bulk . the cost of meat , dairy and eggs are high even with the government subsidies . you need to come up a basic menu that works for your family … 1-2 for breakfast , 3-4 for lunch , and 6-8 for dinner works for most folks . if you have access to the internet through public library or friend you can get excellent recipes and information about health from dr. john mcdougall ’ s website . you might start by viewing his free lecture on the starch solution … look under free lectures and check out the many free recipes courtesy of his wife , mary , as well . if you have some space you might consider planting some herbs or vegetables to help offset the cost of food . farmers markets can be helpful if you have access as foods that are seasonal as they tend to be cheaper . i would build the diet around starches with a variety of vegetables and occasional fruits and beans . the only supplement you will need if you eat a well designed plant based diet is vitamin b12 which is inexpensive as a tablet or can be obtained by eating foods such as soy or almond milk which are often enriched . you should view the series of videos by dr. greger in february 2012 . unfortunately many of us have conditions courtesy of years of poor eating which we are stuck with but the body given the right nutrition can stablilize , reverse and often cure many of these conditions . i have been impressed by the progress of my patients who eat healthy . good luck.how vegan is vegan ? dr. greger : i have taken your “ leading causes of death ” video to heart , and am trying to follow a vegan diet ; but i wonder how strictly it has to be followed in order to have the benefits you describe . i eat strictly vegan at home , but when i go to a potluck meal , is it ok if the salad has some shreds of cheese sprinkled on it , or if the strawberries are dipped in milk chocolate rather than dark chocolate ? does it make a significant difference if the vegetable oil french fries are fried in have also had fish fried in it ? if the fifth item on the “ contains less than two percent … ” list on a label is “ sweet dairy whey ” ? how much animal-product contamination negates the nutritional benefit of a plant-based diet ? thanks ! kennita : congratulations on making such a significant change in your diet.i ’ m not dr. greger , but maybe these thoughts will be helpful to you . > > how strict do you have to be ? i don ’ t think anyone knows the answer to that . even if such an answer existed , i think it would be a huge , “ it depends ” based on a variety of factors . there wouldn ’ t be a clear , “ three bites a week is fine , after that , you are hosed ” . so much depends on your genetics , environment , and what you are really eating.i think we can say that the occasional cheat is probably fine health-wise . but how much is occasional ? once a year ? once a week ? ? ? ? what i have picked up from dr. greger ’ s videos and other materials i have read is that our health on animal foods is a sliding scale . it also seems that it doesn ’ t take that much animal food to push people into real risk levels . thus , it falls on you to decide how much risk you want to take . one bite of milk chocolate a month . probably fine . after that , you are on your own . ; - ) ( of course , i just made that up to make a point . ) if it was me , i would not make as many exceptions as you do , because it all adds up . on the other hand , you do not want to start to feel deprived , because then you might give up completely . so , i recommend thinking about what is really important to you . is that bite of milk chocolate vital , but the potlucks could be something you take a stand on ? or vica versa ? so , start down a healthier path by just making those exceptions which are super important to you , but making fewer other exceptions . try to go down a path that takes you in a healthy direction rather than going cold turkey or doing nothing . that ’ s just my opinion.another thought i have for you is to find other motivations . i know lots of people who are only semi-motivated by health arguments . even people who wholly acknowledge that a whole plant food diet with b12 supplement is by far the healthiest diet , find themselves making lots of exceptions or unable to change at all . but when they learn about the ethical and environmental arguments for a whole plant food diet , they become very motivated . those little exceptions no longer seem palatable.in that light , you might consider watching movies like : vegucated , food inc , earthlings , glass walls ( available free on youtube ) , etc . and read a book called the veganist , which one of my staunch meat-eating co-workers found motivating . it doesn ’ t take much research to find the environmental information either . consider the strong link between a plant diet and slowing global climate change . and find articles like this one ( that broke my heart ) : http : / / www.huffingtonpost.com / megan-pincus-kajitani / want-to-save-starving-sea _ b _ 2897651.htmllearn that stuff and you will find yourself * wanting * to no longer make those exceptions that also happen to hurt your health.that ’ s my 2 cents . in the mean time , celebrate your existing progress . good for you ! thanks for the input ! i do pretty well ( at the ostara potluck , i skipped the chocolate chip cookies , but had one whole grain fig newton ( which had whey somewhere low on the ingredient list ) . i think i can keep it to that level pretty easily ; absolute zero-tolerance would probably be too stressful.i ’ ll try to find some of those movies you mentioned — thanks ! live long and prosper , kennitai agree with thea , moderation is extremely difficult to maintain as a lot of a little unhealthy foods here and there can quicklyy become the bulk of the calories.when the correlations are so unbelievably surprising , it is perhaps simply because they are not to be believed … .. correlation is not causality ! guest : re : “ when the correlations are so unbelievably surprising … ” that ’ s your ignorance of the science showing . these results are not only not surprising , but quite common . time to take notice ? i think a fundamental out-of-the-box look at the use of the word “ meat ” would put everything into clarity . it is just a linguistic euphemism , and a way of distancing ourselves from the truth — the truth that “ meat ” was once a whole animal with a face , and emotions , and a desire to live unmolested just like we do.i ask , are animals really “ meat ” ? or do they exist in this world for their own reasons . if aliens came from another planet and saw us as “ meat ” would that then make us “ meat ” ? it ’ s time to take a hard look at this word that we never question … a word that objectifies and commodifies animals to the status of nothing . it ’ s one and the same with the dehumanization of women and men who are imaged as “ meat ” in our sick society . relegate to “ the other ” . feel no empathy.come on non-vegans — time to open your heart and evolve.let ’ s phase out the word “ meat ” from our vocabulary.help ! i want to share this with my sister but she is hearing impaired ! is there a transcript or video with captions available ? ? ? nick , there is a little button that says “ cc ” under the video in the tool bar . click on that to turn on closed captioning.dr. greger — you are totally the best ! this is an awesome video . i am recommending this video to everyone i know . this information should be available in spanish ! ! ! i would love to help get the word out to the latino community . let me know how i can help.luz ! ! irene from myhealthycocina — health starts in the kitchen.i absolutely agree irene ! care to translate ? instructions here : https : / / docs.google.com / document / edit ? id = 1vlqvcunrc47yrti861qch09yesamy5e-pjgzbqaybr4mr greger , may i embed russian subtitles in this video and upload on my youtube account ? i ’ ll provide all references to original video and this site – i just ask permission in order not to violate copyright.i ’ d be honored – please do ! thank you very much ! bravo ! love it ! my grandson was diagnosed with mds at the age of 17 . one of the things i asked just about everyone that i spoke with at the time , in the medical profession , was the importance of diet . everyone said the same thing , “ it ’ s not important ! ” i suppose they gave up on him right from the start . i ’ ll never know if things might have been different with a vegan diet . the mds eventually became leukemia and he died at age 20 . anyway , i really enjoyed this presentation on “ uprooting the leading causes of death ” , taped on july 12 , 2012 , and would really like to be able to see more of these informative videos . also , aside from the obvious , what would be the best way to begin a vegan diet ? is there a way to subscribe to these longer videos ? maryjs : i just sent a reply to shaheen with ideas about how to get started on eating healthy . check out those ideas.i also wanted to express condolences . that ’ s such a sad story . my thoughts are with you.concerning the videos : most of videos dr. greger posts on this site are 2-4 minutes long , though some are longer and happily so ! even though the videos are shorter than this one , they often tell a story / are part of series . i recommend finding the first video of volume 1 ( i ’ m not sure how to do that as the search didn ’ t work the last time i tried it ) , watch it , then use the the “ next video ” link on the panel on the right of the screen . you can keep doing that until you have eventually seen all the videos all . so , you will have watched literally hours and and hours worth of videos to meet that desire of yours to see longer videos . well worth your time as there is a lot more information out there than was in this one video . ( though i agree that this one video is great too . ) good luck.i really enjoyed this video and intend on showing it to my communications students as a good example of effective academic presenting ( with the hopes that they ’ ll take the content in as well ) .living in korea i ’ ve gradually reduced my meat intake as koreans traditionally treat meat as more a garnish than a basic ingredient ( becoming what i ’ d call a ‘ lessetarian ’ ) . i would like to know what the good doctor thinks about yogurt , something i still enjoy a great deal with cereals and nuts . bad but not so bad ? : > ken : good for you for going on the lessetarian path . hopefully you can go on a lessetarian path with your dairy consumption too . from all of the dairy videos i ’ ve seen on this nutritionfacts site , plus what i have read about dairy in books like the china study and building bone vitality – diary is at least as bad as meat.i think one of the dr.s in the interviews follow up dvd for forks over knives refers to dairy ( ie , yogurt , etc . ) as “ liquid meat ” . that really stuck with me.i don ’ t know if they sell such things where you are , but companies do sell plant-based yogurts . i vastly prefer the coconut ones to the soy ones , but it is a personal preference and i suspect that the soy ones are healthier . also , i there are recipes out there for making your own plant-based yogurts . ( for example , check out the book artisan vegan cheeses . ) so , if you are interested , you do have options.that ’ s awesome that you are pointing your students to this video . i agree that it is an extremely wonderful example of how to present academic materials in a way that people can take in and enjoy . good luck to you and your students.saw this talk at the vegfest in tampa a couple months ago . i ’ m glad it ’ s on video now ! ! so incredibly interesting and entertaining . thank you dr. greger for your vast curiosity and desire to educate the public ! ! i am definitely passing this on ! ! what to eat everyday ? .lots of great recipe sites on the web . i like happy herbivore if you dont know what to cook , she has a recipe plan you can buy for really cheap and you can relearn how to cook . don ’ t buy prepackaged foods . they are just as bad for you as prepackaged non vegan foods . good luck you can do it ! fatfreevegan is another great site ! toni ’ s ideas are very good . there are some great sites that give you plenty of free ideas.two other ideas for you are : 1 ) cookbooks . there are two book that i think are good for beginners : everyday happy herbivore and vegan on the cheap.2 ) do one of pcrm ’ s ( physician committee for responsible medicine ) 21 kickstart programs . they hold your hand through 21 days with meal plans , recipes , inspirational messages , etc . and it ’ s free.once you get started , you will be amazed at the variety and fulfillingness ( i know i made that up ) of the food dishes available to people who eat healthy.best of luck to you ! this is soooo good ! tweeted it ! this was a very eye opening video for me and helped play a part in my decision to become vegan.thank you for this great video ! i am posting a link to it from my whole foods recipe blog ! hi dr. greger , i have seen rumors going around about fruit from the graviola tree aka sour sop , aka soursop . the claims are that it is an effective cancer killer . have you seen any conclusive evidence one way or the other ? doc , have you ever studied h202 treatments ? love your work ! i started cutting all breads , meats out of my diet and started eating raw and cooked vegetables and four months later i have come down with ulcerative colitis. crazy right.so , now i am doing h202 treatments in hopes it will clear up the colitis ? thanks , what about the theory that cholesterol is a myth ? ? in the great cholesterol myth , bowden and sinatra show the source of heart disease is sugar and inflammation . just as many people die of heart disease who have low cholesterol as have high . total cholesterol tells you nothing about your risk for heart disease … in fact our brains need it so total cholesterol should be between 200-250 . organic eggs , olive oil , coconut oil , butter … saturated fat … all encouraged . what matters is the kind of ldls you have . so how can two such opposing theories be correct ? dr. greger , can you address this ? i touch on that in a q & a : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / how-does-the-paleo-diet-impact-cholesterol / the theory is based on misconstrued science and goes completely against what countless studies have shown for years . perhaps the appeal is that it is rebellious and against the “ system ” , but there is truly no justification whatsoever to think that carbohydrates cause heart disease . dr. greger ’ s link below will take you to his free e-book carbophobia which gathers the science on this subject.i have several questions : did any of this research account for whether plant based diets did or did not include genetically modified veggies ? did they account for whether or not meat eaten was organic , not treated with antibiotics or steroids ? did they account for consumption of refined sugars or starches among either meat eaters or vegetarians ? are there studies that evaluate igf1 levels among people who do or do not consume refined starches and sugars ? among those who do or do not consume gluten ? great presentation . glad to see it.i also wonder if any research examines use of yogurt versus fluid milk and cheese ? organic yogurt versus non ? seems like fermented versions should be our friends , as they help keep the gut flora in balance.in a prior session you mentioned oregano kills bacteria ? so if , eat is cooked with oregano , would that kill the bacteria mentioned in this presentation ? thanks for all of the good information and the good presentations . have there been any studies on the effect of not ingesting food and water for 24 hours and its effects on health ? don ’ t babies need a certain amount of animal protein for their brains to develop properly ? dr greger , did you mean that the recording was made surreptitiously ? thank you for caring enough to take your valuable time to post the information ! i know that it is not easy finding the time ! just wanted you to know it is appreciated , useful , thought provoking , and makes one question their lifestyle and positive changes for the better ! billybravo , dr. greger ! fantastic presentation ! exceptionally informative and well-conveyed message . and what a powerful message it is . keep up and great work ! ! dear dr. greger , have watched this video many times and was very interested in the link between bacteria from animal food in the gut being implicated in heart disease.however there must be another culprit too . if i am not mistaken the first autopsy to list heart disease was in 1929 . many sources have stated that it was non existent at the turn of the last century . i think we were eating a lot of animal foods back then . of course i could be wrong but if not something else must have come into our diet that is also responsible . oils and trans fat maybe ? sugar ? this has been eating at me . what do you think is the full story on heart disease . i ’ m a big fan . thanks so much . neddermy problem is , i cant do dairy ( casein and lactose issues ) , cant digest nuts , so cant envision living on lentils . now we hear bad things about soy . i do like a protein-packed meat meal ( humanely raised and hopefully quickly slaughtered ) from time to time.my father has been vegan for 20 years . he lives healthy active lifestyle . but on the last blood exam the cholesterol levels were very high … i am second guessing his and my veganism.it ’ s probably famillal hypercholesteremia . i have it . red yeast rice seems to have brought it down considerably.you ’ re not vegan for ethical reasons ? i ’ m curious why.dear dr. greger : i am a triple board certified interventional cardiologist and have been in practice for 30 years . i am absolutely thrilled with your work . i give a lot of free lectures on the benefits of vegan diet and daily exercise which i recommend to all my patients . i have started to use some of the information you have provided in my presentations . but i would like to use some of your graphs and other illustrations in my presentations . is there anyway , you will be willing to post your graphs as power point slides that i can use in my presentations ? you would be doing a great service to us medical colleagues who want to disseminate this information to the public . i will , of course , acknowledge you as the source of these graphs and will give you full credit.thanks noah n. chelliah , md , facc , facp , fccptruly something ! thank you ! question : if meat is not safe not due to protein or fat but to a bacteria , is organic , all natural , etc , whey protein safe ? thanks ! marite : if you get a chance , explore some of the other videos on this site . you will see that there are some inherent health risks with the animal products themselves regardless of how the animal is raised . good luck ! i would love to see the study ’ s that compare healthy plant and meat based diets with sad and then vegan and vegetarian . and i would love to see how all these studies were controlled as i imagine vegans and vegetarians make many many choices unrelated to nutrition that affect their health status . i don ’ t imagine all this potentially sensational meat bashing is going to make the average american or anyone else for that matter change their culture and habits – in fact it ’ s liable to make them revolt , so realistically this information is potentially quite counterproductive isn ’ t it ? “ time to get real ” : this isn ’ t meat-bashing for the sake of sensationalism . this video and the many others on this site are sharing the very real fact that the body of scientific evidence shows that the best diet for health is a whole plant food based diet supplemented with b12.anyone who wants to get healthy and is willing to learn about the science would be quite persuaded by this video . i personally know two people who have completely changed their diets based primarily on seeing this video . ( or at least this video started it . ) it is true that people who are very invested in their current habits will look for any reason to not change . ( they might say something like : “ i ’ m sure there ’ s significant flaws in those studies dr. greger shows . i ’ m so sure of it , i ’ m not even going to bother to look . ” ) in that case , this video , while not counter productive , will not change such people . but then , nothing likely is . fyi : if you really are interested in seeing the studies , each study is cited under the individual videos on the rest of this site . though you will have to hunt for the correct videos first to find the citations.that ’ s as real as it gets.quinoa is now my new best friend … this type of misinformation is indicative of why western civilization is in decline … thank you so very much for your enlightening work.dr. gerber , your video ” uprooting the leading causes of death ” helped me in the most powerful way.i love you , gaia cunninghamwas that you ? thank you for this wonderful , humorous and informative video ! ! love the dvd . as a 64 year old who converted to veganism 2 years ago , your website and dvd ’ s are terrific education to keep me on the path of better health and to help fine-tune my shopping . thanks ! ! awesome as usual ! … you leave no room 4 doubts ! and thanx a the great humor ! your info is the best tool i use to show people the truth about nutrition ! ( 16 years vegan , 3 years raw foodist , yoga teacher , ayurvedic consultant ) dear dr. michael greger , i have shown this video to my mother who was recently diagnosed with stage iv triple-negative breast cancer , and my five sisters , all of whom have dairy and meat-based diets . four of my sisters being nurses , and my mother also being a nurse , they really appreciated your professional approach to the topic of plant-based diet and i feel they were very moved by it . i wish to thank you personally as your video may have done much more for my family than you may know.from the deepest place in my heart , i thank you . -benjaminbenjamin : that ’ s so nice of you to share this story ! i ’ m keeping my fingers crossed for your whole family.just in case you were not aware , i thought i would let you know that this video you commented on is the first year-summary posted on nutritionfacts . dr. greger has recently posted the second summary , which may also interest you and your family : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases / i also highly recommend the video : forks over knives.finally , if you are looking for some assistance in implementing a plant-based diet , the free pcrm 21 day kick-start on-line program is awesome . as are several cookbooks such as : let them eat vegan , vegan on the cheap , and everyday happy herbivore.good luck to you all ! omg . i have had problems with my thyroid for years . i have not been able to loss weight . i have tried everything . diets , diet pill , jenny craig , ww . i was also diagnosed with ra . after having a bad reaction to hydrochloriqun i opened my eyes and quite eating wheat , milk . in two months my ra was gone . today after seen my endo today and telling him how i quite eating wheat , milk and some eggs how i been loosing weight and my ra is gone . he told me to watch you youtube. and how my goodness i wil be a vegan from now on . thank you for opening my eyes to health . i am in charge of my life , and your right dr ’ s need to tell you a little more about diet . ( and not the genny craig one ’ s ) . thank you again , you are my new superman.rachel : congratulations on finding the healthiest diet in the world ! it ’ s always easier to prevent a disease than reverse one and there are no guarantees . that said , you are on to a diet that will give you the best chance / lowest risk when it comes to diseases , including ra.one thing to keep in mind : a healthy diet is not just “ vegan ” , but what people call “ whole plant food based ” . you can get an idea of what that means by signing up for a free program like the 21 day kickstart or getting a good cookbook like let them eat vegan and everyday happy herbivoir.i wish you all the luck.i really find your video ’ s very good and informative but i don ’ t agree that a vegan diet stops cancer for everyone because robin gibb was a vegan , although i understand it can significantly reduce the risk.this is fantastic ! dr. greger , you are a fabulously entertaining speaker and you explain what so many have left unclear . thank you for the details and the references , and for your blithe spirit . i wish you had more longer , yes , longer videos.this video is making me go vegan.moderation is the answer ! moderation is plant based foods and moderation in animal based as well . eat a healthy mix of both , don ’ t over eat and cut the fat out as much as possible . if vegan was the answer , all vegan ’ s would live to 90 or 100 . has anyone done a “ scientific ” study of life expectancy between vegans and non-vegans ? i have vegan indian friends whose parent died in their 60 ’ s and early 70 ’ s . of heart attacks and strokes ! the culprit in america is stress caused by lack of true faith and meaning in people ’ s lives ! stress causes cancer ! right , animals are expendable nothings . they have no place in our consciousness as beings in their own right.what “ meaning ” can one possibly have in one ’ s life , if one views animals as absent referrents ? what “ true faith ” can one have if one deems , by some devine edict , that animals are less deserving of life and peace than humans ? obviously you are a misguided animal rights activist . your kind would rather humans were eliminated ( aborted ) so cows , chickens and pigs could live.dr. thank you very much for your video ! i am a 30 years and vegan for 3 years already ! but my patients don ’ t believe me . i worked in russia for 15 years , in israel 13 years . in canada live 5 years . now all send to your websitei wish pbs showed this video every month . pbs should become the broadcaster for the public , the disorganized , disenfranchised , alienated people whose work and resources supports everything.how many vagans or vegetarians do you know who lived to be past 100 yo ? all the people who lived past 100 and whose lives have been studied in details ate fish , meat and even bacon . the whole vagan thing is a big scam.no native population is 100 % vegan , but there are those that get close . the okinawans for example are very close to vegans and have the most centenarians per capita.caloric restriction , the traditionalokinawan diet , and healthy agingthe diet of the world ’ s longest-lived people and its potential impact on morbidity and life spanann . n.y. acad . sci . 1114 : 434 – 455 ( 2007 ) .table 1 . traditional dietary intake of okinawans and other japanese circa 1950total calories 1785total weight ( grams ) 1262caloric density ( calories / gram ) 1.4total protein in grams ( % total calories ) 39 ( 9 ) total carbohydrate in grams ( % total calories ) 382 ( 85 ) total fat in grams ( % total calories ) 12 ( 6 ) saturated fatty acid 3.7monounsaturated fatty acid 3.6polyunsaturated fatty acid 4.8total fiber ( grams ) 23food group weight in grams ( % total calories ) grainsrice 154 ( 12 ) wheat , barley , and other grains 38 ( 7 ) nuts , seeds less than 1 ( less than 1 ) sugars 3 ( less than 1 ) oils 3 ( 2 ) legumes ( e.g. , soy and other beans ) 71 ( 6 ) fish 15 ( 1 ) meat ( including poultry ) 3 ( less than 1 ) eggs 1 ( less than 1 ) dairy less than 1 ( less than 1 ) vegetablessweet potatoes 849 ( 69 ) other potatoes 2 ( less than1 ) other vegetables 114 ( 3 ) fruit less than 1 ( less than 1 ) seaweed 1 ( less than 1 ) pickled vegetables 0 ( 0 ) foods : flavors & alcohol 7 ( less than 1 ) data derived from analysis of u.s. national archives , archived food records , 1949 and based on survey of 2279 persons.some pointstheir diet was 85 % carb , and 6 % fat . sweet potatoes ( a japanese sweet potato ) made up almost 70 % of their calories . nuts were less than 1 % of calories ( the equivalent of 1 / 10 of an ounce a day ) oil was less than 2 % of calories ( which is about 1 tsp a day ) and sugars were less than 1 % of calories ( less than a tsp a day ) the total animal products including fish was less than 4 % of calories which is less then 70 calories a day . that is the equivalent of around 2 oz of animal products or less a daylook up the blue zone study . the vegans in loma linda , ca reach the centenarian mark with a much greater frequency than the general population.i hope dr. greger or another reader can help me with this . i have been a vegetarian for 23 years and vegan for most of it . i have a lot of arthritis , especially in an elbow that was injured over 60 years ago . my doc , an alternative consultant , put me on fish oil about eight years ago . at that time i was living a mostly vegan lifestyle in that my home life was vegan but i would sometimes eat scallops when in a restaurant . so i went along with his suggestion and began the fish oil . then about one year ago i wised up , went 100 % vegan again , which included stopping the fish oil supplements . a month later i had the most painful elbow attack , then another about three weeks later . i had to take very strong painkillers both times . my doc was alarmed that i had stopped the fish oil , but i told him it doesn ’ t fit with my ethical standards for so many reasons , not the least of which is over-fishing , pollution of the oceans , mercury levels and , of course , the suffering of the animal . he maintains that sometimes one has to do what is best for one ’ s health even if it means going against one ’ s values . i told him i was taking flax oil , but he claims that it doesn ’ t have the necessary dha / epa that i need . from what i can find out , he is right about the dha ; there doesn ’ t seem to be any in the flax oil . i want to know if there is any way i can get the vegetarian equivalent of fish oil for arthritis and inflammation . ( i am back on the fish oil , and have had no more extreme pain in the elbow . i am happy about that , but most unhappy to be violating my vegan lifestyle in this manner . ) gramma kat : what a dilemma . i ’ m no expert , but i know that dr. greger recommends that we take seaweed sourced dha ( potentially with epa ) supplements . that is a way to get the ( often unfounded ) benefits of fish oil without the contaminants and without destroying the oceans . perhaps you could give that a try ? there are others who know more about the specific supplements . perhaps they will jump in with specific help . but i think you could get just about any brand and do fine with it.hope that helps . good luck ! thank you ! it sounds like a good alternative , although i suppose seaweed becomes contaminated as well as fish . still , i feel it would be a much better choice.re : seaweed becoming contaminated … i could be completely wrong , but it is my understanding that the companies which make the seaweed ( or maybe it was algae ? ) based dha supplements grow their own stuff in fully controlled vats . so , they aren ’ t getting it from the sea . * should * be quite safe . ( of course there are no guarantees . but at least it seems like the safest option . ) yes , i was thinking the same thing . the best part is it doesn ’ t involve the killing of the animal . now i need to figure out how much of the micro-algae to take to equal the same punch as the fish oil.gramma kat : in case you will find it helpful , here is a link to dr. greger ’ s nutrition recommendations , which includes a recommended amount to take of dha : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps.the reason some fish have much higher levels of heavy metals than others is related to the process of bio-concentration . for instance a fish that eats weed will have less than a fish that eats 1000s of other fish a year which also eat 1000s of other fish a year . hence older sharks will have some of the highest levels of hg . the areas they inhabit would also be related , like bays historically subject to lots of industrial pollution you ’ d expect would have higher levels.dr. greger , thank you for being one of the people to lead this plant-based food revolution . this highlights shocking and important research that others , including our government are not giving us proper information about . my husband and i have been on a plant-based diet for a year and the difference is amazing … .we will never go back.excellent , can the good doctor discuss the benefits of green / herbal teas as an adjunct to all diets discussedi wonder how this plays out whilst intermittent fasting ? similar to how we use to eat hundreds and thousands of years ago.thanks doc , at first i thought you were a sellout when i started reading your spiel on flax seeds , but as soon as you mentioned “ preventing the problem from the start ” i knew you meant a plant-based diet . just wanted to say thank you for spreading the good word . i ’ m sick of doctors spreading misinformation and then i have to do hours of explanations a week to people who just needed some doctors “ blessing ” to continue torturing themselves with an “ improper diet ” as i like to call it . thanks again.great videos . dr greger how do you protect your work from confirmation bias and ‘ cherry picking ’ your sources ? i find it hilarious how so many people faced with real scientific research still say it ’ s not true . sad as well because of the reasons for death can be prevented but not living on the cirrent american diet.thank you for all your hard work dr. greger . i have been on a whole food plant based diet for two years now . i have dropped about 25 lbs , and i haven ’ t been sick in two years , not even a cold . my energy is through the roof . i am 46 and i have reclaimed my 25 year old body and energy ! i needed this . thank you.hi , dr. greger , i was wondering if you have commented on a recent medical publication stating that vegetarians have a lower life expectancy than those with a more omnivorous diet . sorry , i don ’ t recall the source , but it made a splash on some social pages in the last week . i ’ d prefer to hear your opinion on this . i ’ m an md trained in the 80 ’ s when there was horribly little nutritional info in our curriculum and just discovered your youtube channel . over the years i knew there was much more importance to nutritional issues and haven ’ t found anything like the scholarly work you are doing . thanks.cassian , this talk : https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = q7kerwdih04 was a few years ago … but in it dr greger addressed issues about vegan life expectancy . ( i am just another reader passing by ) a balanced diet is a balanced diet . n.a.s eat wa-a-ay too much meat and very fatty meat at that. add that the animals are “ manufactured ” and not allowed to grow in normal time without all the hormones ; drugs and shots they have to be given for just being on the “ factory farm floor ” ; add the gmo feeds with drugs in them ; add that the animals dont get any exercise cuz theyre penned in- like people in office spaces .. and if “ we the people ” dont stop monsanta-claws , the madam of food whores , well you can kiss-off the health benefits of any diet.thank you – a friend referred me to your site since i have breast cancer stage 4 . used to eat only plant based foods from 1970 ’ s to 1990s . now i am changing back.dr. fuller – i ’ m so sorry to hear about the cancer . this is a great site for learning about foods shown to have an impact on cancer in general , and breast cancer in particular . you have probably already found some of those pages , but just in case , here is a recent article that links to a bunch of other videos on this site : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 03 / 20 / breast-cancer-and-wine / the mushroom studies particularly interest me.good luck to you . i ’ ll keep you in my thoughts.thank you for your hard work . i am so glad that there are doctors like you out there giving us the information that we need to make good decisions on are health . i am learning so much and sharing it with ever one i can all though most think i am nuts . i am glad if one person listen and does there research and then starts to eat better i am happy . so again thank youcan we be % 80 vegan . ? will it get us close to vegan risk levels by % 80 . ? i love the idea of it but realisticly it is a life changing challenge . i am so much worried about food but egg specialy as an ingredient ( it is everywhere ) , milk , cheese , yogurt.if you have to put a name to it- sounds like you are more “ vegetarian ” not “ vegan ” . it is a learning process for sure but very doable and can be done using baby steps if that suits you best . have you looked at the research on dairy and health ? http : / / nutritionfacts.org / index.php ? s = dairyon a scale of 1-10 , where 1 is not at all motivated to change your diet and 10 is 100 % motivated , what number would you give yourself at the moment ? plant based diet sounds great , what about all the cancer causing pesticides used on the vegetables ? ? ? mike : dr. greger has a great blog post where he puts pesticide consumption into perspective . : “ a new study calculated that if half the u.s. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables , 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented . at the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases . so by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk , but that ’ s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption . even if all we had to eat was the most ontaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks . ” from : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 06 / 25 / apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes / i translate this bit of info into : eat organic when you can , but don ’ t stress about it when you can ’ t.happily , there is a way to take this advice a step further to minimize your risks without completely depleting the pocketbook . every year , the environmental working group actually measures pesticide levels in fruits and veggies – after those fruits and veggies have been prepared in the way people would normally eat them . ( for example , peeling a banana or washing first . ) if you scroll down on the following page , you will see a list for the “ dirty dozen ” and the “ clean fifteen ” . http : / / www.ewg.org / foodnews / summary.phphope that helps.the fd allows tomatoes to be sprayed with as many as 5 different pesticides as long as they don ’ t go over the amount specified by the fd for each of the 5 pesticides . the government is killing us.yes and no combination trials have ever , in the history of pesticides , be required.one study that plotted population cancer incidence against pesticide usage in prevalent crops found that cotton growing areas positively associated with the highest cancer areas in the usa . they spray cotton with up to ten different pesticides and herbicides in high concentrations . “ a new study calculated that if half the u.s. population ate just one more serving of conventional fruits and vegetables , 20,000 cases of cancer could be prevented . at the same time the added pesticide consumption could cause up to 10 extra cancer cases . so by eating conventional produce we may get a tiny bump in cancer risk , but that ’ s more than compensated by the dramatic drop in risk that accompanies whole food plant consumption . even if all we had to eat was the most contaminated produce the benefits would far outweigh any risks . ” http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2013 / 06 / 25 / apple-peels-turn-on-anticancer-genes / have you responded to this criticism ? http : / / www.sciencebasedmedicine.org / death-as-a-foodborne-illness-curable-by-veganism / i would be interested in hearing a response to this as well . i did notice quite a few biases and some misreferencing . however dr. greger does of course have biases as well and has arguably cherry picked evidence for this video.with protein being such a crucial macronutrient and the powerhouse of our bodies structure and metabolism , how does one get proper amounts with a plant based diet ? claudia : you question is quite understandable given the information about protein that we are inundated with in the media . the happy news is that it is incredibly easy to get enough protein on a plant based diet by eating a well-rounded whole plant food based diet filled with enough calories . the even happier news is that it is harder to over-eat on protein eating a plant based diet – something that is a big concern for meat , dairy and egg eaters.if you want to get a thorough education on protein , check out these sources : here is my favorite website for explaining all about protein . there is a section on the page that talks about the myth of the need to worry about protein combining. http : / / michaelbluejay.com / veg / protein.htmla close second , to fill in yet some more details is dr. mcdougall article from december 2003. http : / / www.drmcdougall.com / health / education / newsletter / archives / you might also check out the january 2004 newsletter article , protein overload.hope that helps.you are mischaracterizing the research you cite ! let me quote from the harvard school of public health when discussing the nurse ’ s study : “ in studies of more than 80,000 female nurses , harvard researchers found that consuming about an egg a day was not associated with higher risk of heart disease ( too few women in the study were eating more than an egg a day to evaluate the effects of higher egg intakes ) . ” the nurse ’ s study did find slightly elevated risk from eating eggs for people with existing heart disease or diabetes . i assume that your “ facts ” as presented in the video are simply taking the results for this select group and treating it as generally true when it isn ’ t.counting the minutes until you delete this comment … http : / / www.hsph.harvard.edu / nutritionsource / fats-full-story / this link seems to be broken . by the way , the harvard physicians ’ heath study found that one egg a day clearly increased all causes of mortality and fewer eggs trended in that directiondr greger , is most or all of what you present in this discussion still relevant. no new data to refute this. how about any more studies to support this ? thanks.it is all still relevant , please see these 2 videos too. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / more-than-an-apple-a-day-preventing-our-most-common-diseases / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / from-table-to-able / thankyou ! ! amazing video . thank you so much for your great review and enthusiastic presentation.thank you very much for this precious video.as the video makes clear , vegetarians are less susceptible to the most prevalent diseases in a meat-eating society . but could the roles be reversed ? is there data available on the leading causes of death for vegetarians ? and might some of these diseases be less pernicious among meat eaters ? ( ditto for non-lethal but debilitating diseases . ) putting it simply , are there any diseases which are more prevalent among vegetarians / vegans ? this is the most informative health presentation i have ever watched.11 : 12 a was laughing loud … i struggle with understanding , because my english isn ’ t good enough to understand all … but dr. greger its greati went “ mostly ” vegan last year because my husband was diagnosed with type-ii diabetes , high blood pressure and high cholesterol . we started following dr. barnard ’ s book on controlling diabetes with diet . eric followed it to the letter and everything was reversed . i didn ’ t follow it religiously because diabetes was not my issue and i had none of the other issues . so i got into a rut of eating mcdonald ’ s breakfasts and the occasional meat at lunch . if you are not totally committed to eating this way , it ’ s hard to stick to it when you are getting food from outside the home . i had no problem sticking to it at home.then , several months ago , i got the word i had plasmablastic lymphoma with a few tumors in my nose . i thought , what the heck , i am vegan and i shouldn ’ t be getting this . of course , i really wasn ’ t vegan . then , through chemo , i ended up not losing my appetite but used the chemo as an excuse to eat whatever the heck i want . which , turned out pretty much to be the worst things i could possibly eat while fighting cancer . i started eating almost exclusively ; processed meats , dairy and a lot of sugar . part of that was to overcome taste issues with the chemo . but mostly , i just used it as an excuse to go crazy.so , long story short , instead of continuing on down this road while going through the radiation , your talk inspired me to get back on track and go back to a strict whole food / plant-based diet again . as most people on here ( except for the trolls ) will tell you , the meat is the easiest thing to cut out . for me it ’ s the dairy that is the hardest.i will watch your video again tonight , but i don ’ t remember hearing anything about plant based fats . like nuts , avocado , olives . what is your take on eating that kind of thing ? barnard is pretty much against all pure and high-density fat foods.thanks.stevelittle : re : ” for me it ’ s the dairy that is the hardest . ” you are not alone ! it gets easier , especially when you learn some tricks for getting creamy textures in the food , but it can still be a hurdle for some people to give up dairy . dairy is literally addictive.i ’ m sorry to hear about your tumors . i ’ m hoping you will be able to beat it . dr. greger has several videos on this site regarding the health value of nuts . so , a good 1 to 2 ounces of nuts ( and / or seeds ) a day would fit right in with dr. greger ’ s recommendations . dr. greger doesn ’ t generally support the use of oils . but a few olives would not be remiss . there is at least one video against the use of avocadoes on this site , but i consider it to be one of the weaker videos . it hasn ’ t stopped me from enjoying some avocados now and then.here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . i think it answers your question in terms of what is stressed and not stressed in the recommendations , even if it doesn ’ t directly address “ fat ” : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps and best of luck to you . ps : thanks for the report on eric and his success in treating diabetes . that ’ s great encouragement for others in a similar predicament.stevelittle : one more bit of advice : i recommend that you search nutritionfacts specifically on the topic of cancer . while a whole plant food based diet is generally good for just about anyone , there are tweaks you can do that will help with specific conditions . so , there may be certain foods you will want to focus on specifically because of your diagnosis.many of my patient ’ s find it difficult to give up dairy … may have something to do with the main protein in cow ’ s milk , casein , being converted to 8 casomorphins ( morphine like substances ) which are absorbed into our body . about 20 % of folks are “ cheese cravers ” … eat cheese daily straight out of the package and 20 % more are “ cheese enhancers ” … adding cheese to many of their foods . you might find reading “ whitewash ” a bit illuminating and supportive of avoiding dairy as it effectively covers the wide range of problems with dairy . michael klaper md calls dairy “ baby cow growth food ” . you should also consider viewing a selection from the over 80 video ’ s on dairy on nutritionfacts.org. pcrm ’ s resource , the cancer survivor ’ s guide , is available for free download on the their website . foods low in fat will typically lead to a more ideal body weight . whole foods like nuts , avocados and olives are better then processed foods and should be consumed in moderation . good luck with your treatment and finding the correct diet.fascinating video as always – people interested in this topic may not know that there is now no doubt that what ’ s called chronic inflammation is a central cause of ( heart disease / diabetes / stroke ) and there ’ s a free report on how to prevent it at http : / / www.nutrishield.com / inflammageingthis was so amazing i am so happy to have stumbled upon it & i cannot wait to share ! ! is eating one egg in total as harmful as smoking 5 cigarettes in total or as harmful as smoking 5 cigarettes every day for 15 years ? i didn ’ t quite get that … .what do you say to someone that thinks that dietary cholesterol is good for you ? it helps make cell walls and other structural processes.derrek : the , “ your body needs cholesterol . hence dietary cholesterol is good for you . ” is an argument that we see all of the time . and it is an argument that is * very * easy to counter . the short answer is : “ yes , your body needs cholesterol . but your body makes all of the cholesterol that it needs . so , baring some serious genetic defect / disease , you don ’ t need to get cholesterol from your diet . the reverse is true : adding dietary cholesterol typically raises your body ’ s cholesterol levels above the known safe amount , which is a total 150 or below and ldl 70 or below . ” i will write out a bit more for you to help you / others put this into perspective : if people making these claims were to think it through , they are ( likely ) really making one or both of these points : 1 ) cholesterol is necessary for our bodies , and we need to eat it to get enough , and / or 2 ) cholesterol is so necessary for so many important functions in our bodies that we can ’ t have too much of it in our bodies . the higher the number the better.neither of these points is true . as stated above , we know that our bodies make all of the cholesterol that we need and that adding extra cholesterol by eating it increases our risk for disease and early death.the second point is also not true . * no one * is asking the question : do our bodies need cholesterol at all or not ? the real question is : what level of cholesterol in our blood / bodies is healthy ? is there a level that is too high so that it is associated with higher risk of disease and death ? ( too low ? – another question for another time ) and does eating cholesterol raise our body ’ s cholesterol levels above the safe amount ? to presume that there is * no * upper limit to healthy cholesterol is against all common sense . for example , our bodies * need * water . but we all know that if your body gets too much water , you can die from it . it doesn ’ t make sense to think that cholesterol would be any different . common sense tells us that there is an upper line where having too much cholesterol causes bad things to happen , just like having too much water ( a necessary ingredient for life ! ) causes bad things to happen.reasonable people can argue over where that line is for cholesterol , but it seems to me that paleo / atkins / etc people tend to argue that there is no line at all . while i and others argue that we have a mountain of evidence showing that a ) there is a line and b ) we are pretty sure that that line for the general population is : a total cholesterol below 150 with ldl below 70 in order to be heart-attack proof . i ’ ve never seen a paleo person show a study where people below 150 / 70 got heart attacks . ( might happen with a rare genetic defect . but not a pattern . ) suppose someone is willing to concede the 150 / 70 point / line for the sake of argument . they might then counter with : “ but that doesn ’ t mean that eating animal products ( ie eating dietary cholesterol ) will cause our body ’ s cholesterol levels to rise . ” the “ evidence ” that “ supports ” this statement is fatally flawed . on the other hand , there is a mountain of good evidence that counters this statement . ( check out plant positive as well as videos on this site . ) further , it is my understanding that in general , when most people eat cholesterol ( animal products ) beyond * trivial * amounts , their cholesterol levels tend to go into the danger zone ( above 150 / 70 ) . ( and based on anecdotes , i would say , once that cholesterol level goes up for years / decades on end / from childhood , it can be very hard for people to get their levels in the safe zone even after they try to change their diet . but i don ’ t know that for a fact . ) to get back to the point : yes , our bodies need cholesterol , but the belief of “ the more the better ” for body levels of cholesterol is not supported by the evidence.does that help ? excellent video on the leading causes of death . i am a 62 yo female with chronic low back pain from ddd and arthritis and fibromyalgia . both showed up after a car accident 9 yrs ago . i want to go vegan and get off the bad meds . how do i start ? i know much to ask here but i want to be pain-free , lose 50 lbs and finally be healthy , again ! u can email me directly at email on file . i really need your help and support . do you have a recipe book out on eating vegan and how to do it ? god bless you dr greger and i so appreciate all u do to help us be healthy as god intended.kathy : this website has some videos on lower back pain . as well as arthritis and fibromaylgia . you may want to check some of those out.but i can see that you are read to get off of the theory and start getting some practical advice ! here are some of my favorite resources and recommendations for people who are starting out : 1 ) consider going through the free 21 day kickstart program by pcrm . they will hold your hand for 21 days , including meal plans , recipes , videos , inspirational messages , and a forum where you can ask questions. http : / / www.pcrm.org / kickstarthome / ( click the green “ register now ” button . ) 2 ) pick some good cookbooks and start making recipes . you don ’ t have to go cold-turkey and expect that you aren ’ t going to like every recipe you try . so , just keep trying dishes until you build up a set that you really like and are easy enough for you to make . then you can just make those recipes and stop making your old ones . some cookbooks that i recommend are : let them eat vegan vegan on the cheap vegan casseroles everyday happy herbivore ( or any book in that series ) or if you have a specific condition you want to work on , there are some great books that have recipes in the back for those conditions . let me know if you want some suggestions for diabetes , heart disease , memory / dimentia or one that is good for athletes , etc . actually , the main diet is the same for all of these conditions . but it is nice to get the specific books and recommended recipes when you are first starting out so that you start to get a handle on what you are looking for in terms of what is healthy.3 ) check out some good recipe blogs . these sites have free recipes as well as some emotional support as you can read about the lives of others . here are some sites people really like : http : / / mouthwateringvegan.com / http : / / blog.fatfreevegan.com / http : / / vegan-magic.blogspot.com / there are a lot more out there ! so , keep looking until you find one or two that you like.4 ) get a copy of jeff novick ’ s fast food dvd series . jeff does a great job of giving simple , tasty , extremely healthy recipes , all in a mini cooking show format . here ’ s one to get you started : http : / / www.amazon.com / jeff-novicks-fast-food-1 / dp / b00466dp42 / ref = sr _ 1 _ 1 ? s = movies-tv & ie = utf8 & qid = 1418772380 & sr = 1-1 & keywords = fast + food + jeff + novick the burgers and fries dvd is a good one too ! 5 ) don ’ t forget your b12 supplement . here are dr. greger ’ s overall nutrition recommendations . this will give you a very general , overall game plan along with some advice on specific nutrients to make sure you have all your bases covered : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / i hope that helps.if any person thinks that one diet fits all , please show us the evidence . if any person thinks that one pill fits all , show us the evidence . if any person thinks that each person has the same microbiome , show us the evidence . i have completely won the argument against all comments on this site … .. the vegan diet , the paleo diet , the whatever diet is not going to affect each person the same … .period. so , what the hell is the answer ? the answer is that each of us will find what does work … .that ’ s the answer to all of this non sense.the minute people start saying that a certain way of eating is wrong , they have lost the argument . how many people take a medicine and it doesn ’ t work for you like it did your friend or family member ? how many people eat certain things that do not agree with you , but it ’ s fine for someone else ? if people on this site actually care about other people ’ s health , then stop your stupidity and realize that eating is different for each of us.the reality is that our gut flora is the universe to health . as the microbiome project goes forward , we will be learning what works for each individual as far as health is concerned … .stop your insanity and realize that your diet isn ’ t my diet.although we may have different genetics , we do share the same biology.however , we do not share the same microbiomes … .if you make an array of sterile petrie dishes , each with a different culture composition , then lift the lids for a few seconds and replace them , individual colonies will begin to grow . the colonies will be made up of bacteria that found that culture to its liking . all the plates were subjected to the same background exposure . but different culture media support different “ spectra ” of bacteria colonies.if you lay down a good culture medium in your gut by eating whole plant foods , if you build it , then you will select for a good microbiome … they will come.our genetics are different in each person … .. your idea falls short of that fact . our genetics will drive the microbiome to be different in each person . you cannot say that if everyone eats plants , we will all be healthy . first of all , people are not going to follow a plant based diet no matter what anyone says … .it will never happen unless people are forced at gun point . the vegans are and will always be a tiny left wing radical group with no power.you probably do want to have frequent human contact and avoid washing hands after shaking hands or handling money . and prepare your food with unwashed hands too , not as much a problem some people claim it to be as long as one is fit . and they will come ^ ^ : ) coacervate i came across a bit of yours where you divulged suffering from bipolar disorder and talked about meditation . could you tell me a bit more about that ? other coping strategies you might be willing to share ? i recently found some respite after 8 month downhill slide because of choline , but while immensely helpful not the end all to all . nobody really seems to know what exactly to do with me in my healthcare system , so after my body its time i start fixing this myself too i guess . kind of daunting , cross kind of replace with completely daunting , hypochondriac too and that is not helpful in the least.anyway , any and all pointers would be very much appreciated indeed . regards.well your sense of humor is in good health , at least i hope you were joking about the hand thing : ) glad to hear the choline is working . in my case , i was so sick i was planning to top myself and get it out of the way . so when i latched on to wfpb it was like someone tossed a lifesaver . here is the short list of what i did : quit my job – i was lucky and picked a supportive wife quit my “ friends ” – anyone who brings me needless stress is out however , a close friend is also a buddhist nun . she helped me throw away the clutter , both physical and meta , ( i am not nor ever will be religous ) . i thought about what was important to me . once sorted the needed changes were easy to do . finally , i was only able to do most of the above after the whole plant food transition . i felt good and strong again . the black days , the migraines , the gut problems , the joint pain , the meds- all gone now … . i can ’ t list all the things that have improved for me … everything … i was so happy to simply feel good i became more friendly and social.so , people do love to talk about themselves don ’ t they , heh ? i wish i could tell you for sure this is what you need … i know you are already committed to restoring your health . that is the important part . oh right , i would recommend reading comments from darryl , boomer , veganrunner and you know , the good drs and professionals on the nf team . seek out the ones who can sort out the good science from the … not so good . my spidey sense tells me you will be fine . and remember , you ’ re not superman , ya knowbut how far have you taken plant based ? i went step by step , first going after adhd grains and eggs then milk products 13 months ago , reducing meat to one moment a day and stepping down the number of days gradually . every now and then though i had to eat meat again to feel better , now with the new experiences with choline i might know why . eventually had a very nerve wrecking trial end of april stress through the roof , i must have burned all my magnesium back then . still going lower on meat or wild salmon , the more my mind went manic the more i favored the fish because of possible oil benefit over meat . but there is even less choline in fish , hindsight ^ ^ anyway eventually still going less and less frequent reduced to fish once every two weeks , and that is as vegan as i ’ ve been . 2 months into that new routine i could not control myself anymore , panicked and started eating fish regularly again . always wild caught ( frozen ) , yeah i know fish is bad but going crazy , and going by the fire on my scalp and upper spine i really was just bracing for seizures.not stupid and recognized the danger , stopped frequenting another forum and nutrition facts , stopped everything that caused stimulation of whatever kind and just binge watched stupid tv series a mystery science theater 3000 every now and then . threw out the tv 8 month before that already but now just had to stop browsing too . if anything peaked my interest to much it was just to toxic for me , talking to people toxic to me . had to stop exercise to , i really hate that part , wanting to do it but you know its just to stimulating . and then the depression comes , sigh ! even now better protected by the magnesium and choline i ’ m still in need finding my new equilibrium . i gave this site to my dentist , an ever so very friendly lady , for me after 5 years of isolation and so out of touch just , knowing what i write might be read by her can keep me up . noticed i posted to much because of re-checking things , i dunno its all so weird . everything is so uncertain , cannot plan anything because i never know how i ’ ll feel . its horrible.did you have to go vegan all the way for the difference ? i suppose i can give that a try again but this time with the choline and algea dha . i ’ m not worried about b / protein but very uncertain about the fats with regard to my adhd , seems that throws things wildly off balance.on meditation , i ’ m always just way to distracted to plan this for myself , doing it in a group also not an option . those people ask a lot of money , it all seems nothing more than luxury leisure . wellness my ass . ^ ^ arjan , i had no idea what you were up against . of course i am not qualified to give you medical advice , but i also have little faith in psychiatry . i have to ask though , have you ever been on prozac ? or has anyone in the field prescribed a med that helps subdue the peaks ? it is clear that you are not getting much traction from the “ professionals ” so i encourage you to continue to work on your own … do you keep a journal ? could be useful to record daily data on meals , activities , events , moods.i went hardcore wfpb for 2 years starting in 2011 . my worry was death from advanced heart disease . one cause was extreme stress caused by worry about death from heart disease. really . so it was easy for me to make the change . after the second year i started adding back traditional holiday meals , but i have actually lost my desire for all that crap so usually i backslide into whole plant foods even then . to answer you question , i felt so much better and in control of myself … the peaks and lows , my physical strength .. everything came back into place for me.i am really sorry that you have to fight through this . i wish there was more i could do . i ’ m at -175 , -40 ( -13 hour gmt at the moment ) … can i ask whats your time zone ? latitude ? i had a friend in northern sweden who suffered terribly in the winter . then one dr. gave him a bank of lights and practically overnight he was off prozac and doing much much better . just a thought.i just remembered something , when i was having trouble with peaks i learned to take deep breaths in trhough my nose , out through my mouth … just 5 minutes of that would bring me back to terra firma . wishing the best for you arjan.thank you very much for that extensive reply . i ’ ve given up on doctors and psychiatry for the most part too . they seem to have no clue or understanding on so many levels that communicating issues is damn near impossible.i ’ ve been on prozac for 6 years during my first “ lost years ” to anxiety . don ’ t regard it as something that has helped me much . i ’ m not keeping a journal , i probably should , but i ’ m completely hopeless in a systematic work approach . even the most simple list keeping efforts like possibly interesting supplements or foods in a wfpbd fail . probably because i just stopped paying attention to school when i started the dutch equivalent of high school.i did have a heart incident last summer which i thought was a minor infarction but i recently came across stress cardiomyopathy which now seems far more likely . to be honest i cared and still do care about atherosclerosis , fixing that making the best out of that , but “ an event ” , i die , i die , i just hope its a somewhat clean death and do not have to be too nauseous and throw up . that is pretty much my kryptonite.how hardcore wfpbd did you go ? vegan all the way ? i hardly ever eat anything processed at all anymore for quite a long while now actually , i did eventually return to a piece of wild salmon a day . but with the added choline i ’ m now experimenting with limiting that intake again , a small piece of wild fish every 3 days , and no other animal products . if there is no worsening of symptoms once a week , once every two weeks.excellent presentation . i became a vegetarian since last 8 years and became vegan since last 4 years . i can see a huge difference in my energy levels , health , and guilt free ( of eating meat ) i noticed that eating one banana per day and a handful of pumpkin seeds a day , makes a lot of difference which eliminates depression , calm down the tension etc . thank you so much for your amazing videos that help thousands of people . it really make sense how the prescription drugs makes people sick . it is happening in my family and they are trying to get out of prescription drugs . the only think bothers me is , thyroid ( hypo / hyper ) is there no cure for under active thyroid ? why do we need to take that for lifelong ? if anyone have any ideas , please share. thanks.doctor greger , i really like your talks , and this talk is especially interesting. i ’ ve also watched your talk about the 40-year vegan who died of heart attack . these days , i ’ ve heard a few online summits in which the medical professionals and researchers say that new studies have found that it ’ s not cholesterol that causes heart disease , but rather just inflammation , and that sugar is the major cause . they also say that if cholesterol is too low ( under 150 ) , the body cannot make its hormones . some doctors , particularly authors of grain brain and wheat belly , are proposing a high fat and low carb diet . and they say that saturated fat is not a problem . rather bad fat is a problem – fat from factory farms , etc . as a consequence , the “ paleo diet ” is gaining ground , and for most people , that diet means a lot of meat , butter and so on. i haven ’ t seen or heard any in-depth discussion between the two opposing camps regarding the cause of heart disease , point by point . i feel now there ’ s a great deal of confusion. i ’ ve seen a video of a debate that ended up inconclusive : http : / / www.mindbodygreen.com / 0-14351 / sugar-gluten-paleo-vegan-3-doctors-debate-the-best-way-to-eat.htmlis it possible if you have a talk on this thoroughly ? thank you so much ! next week dr. greger will have a vide addressing the paleo issue . the debate you posted is a good example of how this type of format doesn ’ t lend itself to resolution of the debate . the science is clear at this point always subject to change … that ’ s why it is important to keep tuned . the interpretation of studies can be used to support a range of positions for a sense of this see video … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-saturated-fat-studies-set-up-to-fail / . many of the “ experts ” have a minimum understanding of the issues both statistical and commercial surrounding studies . sugar has not been shown to be a problem as long as it is below 5 % of total calorie intake … although it does make a good target . it is also depends on the company it keeps see the video … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit / and the dose see … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / how-much-added-sugar-is-too-much / .thank you , doctor . that ’ s very helpful ! celia : i ’ m not sure if someone replied ot you or not . just in case you haven ’ t gotten a reply , dr. greger ’ s does have a video which directly addresses grain brain and wheat belly , but despite multiple searches , i can ’ t find it . maybe you could find it ? ? ? or someone else can and will help out ? also note that many other videos on this site indirectly address the flaws of those books by showing abundant evidence showing the healthfulness of grains and legumes and the health problems with meat.cholesterol below 150 is definitely not a problem . dr. greger has addressed this in the past and has another video on the topic coming up in the next batch. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-cholesterol-be-too-low / for a super in-depth and wonderfully scholarly work on understanding the flaws of the paleo arguments and cholesterol ’ s role in heart disease , check out plant positive ’ s work : http : / / plantpositive.com / ( the video series are listed to the right of the screen . ) hope that helps.thank you so much , thea ! that ’ s a very great help ! well what about this … http : / / www.usatoday.com / story / news / 2015 / 02 / 10 / new-dietary-cholesterol-advice / 23174871 / “ ” it ’ s the right decision , ” said steven nissen , chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the famed cleveland clinic . “ we got the dietary guidelines wrong . they ’ ve been wrong for decades . ” he noted that only 20 % of a person ’ s blood cholesterol — the levels measured with standard cholesterol tests — comes from diet . the rest comes from genes , he said . ” “ we told people not to eat eggs . it was never based on good science , ” nissen said . ” mind you im a vegan but … what about this ? what do you all think of this : “ the u.s. government is poised to withdraw longstanding warnings about cholesterol ” http : / / www.washingtonpost.com / blogs / wonkblog / wp / 2015 / 02 / 10 / feds-poised-to-withdraw-longstanding-warnings-about-dietary-cholesterol / the government agency isn ’ t going to shift unless the data / evidence is overwhelming , so i wonder how you can reconcile these various studies.the tidbit about nuts is especially interesting . such a small change in our routine can impact our health incredibly . while there are many videos on the site which explore the topic of how nuts impact health , this video is a good starter video http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / nuts-may-help-prevent-death / all i see is the word “ appears ” . this “ appears ” to cause that , etc . what that means to me is that most research is incomplete at best , highly biased in various ways and therefore agenda-based at worst . eat whatever you eat but do it all in moderation and get exercise on a regular basis.too bad this guy is such an asshole in his presentation . he belongs on the gong show.thank you doctor . your research-based analysis is compelling and i have already experienced considerable improvement in a chronic disease by implementing these strategies . what ’ s equally stunning to me is the extent those with a conflict of interest will go to try to discredit proven research to protect profit . perhaps they ’ ve had their conscience surgically removed.are you able to give an estimate of what percentage of death would be prevented for each of the top fourteen causes for death by converting to a whole foods vegan diet ? that ’ s a good question , peggy . i think it is far too hard to tell . this study reviews diet and cancer risk and mentions that dietary factors may account for up to 70 % of cancer mortality . of course , this is not looking at whole-food vegan diets , but it goes to show diet plays a dramatic role on cancer mortality and other illnesses that dr. greger describes in this video.am concerned about this new york times editorial : http : / / www.nytimes.com / 2015 / 03 / 31 / upshot / red-meat-is-not-the-enemy.html ? rref = upshot & abt = 0002 & abg = 0 please advise.i have seen this making the rounds . i ’ ll let one of dr. greger ’ s favorite cancer-specific organizations give their take , here . i agree with the bottom line from this review , which is the american institute for cancer research guideline to limit red meat to < 18 oz per week and avoid processed meat . there is convincing research linking red meat to colorectal cancer risk and this nyt article does not alter previous evidence.dr.greger , i wonder why you cater to the typical online attention span , one of the reasons people watch these videos in the first place is to improve their own brain function , including their attention span.dr. greger is brilliant.quick question … . at around 02 : 24 michael talks about a big study were the participants ate the equivalent amount of cholesterol found in one egg . this apparently resulted in a reduced life expectancy comparable to smoking 5 cigarettes a day for fifteen years . lets be clear here , eating a single egg a day is not as bad as smoking 5 cigarettes a day for fifteen years . what if the participants had a horrendous diet which resulted in the having both an amount of cholesterol equivalent to 1 egg per day and extra anti-nutrients ? exactly ! ! ! ! ! ! the proof is in the pudding , as it is eloquently said ! ! ! no more proof is needed , either , that this man is most humane , … imho. thanks so kindly for your insight ! praise is needed , where praise is deserved ! ! i found this study online that was done in austria that said their vegetarians lived shorter lives . any answers on why this study turned out that way . ( i don ’ t believe it ’ s true judging by other info i ’ ve found , but was met with some hostility from my husbands father when he found out i wasn ’ t eating meat and this is what he brought up ) here ’ s the link http : / / www.plosone.org / article / fetchobject.action ? uri = info : doi / 10.1371 / journal.pone.0088278 & representation = pdfdear dr. greger , healthy arteries , improved immune function , disease prevention ! lets go vegan , lets go ! you have changed my life for the better . i have gone from an animal product heavy diet to mostly vegan because your videos informed me of the health problems associated with animal product consumption . thank you for exposing the truth in a way only you could do , with fun and seriousness , you have kept me on the edge of my seat . there are times when i have watched your videos when i found tears in my eyes , but you lighten things up with your good humor . you have opened my eyes to so many different nutrition concerns and i have changed the way i eat and the way i cook for my family . before i started watching your videos i was eating eggs for breakfast and meat practically every meal . i thought that meat and eggs were nutritious and fundamental parts of a healthy diet . i have been studying health and nutrition for many years as a hobby . through my nutrition research i had realized that disease was linked with inflammation , and diet , but was not aware that animal products cause inflammation ! when i learned how egg , meat and dairy consumption are linked with artery clogging diseases of all kinds such as , atherosclerosis , alzheimer ’ s , heart disease , and other diseases as well like diabetes , obesity , cancer , and depression it was a very pivotal moment in my understanding of how diet can either cause or prevent disease . you are an inspiration and hero for fearlessly coming forth and teaching the powerful knowledge you have in a way that regular folks can understand . humanity is better off now that your videos are accessible to all ! when you demonstrated how diet can prevent treat and even reverse heart disease , and our top 10 killers . my mind was made up i was going vegan ! i am still on a mostly vegan plant based diet since i began watching your videos . this means i base my diet on whole plant foods ; steamed veggies , broccoli is my favorite ! , squash , whole grains like quinoa , oatmeal , brown rice , whole grain bread , pecans , peanut butter , nuts , legumes , great northern beans are my favorite beans , blueberries , red delicious apples , tomatoes , onions , garlic , turmeric , ground black pepper , and i feel so much better now ! i used to feel sluggish and lethargic after meals , because i was eating too much processed foods and meat , now that i base my meals on veggies , legumes , and whole grains i have so much more energy . the way you show how the immune systems of vegans fight cancer and infection better than those on a s.a.d. really motivated me to give vegan eating a try , and it worked ! i am trying to focus on nutrient dense , fiber rich ingredients . after a few months of experimenting i have developed a collection of easy tasty vegan recipes i can whip up in a flash . i love nutritionfacts.org ! ! ! ! ! ! you are awesome ! ! ! ! dr greger – in a couple of your videos you mention black crowberries and dog rose hips , implying these are the best anti-oxidants . is that correct ? where in the world do i get crowberries – travel to greenland and buy them from the eskimos ? and dog rose mainly grows in europe – are other rose hips just as good ? on another note : should we be getting berberine in our diets ? i hear it is the latest big thing . but do we have to inject the extract or can we just eat plants containing berberine ? and would that include oregon grape berries ? phellodendron drupes ? tree turmeric ? goldenseal tea ? goldthread ? barberries ?

PLAIN-357	can diet be used to treat kidney cancer ? i ’ ve been diagnosed as follows : papilary renal cell carcinoma . the carcinoma is metastatic ( stage iv ) . wondering if you have any subscribers know of anyone who have beaten this type / stage of metastatic cancer using diet ? any advice you have would be greatly appreciated . i need to make a decision very soon regarding traditional ( western ) treatment or a better way . thank you very much , jeff j. jeffj / originally posted in preventing kidney failure through diet the nice thing about dietary interventions is that they can be undertaken in addition to whatever you and your physician agree upon is the right course of action in your case . unfortunately i ’ m not aware of any studies on the role of diet in surviving renal cell carcinoma . i do have videos on diet for bladder cancer survival , early stage prostate cancer ( in relation to flax seeds , saturated fat , plant-based diets ) , breast cancer survival ( in relation to soy , flax seeds here , here and here , saturated fat , and trans fat ) and reversing the progression to esophageal and oral cancer , but none that cover dealing with kidney cancer because it apparently hasn ’ t been studied . however , because cancer prevention and treatment may be the same thing in many cases , i would recommend you consider eating the kind of diet that has been associated with kidney cancer prevention . for example , in the current issue of one of my favorite journals , the american journal of clinical nutrition , this question was put to the test in what may be the largest prospective study ever , the nih-aarp diet and health study , which followed nearly half a million people for about a decade . noting that “ plant-based and fiber-rich diets high in vegetables , fruit , and whole grains are recommended to prevent cancer and chronic conditions associated with renal cell carcinoma , ” the study found fiber intake was associated with a significant 15-20 % lower risk of renal cell carcinoma and that the most powerfully protective foods included legumes ( beans , chickpeas and lentils ) , whole grains , and cruciferous vegetables . refined grain intake , however , was associated with increased risk . last year the same group of researchers found that cooked meat carcinogens may double the risk of papillary renal cell carcinoma . the only other new study i know of found that nitrite from processed meats and other animal sources ( but not plant sources ) was associated with an increased risk as well . finally , given that most of the new treatments developed for renal cell carcinoma ( axitiniband , bevacizumab , everolimus , pazopanib , sorafenib , sunitinib , temsirolimus ) attempt to block the formation of new blood vessels to the tumor , that would be all the more reason to pack your diet with foods containing anti-angiogenic phytonutrients such as apigen , luteolin , and fisitin found in strawberries , citrus , celery , peppers , and many other fruits and vegetables . in my volume 13 dvd i have a video on this whole concept called cutting off tumor supply lines . it should be up on the website in a few weeks , but if you email me your mailing address i ’ d be happy to send you a copy . i am enjoying all your comments and videos , so informative . i have a soon in the fitness industry who pushes the health benefits of whole foodsdear dr , can i ask also for one of your dvd vol 12 , cuting off tumor supply line . ? i would welcome it very much.it ’ s available on my website and through amazon ( all proceeds to charity ) , but if you can ’ t afford it i ’ d be happy to send you a copy , just email me your mailing address.thank you doctor for all your unconditional information giving to all without expectation ! i wish you long years of life with health , joy and prosperity . i ’ d like to get more information on borderline kidney failure ! since september 2012 suddenly my egfr “ kidney function ” dropped to 14 which is borderline failure , creatinin and bun at 55 and 3.9 without any specific reason . i have always eaten healthy , since i have juvenile diabetes for over 40 years which has been in control as much as i was able to . i became almost all plant based for the exception of having fish once a week for the past six years since 2007 . in 2011 i took two session of chelation to improve my overall health and then this kidney issue happened . please advice me any information to help me delay and or reverse my kidneys condition . i have nightmares about the “ d ” word and possible transplant . i thank you and pray for you always . may.16.2013maybe offtopic : is there any information on affects of radiation on food ?

is he a vegetarian or vegan ? i am not but will consider his advice . thank you . appreciatively , edwardedward . welcome to the site . i too find it to be extremely helpful.i can ’ t speak for dr. greger , but i have watched every single one of his videos . i ’ m pretty sure that the answer is : for optimal nutrition , stay away from meat , dairy and eggs . here is a link to a blog post in which dr. greger gives his nutrition recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / hope that helps.your website is outstanding and has helped save my life . i am 2-1 / 2 yrs out from cancer diagnosis and treatment . i found your site and am following vegan diet . i feel great and all tests are clear . my question : i have low thyroid and am taking natural compounded porcine-based thyroid meds twice a day . am i at risk of a pork-based virus or autoimmune response from these meds ? your pork video has me concerned.kathryn , i was taking the porcine meds , too , since i had a reaction to one of the binding agents in synthroid . it bothered me that , as a vegan , i was taking animal thyroid , so i asked my doctor for an alternative . i am now on tirosint and doing well . tirosint is not vegan . in fact , tirosint is manufactured with gelatin and glycerin . however , in my humble opinion , tirosint does represent an improvement over taking pig thyroid . hope this helps.eat sea vegetables for iodine and at least an ounce of brazil nuts a day for selenium.you might have gotten hypothyroid because of the high levels of oxilates in raw vegetables ( spinach i believe has .94g / kg ) . 16-30 g / kg i believe is lethal – not an expert ! ! ! i did some googling and i ’ ve been eating raw spinach for a long time and i have bad heart palpitations … try more whole grains and try cooking or steaming your vegetables and leafy greens. you are lowering the oxilates in the vegetables and in handing absorption by cooking them as i understand it . any professionals please correct me if i ’ m wrong … .good luck . ( ps . i just found this all out yesterday – but already i haven ’ t had a palpitation this morning . ) my main point was try googling oxalates and “ the dark side of vegetables ” and you ’ ll see lots of people talking about kidney stone formation and hypothyroid with raw high oxalates diets – especially juicing . and try cooking your vegetables in 16oz of water with 1 / 4th a teaspoon of iodized salt mixed in . the vegies taste great and salty and they don ’ t need salt to sweeten them up and you get your iodine to balance the oxalates – double win . diabetics with no / low sodium diets – just cook with water and no or very little salt . don ’ t cook or fry with vegetable oils or coconut oil or olive oil – cooking with vegetable oils i believe creates trans fats – pros correct me if i ’ m wrong – which is the worst type of fat you can digest … we are lucky in america that most of the vegies we eat can be eaten raw because there are a ton of vegetables and leafy greens that are poisonous to us – but if they are cooked and the liquid discarded – they are safe ! ! ! i love science ! food for thought . god blessmay i ask your opinion of thermography for breast screening ? thank you.most likely renal cc … small spots showing at both lung bases … feellike my body is shriveling away before my eyes . will have partial nephrectomy hopefully sooner rather than later & i was told “ not to worry ” about the spots on my lungs . terrified and just don ’ t know what to think . would an extreme fast hurt or harm things ? any help about any aspect of this would greatly be appreciated.david10 years ago i was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer . a year later i heard that a whole-foods vegan diet could improve my odds of survival . i changed my diet 9 years ago … and obviously … i am still here . i can ’ t say absolutely that it why i survived , but i and my oncologist think so . he said there are studies underway now with women with breast cancer that show 30 % improvement of survival by just dropping meat intake to a low level … i would recommend that you read “ the china study ” . oh , and as a side benefit , i love my diet ! i won ’ t ever go back , even if someone assured me i wouldn ’ t get cancer . it ’ s that good ! ken , that is * such * and inspiring story . thank you so much for taking the time to share.i agree with you , the china study is awesome . i wish they would teach it in schools.happy eating to you.dear dr. greger , can diet be used to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) cancer ? gleevec has too many side effects . every time my sister eats the medicine , she has very low white blood cells so she must stop eating gleevc . she was operated on but still has high recurrence risk . many thanks ! hello , google alkaline water and try to see if your ruin and saliva is acidic or alkaline . ~ 7.3 is supposedly our constant blood level . meat , fish , eggs , dairy – cheese milk yogurt – and stress lower ph ( increase acid ) which is bad – whereas fruits , vegetables , and berries increase ph – good . dr. bernardo ( older white male veteran naturopath ) explains on youtube how he cures any disease and all cancers with a high vegetable based ph and a positive change in attitude . sounds like a great american ! ! ! ! good luck and god bless ! vegan diet does support optimal health and can be considered as a part of cancer management . the causal result relationship between any type of cancer and diet has been shown in many studies . here is a link to dr. greger ’ s video on diet and kidney cancer.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-diet-protect-against-kidney-cancer / - - -
PLAIN-370	do microgreens have more nutrition ? what about microgreens ? vetstud / originally posted in antioxidants sprouting up usda researchers recently published a study assessing the nutrition content of 25 commercially available microgreens , seedlings of vegetables and herbs that have gained popularity in upscale markets and restaurants . just a few inches tall , they boast intense flavors and vivid colors , but what about their nutritional content ? no one knew until this new study came out . we ’ ve known that baby spinach , for example , have higher levels of phytonutrients than mature spinach leaves , but what about really baby spinach , just a week or two old ? microgreens won hands down ( leaves down ? ) , possessing significantly higher nutrient densities than mature leaves . for example , red cabbage microgreens have a 6-fold higher vitamin c concentration than mature red cabbage , and 69 times the vitamin k. microgreens are definitively more nutrient dense , but are often eaten in small quantities . even the healthiest garnish isn ’ t going to make much of a difference to one ’ s health . and microgreens may go for $ 30 a pound ! but byom — birth your own ! you can have rotating trays of salad you can snip off with scissors . it ’ s like gardening for the impatient — fully grown in just 7 to 14 days ! if that ’ s too long , what about sprouting ? see my video antioxidants sprouting up . homemade sprouts are probably the most nutrition-per-unit-cost we can get for our money . see biggest nutrition bang for your buck , where they beat out the previous champ , purple cabbage ( superfood bargains ) . broccoli sprouts are probably the best — see for example the best detox and sulforaphane from broccoli to breast . i would recommend against alfalfa sprouts ( even when home sprouted ) as fecal bacteria from manure can hide in the seed ’ s nooks and crannies and cause illness : don ’ t eat raw alfalfa sprouts . i have recently heard both positives and negatives about using maca powder . are there really any solid benefits of its use ? thanksi would also like to know your stance on maca root powder . some online sources say it ’ s a great “ adaptogen ” and so i ’ ve been adding it to my morning smoothies . are there any real studies / research on this ? or is maca another internet cure-all scam ala coconut oil ? is sprouted wheat healthier than regular ground wheat ? that is after the small root begins to appear and when it is no longer than the grain itself , does the wheat grain develop added benefits when sprouted ? sprouting does indeed increase the antioxidant content of foods significantly . chickpeas can have 10x the antioxidant content when sprouted. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / antioxidants-sprouting-up / what is your opinion on juicing ?

not as long as you have an adequate intake of vitamin b12 . check out the series of video ’ s that dr. greger posted in february 2012 . there however an indirect connection to lower back issues and diet that goes beyond vitamin b12 . check out the video on arterial disease and back pain … http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cholesterol-and-lower-back-pain / . since the disc ’ s between the vertebrae get their nutrition by diffusion any interference with the blood supply to the lower vertebrae will result in more likelihood of disc narrowing and rupture with subsequent sciatica . arterial disease starts in childhood … see http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / heart-disease-starts-in-childhood / and the pday study showed aortic disease by age 19 and much worse at age 35 . obviously the earlier you begin the correct diet with adequate vitamin b-12 intake the better.dr greger : first of all , love your site and your videos . your charity to the world is just awesome . thanks for educating the populous regarding health and nutrition related issues.however , from the many dozens of videos that i have watched in which you talk about foods that are helpful or harmful to the body , the studies are based on single foods of food types ( veggies , nuts , fruits , etc ) . are there any studies as to the good for you foods offsetting bad for you foods when you combine ? i try to be good as often as i can but now and then i run into something like a broccoli slaw with raisins , sunflower seeds , onion , and then of course people have to put bacon in it too . clearly i could just pick the bacon out but the bacon is out numbered 50 to 1 as far as good to bad , so do i just eat the slaw and hope that next time there is a meatless option ? or , sometimes there only good option happens to have dairy in it , i.e. pasta with a nice tomato , basil , garlic , oregano sauce . do i not eat at all , or is the once and awhile bad thing that happens to come with much goodness ok ? most foods seem to be vegetarian with vegan being sporadic and difficult to run into when going to dinner or to friends homes to eat . even something as simple as salads – not everyone has all the good stuff such as fats from nuts or avocado when they have salads . is it better or worse to not eat salad at all , or eat the salad with a little of their vinaigrette and hope that the processed fats , in little amounts of dressing , only serves to help my body take in more of the fat soluble nutrients ? should i race home and power down a nutrient dense cocktail through my juicer ? side note – at home i am very strict so i am also hoping that my strictness inside my own walls is enough to counter the effects of not being militaristic when i am out and about with friends or family.what are your thoughts on the issue of having to sometimes live with combined foods from time to time or are their studies that deal with this ? many thanks in advance ! mjs _ 28s : i can ’ t answer your direct question , but i have an idea for you : a lot of restaurants will make you a custom dish if you just call ahead and ask for a vegan dish . “ hi , i ’ ll be coming to your restaurant tomorrow with some friends . while my friends eat anything , i do not eat meat , diary or eggs . i saw your menu and was wondering if you could modify dish _ _ _ to includes lots of bla and bla , but leave out the bla . you could even add bla to make up for the lack of bla . can you do that ? ” not all restaurants will do this , but many will , especially the higher-end ones.it ’ s just an idea to get you it all : a pleasant time with friends and family , a very tasty meal , etc . , without having to compromise on your values ( of good health , etc . ) . - - -
PLAIN-382	is vanilla almond milk healthy ? how about almond milk ? been drinking as replacement for cow milk , love the taste , etc . however , i do buy the vanilla sweetened flavor … is that bad ? am i taking away from the good of it all ? mercman40 / originally asked in the best nut almond milk is certainly superior to calf ’ s milk , if only because of the lack of saturated animal fat , cholesterol , and hormones ( see , for example , my videos acne & cancer connection and trans fat , saturated fat , and cholesterol : tolerable upper intake of zero ) , but is unflavored , unsweetened almond milk preferable to sweetened vanilla ? in general , i ’ m in favor of cutting down on intake of empty calories whenever possible . we get only about 2,000 in the calorie bank every day – why not try to make them count ? so almond milk versus almond milk with added sugar is a no-brainer decision for me , but i guess it depends on what you ’ re using it for . if the only way you would drink green tea is with the sweetened variety , then overall it would be healthier for you to stick with the added sugar ( though your taste buds would probably adapt to the unsweetened variety , or you could try adding a harmless noncaloric sweetener such as erythritol ( see a harmless artificial sweetener ) ) . the vanilla question is interesting , though . given its popularity , i was surprised there wasn ’ t more science published on the health effects of vanilla orchid fruit phytonutrients . there are two in vitro studies that suggest vanillin , one of the many aromatic compounds in vanilla , may be protective against colorectal and cervical cancer , but no clinical or epidemiological studies have been published to my knowledge . there was also a study showing that vanilla extract may interfere with bacterial communication , concluding vanilla “ might promote human health by … preventing bacterial pathogenesis . ” the most unusual vanilla study may be one published out of germany in 1999 . researchers wanted to know if our olfactory memory goes back even further than our verbal memory . do we subconsciously remember tastes and smells from our infancy before we could even put them into words ? they realized that there was a time certain german infant formulas were flavored with vanilla , so they challenged a group of adults with a vanilla-containing food . but they couldn ’ t just use your typical vanilla flavored confection because it could introduce too many other new variables . they had to choose something that no one would have ever associated with vanilla . so they concocted … vanilla-flavored ketchup ! and guess what ? two-thirds of those bottle fed with vanilla as infants preferred the vanilla ketchup , whereas two thirds of the rest were like “ blech ! ” and chose the regular ketchup . the moral of the story is that perhaps if breastfeeding women eat lots of healthy foods , their broccoli-flavored breast milk might get remembered years down the road ! and indeed i even have a new video about that : the best baby formula . almond milk comes in 4 varieties in my store , plain unsweetened , vanilla unsweetened ( both 40 cal / serving ) , plain semi-sweet ( 60 cal / serving ) and fully sweetened vanilla ( 90 cal / serving ) . we , like mercman40 , like the vanilla flavor , but don ’ t really care for the unsweetened version and the fully sweet version taste like we are drinking melted ice cream ( good in a horrific kind a way ) . the semi-sweet is “ just right ” on the sweet scale , so we remedy the lack of vanilla by adding a teaspoon of our own vanilla extract to each half gallon . but i might have to try adding some non-calorie sweetener to the unsweetened vanilla and skip the extra teaspoon of sugar.please consider that when you are drinking store bought almond milk , you are most likely consuming added synthetic vitamins. it is high-time the consumer demanded ( suggested kindly ) to the producer to stop adding synthetic vitamins to our almond milk , as well as tons of other vegan products.yes ! i ’ ve been thinking this , as well . the only exception i don ’ t personally mind is b12 , and i suppose i can live with d being added to stuff as well . beyond that , no thank you ! it ’ s frustrating … dr. mcdougall has flat out said that vitamin d supplements should be avoided , as in , don ’ t swallow anything that is either a vitamin d pill or a product that has been fortified with it . read the info. on his website . he thinks vitamin d supplements actually cause harm . not “ correlation ” , but “ harm ” . he is very clear on this.you mentioned erythritol , what about mannitol as a sweetener- is it safe ? one of my neuro psychology professors told us that artificial sweeteners aren ’ t the best because they can cause you to crave more sweetner than if you at regular sugar . i use stevia , but am sugar free totally , and noticed a new product called “ truvia ” . i looked splenda etc in the fda book that is really informational about all the additives , the studies done , etc and it says has caused cancer in rats .. like what doesn ’ t right ? i urge you to read dr. mercola ’ s research on splenda . i would not trust truvia either , nor would i true nu-stevia , which is made from corn.i have lots of green leaf stevia , but no longer use it , because the teas i buy are already sweet , and i ’ m fine with plain purified water and eating lots of fresh fruit . hence , i no longer crave extra sweetening agents.i nearly lost my vision from aspartame and don ’ t trust any artificial sweetener , as a result.mr. mercola is not a doctor.dr. mercola is an osteopathic physician . osteopaths are licensed to practice medicine in all 50 states and are recognized in sixty other countries , including all canadian provinces.http : / / www.aacom.org / about / osteomed / pages / default.aspxyou may not agree with some of his positions , but he is still a doctor.not everything causes cancer . but splenda was created to be a pesticide . however the “ tester ” misunderstood when told to “ test ” it . he thought he was told to “ taste ” it . and when tasting splenda , it was found to be sweet . hence , instead of being marketed to kill weeds , fungi , bacteria , or insects , it was labeled as an artificial sweetener . this according to research gathered by dr. mercola.not everything solely causes cancer . something may damage your immune system ( which i believe is 70 % of your gut ) , it may cause neurological damage and damage the brain and central or peripheral nervous system before it builds up enough in your body to actually cause cancer.this makes me wonder why you have come to dr. greger ’ s web site if you don ’ t care about your health in the first place.i don ’ t have cancer to my knowledge , but i have osteoporosis , which has serious consequences so i ’ m eating more healthy than ever before and am doing more weight bearing exercise.given how many artificial sweeteners made their way into the marketplace , i avoid them all together . splenda was originally created to be a pesticide , but when the tester was told to test it , he misunderstood and tasted it , found it to be sweet , and hence the product which was designed to kill or cause harm to pests , was created as an artificial sweetener.truvia has an equally sordid history.i have re-educated my taste buds by eating more nutrition fruit and occasionally adding small amounts dried fruit to sweeten beverages.rats are used as surrogates for humans . for example , and recent study bycriigen study links gm maize and roundup to premature death and cancer.http : / / sustainablepulse.com / 2012 / 09 / 19 / criigen-study-links-gm-maize-roundup-premature-death-cancer / # .ulsikhcl01othe variety of gmo maize ( corn ) used in this study has been deregulated and is in the marketplace ( grocery stores and supermarkets ) in the usa , and around the world . no peer reviewed safety testing has been published in the usa . the fda and usda have ignored the studies of this esteemed french research facility and the scientists who meticulously did the studies.for more about criigen , see : http : / / criigen.org / siteen / i no longer buy corn , since this sweet corn is grown in southeastern and northeastern u.s.a. and gmo corn and soy has been illegally planted in national wildlife refuges with the approval of the us government under the obama-monsanto administration so that the pollen would contaminate farms , fields , and backyard gardens throughout the country and continent.get involved . support the right to know about gmo ’ s in food . i contributed to the yes on 522 in washington state . hurry before there is no safe food to eat anywhere.i regularly use unflavored unsweetened almond milk in recipes . ideally i ’ d like to make my own ( amygdalate recipes date back to the 14th century le viandier de taillevent , where its the primary “ milk ” ) , but most often just use the prepared versions for convenience.for those who don ’ t care for the chalky taste added by calcium carbonate supplementation in the silk and almond breeze brands , the whole foods 360 private label uses tricalcium phosphate , which i find less objectionable in creamy soups.why not just make your own ! . go to “ straight up foods.com ” cathy fischer has recipes on her site for all non-dairy milks .. i have been making my own rice milk for a few years now … brown rice and h20silk is one of the companies who contributed to give american citizens no right to know whether or not there food is genetically engineered to resist more toxic herbicides , such as round-up , dicamba or 2,4-d – the last know known to be contaminated with dioxins , the most toxic chemical every created by humankind and 2,4-d is an agent orange ingredient from the vietnam war . i drink purified water because don ’ t trust drinking products made by corporations who want to keep the public controlled and ignorant.all the nondairy milks we have available to us ( unless we make our own ) have vitamin a palmitate as an ingredient . shouldn ’ t we be avoiding vitamin a supplements ? i found in silk , only the unsweetened , original flavor contain no carrageenan . wish dr. greger would do a piece on this subject.i don ’ t know if this matters to you . but the corporation which makes silk , dean foods , inc . , contributed to the right ( not ) to know if genetically modified organisms are in their food . dean foods weighed in financially opposed to both states and the federal government ’ s labeling gmo ’ s in food.i take this as they have something to hide ! i realize that silk is sold as both organic and non-gmo , but it is not verified by the non-gmo project , to my knowledge.the usda has allowed some foods to contain some gmo ’ s , as well as synthetic ingredients . the usda has ignored the public in favor of big business on this stance as well as claiming carrageenan is safe because the fda said it was . they have ignored the health effects that people are experiencing . this to me is not surprising , given the revolving doors at the fda.numerous recent studies on gmo soy have uncovered very severe health damage to test animals , livestock , and humans . look at the severe birth defects as a result of ingesting gmo soy in danish pigs , and an infant in argentina at : http : / / gmoevidence.com / given the games played at the u.s. fda with monsanto ’ s michael taylor as food czar , and the coziness of the secretary of agriculture to monsanto , i have chosen to avoid all silk soy in particular , and all but eden organic soy in general.eden organic tests their soy beans to make certain they do not contain gmo ’ s . they are double certified organic , but not certified by the usda because the usda has undermined the rule of the law , the national organic foods and production act of 1990.with regards to carrageenan , the cornucopia institute has put out this report , “ how a “ natural ” food additive is making us sick . ” http : / / www.cornucopia.org / wp-content / uploads / 2013 / 02 / carrageenan-report1.pdfthey have tried to get the usda and fda to take carrageean out of organic food , but to no avail.our health is a political football putted back and forth between the usda and us fda , regardless of administration in the white house.could you please do a video on which dairy-free milk is healthiest ? what about the carageenan in commercially-prepared almond milk ? i have not been able to find any source for almond milk that does not contain this artificially altered seaweed derivative , other than my own kitchen.the wholefoods and traderjoes brand do not contain carageenan , but unfortunately they only sell them at their own stores . the wholefoods one is also organic.thank you , jesse _ grimes , i ’ ll have to check it out next time i am at whole foods . unfortunately , the nearest store is almost 2 hours away from me . in the meantime , i make my own almond milk at home and it is pretty tasty.my daughter bought a vita-mix blender which has a high speed motor and uses an polyester plastic jar which i find questionable . but , she makes her own almond milk with water that has been purified through ro and carbon filtration and raw “ certified organic ” almonds . the best almonds are those grown and produced by the organic method under the law , but the usda often does not follow the rule of the law.i too have a vita-mix and it works great for so many things . that ’ s awesome that you guys make your own too . i also wondered about the plastic container but when looking into it apparently it has too much power that it would crack any glass . makes sense i guess but would love to see it made of something different.i just looked at the ingredients list on my 2 favorite milk substitutes ( blue diamond vanilla almond breeze & pacific original hemp ) and noticed they both have vitamin a palmitate added to them . in another video dr. greger mentioned that vitamin a palmitate added to skim milk is suspected in weakening people ’ s bones . i wonder if there was any confirmation on that theory ? i have a question to ask about my loss of appetite . i have chronic pain from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue . over the past 10 years i slowly lost my appetite for meat , fish , fast food , restaurant food and frozen foods . i pretty much live on just a few types of foods now . my typical daily meals consist of zero percent fat greek yogurt with cut up apples or grapes mixed in a couple times a day . i sometimes will have a bowl of organic shredded wheat with low fat organic milk with hemp hearts and flax on top . i really don ’ t eat much more then that except for fresh fruit . do you know what would cause this ? can medication ruin your appetite ? i don ’ t cook anymore because the smell bothers me unless it is apple pie or something i like . i am still about 20 lbs overweight and i ’ m not dieting . my bloodwork is normal except i am a bit iron deficient and my vitamin d is low and has been for years . i have never been able to donate blood because of my low iron . i take a vitamin daily . is what i am eating dangerous ? it is the only thing that appeals to me other then sweet things which i try and stay away from.commercial milk , almond or cow , is pasteurized – no enzymes – basically a non-food with heat-damaged minerals and vitamins , difficult for digestion and acid forming in the body . in fact your body will draw calcium from your bones to neutralise the acid and correct the ph to more alkaline ( osteoporosis ) . baby cow ’ s die when fed pasteurized cow ’ s milk . research dr tim o ’ shea / dr robert young for further information and stop drinking commercial milk … and btw your commercial fruit juice organic or not , freshly squeezed or not is also pasteurized ! squeeze your own oranges at home and make your own nut milk from raw sprouted nuts and drink raw unpasteurized dairy from an organic source.also , read your labels to avoid the additive carrageenan . not all companies use the same ingredients . the silk brand is carrageenan free. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / is-carrageenan-safe / i couldn ’ t find vanilla in the ingredient list on the silk almond vanilla ( unsweented ) brand . just “ natural flavors ” whatever that means . - - -
PLAIN-394	should we take algae supplements for astaxanthin ? is any research available on astaxanthin which seems to be touted as a wonderful antioxidant ? markb / originally posted below dragon ’ s blood astaxanthin is the reason flamingos are pink ( or at least flamingos in the wild ; in the zoo they may be fed artificial dyes like farmed salmon – see my video artificial coloring in fish ) . astaxanthin is also the reason some crustacean shells turn red when boiled . one need not eat flamingo feathers or lobster exoskeletons , though . you can go right to the source and get it from green algae such as chlorella ( i recommend against blue-grean algae and spirulina – see for example my videos is blue-green algae good for you ? and another update on spirulina ) . a review last month suggests a wide range of beneficial effects , though one should note the author is listed as a dietary supplement industry consultant . with a few exceptions , i recommend against taking supplements as they have been found in some cases to be less effective ( see , for example , my produce not pills ) or even deleterious ( see is vitamin d the new vitamin e ? and my other 60 videos on supplements ) . one should take advice from health food store employees with a grain of himalayan pink salt : summarized in my blog health food store advice : often worthless or worst . “ with a grain of himalayan pink salt ” . funny ! : ) i take an astaxanthin supplement and i have noticed the brown age spots on my skin have lightened considerable and i don ’ t burn nearly as easily as i used to . the astaxanthin i take is an extract from an algae called haematococcus pluvialis.i ’ ve been taking astaxanthin for about six months . unlike the case with other supplements , astaxanthin proponents make a claim that is easily testable : . protection from sunburn . a couple months ago i was at laguna seca raceway watching the continental tire series challenge . it was a beautiful summer day so i decided to put it to the test . at 11 : 30 am i removed my shirt , exposing a 60 year old torso that hadn ’ t seen the light of day for more than a few minutes at a time for decades . i expected to have to cover up after about 20 minutes but , not seeing any sign of irritation , i kept going . i continued to check myself at frequent intervals . finally after two topless hours i called it quits . the next day i had no more than a pinkish hue . normally i ’ d have been peeling within a few days but it never happened . suffice to say i have continued taking astaxanthin.hello. would you recomend people to change their table salt for himalayan salt if they wanted to use salt ? or do you think normal salt has the same nutritional benefits as table salt.withc is the “ better ” option ? lots of lovethink a little further : i ’ m not an expert , but here is my understanding : enriched table salt has iodine added . many americans do not get enough iodine . so , if you are going to eat salt no matter what and you have a normal american diet , then you might as well eat normal iodine-enriched salt to make sure you get enough iodine.while himalayan or other specialty / sea salts have a lot of good press , what i have seen suggests that the extra minerals in those salts are a ) trivial and b ) inconsistent . so , you wouldn ’ t want to rely on those salts for a specific mineral.which leads to the real issue , in my opinion , and which i think you already know since you wrote “ better ” in quotes : neither is really all that good for you . arguing over which type of salt is better for you is like arguing whether maple syrup or sugar is better for you . or olive vs canola oil . the answer for all practical purposes is : neither because the differences are so minor in the big picture . with a healthy diet , you don ’ t need ( and you are better off without ! ) any table salt . or sugar / syrup . or oil.another way of looking at it is like this : suppose foods were rated on health scale form 0 being it has zero-value-what-so-ever ( and likely harms you short or long term ) and 100 being the best-food-ever . i don ’ t know what the actual numbers would be for table salt , sweeteners , and oils , but to argue the difference between different types is like arguing between a 2 and a 3 . i suppose you could make a legitimate arguement that one food is a 2 and the other food is a 3 . but is that worth the breath ? that ’ s just my 2 cents . i hope it helps . - - -
PLAIN-406	can hibiscus tea cause coughing ? an fyi . my mother used to take lasinopril ( sp ? ) for high blood pressure . it gave her a terrible dry cough and she quit taking it . then i read hibiscus tea was good for high blood pressure and bought her tea where hibiscus was the 2nd ingredient . then one day i found one where it was all hibiscus tea and bought that . it made her dry cough come back ( so the active ingredient in lasinopril must come from hibiscus ) . anyway , if you develop an unknown cough , it could be from the hibiscus tea. cbetter / originally posted on better than green tea ? the mechanism of action for the blood pressure lowering effect of hibiscus tea does appear to be the same ( at least in part ) as that very drug . both hibiscus and lisinopril act to inhibit an enzyme called ace . when our kidneys detect a drop in blood pressure they release an enzyme called renin into our bloodstream which converts a protein secreted by our liver into something called angiotensin-i which in our lungs is converted into angiotensin-ii by our angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) . that angiotensin ii then acts to constrict our arteries and boost our blood pressure – isn ’ t our body neat ? anyway , lisinopril ( and the anthocyanin phytonutrients that so brilliantly color hibiscus flowers ) inhibits ace , preventing the formation of angiotensin ii and subsequent rise in blood pressure . but that ’ s not all ace does ; it also degrades bradykinins , which can increase cough reflex sensitivity . so that ’ s the reason ace inhibiting drugs may cause coughing in up to a third of users and it makes sense that hibiscus could cause a similar reaction . plants can be powerful ! ( check out my video power plants ) . so there ’ s definitely science to back up your intuition cbetter – thanks so much for sharing ( and letting me geek out on physiology : ) . if she develops a chronic cough on hibiscus , she should stop drinking it . i talk about a diet-based approach to curing hypertension in my 2012 presentation uprooting the leading causes of death . thank you dr. greger . i have end stage copd . i went on a plant base diet 1 month ago . today , i am able to walk around my home . this is huge for me . i have basically been confined to bed for 2 years . i have been amazed as to how long i am able to stand , and move around . there really is something to this plant based program . i am still creating a complete program of cooking interesting foods . i have been able to stay on the program , so far . saw your article and decided to give it a try . my pulmonary dr is with unc health care , chapel hill , nc . his name is dr. james donohue , he knew of work being done , and some of the studies . i can ’ t wait to share all this with him . he is a fellow of the american college of chest physicians and a member of the american thoracic society , and the european respiratory society . he is a reviewer and writer for several journals including the american journal of respiratory and critical medicine , the new england journal of medicine , archives of internal medicine , the southern medicine journal , chest , and the journal of respiratory disease , anin addition , dr donohue served as a writer and reviewer for the medical knowledge self-assessment program in subspecialty of pulmonary and critical medicine for the american thoracic society and the aerican college of chest physicians . this teaching and research interest include sarcoid , interstitial lung diseases , copd , alpha-1 antitry deficiency , asthma . i have been very lucky to have his as a dr. and i can wait to share all i have been doing , in addition to him seeing me able to walk , stand , and talk without oxygen . to me it is totally amazing . i am hoping to brillant dr.s may someday talk and share the benefits of a plant based diet for others who are suffering and dying from copd . joan , sanford , ncthank you so much for sharing your story and please never hesitate to contact me if there is ever anything else i can do for you.i am a copd suffer too . can you share your diet plan here ? thanks.this is why nutritional science needs to be taught in schools ; from an early age.well said ! : ) should people on lisinopril limit their hibiscus tea intake ? i take lisinopril , am part of the 1 / 3 that seems subject to coughing episodes ( only occasionally ) . can i substitute the hibiscus tea to be my ace inhibitor and forget the lisinopril ? thanks so much for this site . terrific info , am passing it on as often as possible.how does one reduces pain from “ shingles ” . my aunt is 91 years of age and suffers from “ shingles ” . thanks for any advice . gerardi drank. i coughed. now i know why. thanks.is the coughing on hibiscus tea an issue other than annoyance ? i heard that coughing might be suppressed by eating dark chocolate , supposedly because it contains bromelaine . don ’ t know if there is any science to back it up though . - - -

PLAIN-43	organic milk and prostate cancer researchers have expressed concern that since cow ’ s milk contains estrogens , dairy could stimulate the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors . the thought is that the consumption of dairy products could both “ promote the conversion of precancerous lesions or mutated cells to invasive cancer and enhance the progression of hormone-dependent tumors . ” this was initially postulated based on suggestive population-scale data like a 25 fold increase in prostate cancer in japan since world war ii . what was happening to their diets during that period ? a 5 , 10 , and 20 fold increase in eggs , meat , and dairy consumption , respectively , whereas the rest of their diet remained pretty stable . but diet wasn ’ t the only major change in japanese lifestyles over the latter half century . similarly , even though countries with higher milk consumption tend to have more prostate cancer deaths and countries with lower milk consumption fewer deaths , there could be hundreds of confounding variables . but it certainly does spur interest in studying the possibility . a recent study from clemson university represents the other extreme , controlling for as many factors as possible by isolating prostate cancer cells out of the body in a petri dish and dripping cow milk on them directly . the researchers chose organic cow ’ s milk , because they wanted to exclude the effect of added hormones so that they could test the effect of all the growth hormones and sex steroids found naturally in milk . they found that cow ’ s milk stimulated the growth of human prostate cancer cells in each of 14 separate experiments , producing an average increase in cancer growth rate of over 30 % . in contrast , almond milk suppressed the growth of these cancer cells by over 30 % . but just because something happens in a petri dish or a test tube doesn ’ t mean the same thing happens in a person . it ’ s just suggestive evidence that we can use in a grant application to get money to study actual people . this can be done with a retrospective ( looking backward ) study where we take prostate cancer patients and figure out what they ate in the past , or a prospective ( looking forward ) study where we look at people ’ s diets first and follow them for a few years and see who gets cancer . the looking back kind are typically referred to as case-control studies , because researchers look at cases of cancer and compare their diets to controls . the looking forward kind are often called cohort studies because a cohort of people is followed forward . then , if we want to get fancy , we can do a so-called meta-analysis , where you combine all the best studies done to date and see what the balance of available evidence shows . the latest meta-analysis of all the best case control studies ever done on the matter concludes that milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer . and the latest meta-analysis of all the best cohort studies ever done also concludes that milk consumption is a risk factor for prostate cancer . an even newer study profiled in my video , prostate cancer and organic milk vs. almond milk , suggests that milk intake during adolescence may be particularly risky in terms of potentially setting one up for cancer later in life . despite hormone-related cancers being among our top killers , as pointed out in the journal of the national cancer institute , “ we simply do not know which hormones , and how much , are in the food that we ingest . more effort has been directed at the investigation of illicit use of designer steroids by olympians and ballplayers than to the investigation of the effect of dietary hormones on cancer and other diseases that affect millions . ” a proposal is therefore made to monitor levels of steroid and other hormones and growth factors in all dairy and meat-containing foods , though to date this has not been done . i touched previously on the prostate cancer data in one of my oldest videos , slowing the growth of cancer . other factors may play into the link between cancer and dairy consumption including industrial pollutants ( industrial carcinogens in animal fat ) and igf-1 ( how plant-based to lower igf-1 ? ) , but for more on the hormones in dairy see : what about all the studies suggesting milk “ does a body good ” ? see my video food industry “ funding effect ” . i can ’ t play the video … .this is a blog entry only , without a video . however the names of related previously published videos are mentioned within the text and you can view these by clicking on them.there is no video it is an article.article titled “ organic milk and prostate cancer ” , yet no mention of organic milk . almond milk only alternative mentioned … it ’ s in the fourth paragraph , second sentence “ the researchers chose organic cow ’ s milk … ” the reference is here : “ the researchers chose organic cow ’ s milk , because they wanted to exclude the effect of added hormones so that they could test the effect of all the growth hormones and sex steroids found naturally in milk . ” in the 4th paragraph , organic milk also contains naturally occurring estrogen , the amount is dependent upon the gestation period in which the cow is milked. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / ? term = naturally + occurring + estrogen + in + raw + milkwhat role might the phytoestrogens in soy and other plant based foods have in tumor growth ? in epidemiological studies , soy consumption is shown to both prevent cancer as well as increase survival rates in those already diagnosed . in vitro studies using isolated soy phytoestrogens show favorable epigenetic effects and enzymatic inhibition . by overwhelming scientific consensus , it can be stated that the soy phytoestrogens , as well as those found in other foods such as flaxseeds and other beans , are protective against cancer.http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / brca-breast-cancer-genes-and-soy / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / breast-cancer-survival-and-soy / http : / / link.springer.com / article / 10.1007 / s11064-010-0142-2 # page-1they play no role at all , they are not actual estrogens . that dairy industry talking point has been debunked . see here : https : / / vimeo.com / 111054783 and here : https : / / vimeo.com / 109373842um … doesn ’ t look like you read the article very carefully . definitely does mention organic milk.i ’ m wondering if the nuclear bomb hitting japan might have beenlinked to cancer increasesi lost what i ’ ve just typed i think , the information on the correlation between the atomic bomb , fukushima etc can be found at : http : / / www.rerf.or.jp / index _ e.html with a lot of conjoint research between the u.s and japan . you can select english or japanese version of the site at the top right hand corner of the website . another site from japan confirms dr g ’ s report about dairy , meat , fat may be linked with prostate cancer . they also mentioned calcium , i am not a dr so unsure of which type . they also mentioned an animal protein called igf-1 , which is linked with prostate cancer.has there been any studies using raw milk vs almond milk ? i ’ ve read ( e.g. in an article by dr. mirkin – well known sports medicine doctor ) that for some reason , there ’ s no evidence yogurt has the same effect . i ’ d appreciate hearing from anyone with information on this.did dr. mirkin provide any sources for that claim ? from what i understand , the main problem with dairy is its signalling proteins – specifically , leucine , which stimulates igf-1 and mtor growth signalling. https : / / eatandbeatcancer.wordpress.com / 2014 / 07 / 23 / anti-cancer-diets-whats-the-deal-with-dairy / yes , dr. mirkin always provides references . i located his blog post and got the reference. http : / / drmirkin.com / men / is-lifestyle-responsible-for-our-epidemic-of-prostate-cancer.htmlhttp : / / www.jurology.com / article / s0022-5347 ( 14 ) 02524-5 / pdf pd31-06 dairy intake and prostate cancer risk : results from the california collaborative prostate cancer studygood question ! one of my projects as graduate student in nutrition was a review of the literature on dairy foods and prostate cancer risk , so to my knowledge there is some evidence for yogurt but not as much as there is on dairy foods as a group or milk in particular . many of the studies that look at dairy consumption combine yogurt with other dairy foods and do not analyze it separately . other studies do look at yogurt separately but have a very narrow range of intake in their study , making it difficult to draw conclusions about risk . to illustrate , i have linked a couple of the larger studies below.the multiethnic cohort study did not show an association between yogurt consumption and prostate cancer risk , but the highest grouping of intake was > 40 grams per day ( less than 1 / 4 cup ) .in contrast , the epic study did show a significant increase in risk with higher consumption of yogurt ( 17 % increased risk for the highest intake group with a median of 57 grams per day ) .if you are interested , the review i did was published in oncology nutrition connection and you can access it here . the section i originally wrote on yogurt was not included , however , as they were looking for a shorter article and the evidence for yogurt was simply not as robust as other dairy foods.raslam : this post is really helpful because a lot of people have posted questions on nutritionfacts about dairy yogurt in particular as opposed to dairy in general . that ’ s cool that you have looked into the issue so deeply ( or as deep as exists right now ) . thanks for sharing.thanks very much ! your comments and links are very helpful.hi david ! it may be helpful to think of all the health problems created by dairy use rather than specific dairy foods being higher in this or that cancer . the milk protein itself , casein , accounts for 87 % of milk is naturally carcinogenic.in addition to prostate cancer , dairy causes cardiovascular disease [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / the-saturated-fat-studies-buttering-up-the-public / ] , [ [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / blocking-the-first-step-of-heart-disease / ] , autoimmune issues , allergy issues , crib death and autism [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / cows-milk-casomorphin-and-autism / ] , hormone issues [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / estrogen-in-meat-dairy-and-eggs / ] , saturated fat , trans-fat [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / trans-fat-in-meat-and-dairy / ] , cholesterol , hormones [ http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / dairy-hormonal-interference / ] , and puss.thanks for the feedback . i agree with you , and am very concerned about prostate cancer . but diary is known to reduce gout flare ups and so for a vegan like me who has had them , it seems natural to think about eating some dairy . i was surprised to read one study that found vegans have higher uric acid levels than meat or fish eaters , and vegetarians the lowest of all dietary types ( perhaps because of dairy ) . perhaps that was so because many of the vegans in the study were eating refined carbs , but i don ’ t think this was investigated . anyway , that ’ s what sparked my interest in low / no fat yogurt as perhaps the least harmful dairy product overall with one positive benefit for those with gout.i thought uric acid came from the break-down of proteins … ( not carbs ) ? here ’ s a link to a good description : http : / / www.whfoods.com / genpage.php ? tname = george & dbid = 51uric acid comes from the breakdown of purines , not protein . purines are in dna / rna and are the result of the body breaking down cells . but there is a connection to protein – foods high in protein tend to be high in purines . i don ’ t understand why plant purines are less likel to cause gout flare ups but that ’ s what choi found : choi , h. k. , k. atkinson , e. w. karlson , w. willett , and g. curhan . “ purine-rich foods , dairy and protein intake , and the risk of gout in men . ” n engl j med . 2004 350 ( 11 ) : 1093-103.choi , h. k. , s. liu , and g. curhan . “ intake of purine-rich foods , protein , and dairy products and relationship to serum levels of uric acid : the third national health and nutrition examination survey . ” arthritis rheum .

( rr per 200 g / day . 98 ) has anyone on staff looked at this meta-analysis ? if so , could you provide some insight ? i have been reviewing this meta-analysis in more depth – and want to point out that while the study concluded that whole milk may be somewhat protective , it identified two fairly recent studies showing an association between prostate cancer and risk of progression to fatal disease . see http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc3542910 / thanks for these pointers . i don ’ t have access to the 32 cohorts study but will read the other one.i am horrified that i encouraged my three children ( 2 boys an 1 girl ) to drink milk when they were growing up ( as is the praxis in dairy-traditional sweden where i live ) thinking i was doing the right thing . all that dairy at home and school , thinking it was a good source of calcium , yet this country has the highest rate of osteoporosis in the world.have always bought organic food , even though it is very expensive here and i have very small means . think food is more important than clothes or anything else you spend money on , as it is an investment in your health . recently been learning about plant-based diets through my daughter ( 19 ) who is vegan and through this site . i make only vegan food when she visits and i like it too . i drink organic soy milk myself now instead of cows milk.in general i ’ ve always eaten very little meat ( and nearly always organic ) . always said i could easily be a vegetarian since i like all of those vegetarian foods . ( or at least a pescetarian ) ; i grew up right on a little fishing lake in michigan and like eating fish and love seafood . haven ’ t eaten meat in a long time now , but have eaten fish with my boys . i ’ m scared to death of chicken since i ’ ve learned more about it . have been avoiding cheese for a while , but find it ’ s really tempting , my oldest son ( 21 , lives on his own ) was influenced to purchase more fruit and vegetables by my daughter . he hasn ’ t changed the rest of his diet however . he is very physically active and trim but smokes unfortunately ( that cough of his really scares me ) . though cigarettes aren ’ t as bad as all the things he used to put in his body and brain , if you get my drift ( he ’ s been clean for over a year ) , so i can ’ t push too hard.the youngest is 15 ( who lives mostly with his father ) has some problems with weight gain due to medications and an extremely sedentary lifestyle because of agoraphobia and extrem social anxiety . been trying to get his father to at least use lower fat dairy products ( which my son eats no problem when he ’ s with me ) but my ex-husband doesn ’ t listen well to others , especially me , and he is not easily convinced of anything . my ex ’ s father has prostate cancer and his maternal grandfather died from it , so if there are any hereditary factors my boys might not be so lucky.i just hope the example my daughter is setting and my own attempts to change my eating habits will influence them in a positive direction . my ex has hypertension so i sent him an article about flax seeds and he seemed very interested , so there is some hopd.stacey , i think a lot of us understand both your frustration with the misdirection of health based education over the decades and also the current issues surrounding what you now know in relation to reluctant loved ones ! at least i do ! though nutrition will probably always be open to it ’ s areas of debate , so many of the facts get twisted by those with an agenda , and it just makes doing the right thing almost impossible for most people . i decided the best course ultimately , was to simplify to the extreme . it works on all levels for me because it is the cheapest route too ! no animals products , and nothing processed … plant products as they come from nature , or mildly processed , as in cooking , fermenting , or simple ways of preserving . if i make bread i even grind my own grain , often sprouted first . a bit more work but also so satisfying on a gut level ! ( ha ha , i made a punny ! ) keep taking the best care that you can of yourself … and whoever else you can , and hope that they get the message . i know this is no help , but you aren ’ t alone in it ! thanks for your encouragement ! i suggest try to find a local farmers market in your area. http : / / www.localharvest.org / just punch in the zip code and a list will show up , not only of farmers markets , but farms , meat suppliers etc . ( i am not sure if you live in u.s. or not – this site may be limited to u.s. ) sometimes , produce from farmers markets are more reasonably priced . i live on a very limited income , so i understand your frustration and i ’ ve noticed prices are sky-rocketing where i live . not a good sign . : ( i also suggest look to acquire some heirloom seeds . even if you don ’ t have land or a yard , produce can be grown in containers and also see if there is a community farm or co-ops in your area . these are merely suggestions , in the end you will make the decisions that work best for you and your family . : - ) yes , in time by taking steps yourself in your choices , will play an impact on other people in your life.thanks for your suggestions . i live in sweden . food prices are among the highest in europe . we have a value added tax ( a type of sales tax , included in the sticker price ) of 12 % on food and 25 % on everything else . also there is a near monopoly with the few grocery store chains . unfortunately many swedes have the attitude that you should spend the least amount of your money on food , perhaps because it ’ s so unreasonably expensive . of course , organic food is even more expensive . i recently bought organic cauliflower for about $ 5 a pound.there is at least another meta-analysis supporting the same conclusions ( just thought it would be interesting pointing out as it is more recent ) : http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 25527754 . it looks at dairy products in general but seems to look each product individually ( milk vs cheese , etc ) .hi , i would like a video about food for childeren ( 8-10 years old ) ; should they eat meat , dairy , raw milk etc to grow ? or what should they eat / supplement to max. there health . thanks.the only way for an optimum healthy life is to consume raw organic foods . all your veggies should be certified organic , your meat should be pastured grass fed , milk should be raw , nuts and seeds should be raw and uncooked . this is how humans lived for thousands of years and how mother nature intended it to be.you post very cogent , well researched statements – kudos . question : with something being certified ‘ organic ’ – is that a reasonable assurance , considering organic standards are not enforced ? i try to buy local when i can . i knew some local farmers that were selling their produce / meats / products at a local farmer ’ s market … the fda threatened to shut down their stands , since they used the term organic . the farmers were very ethical and proud of their organic products . it ’ s almost as if the fda owns the rights to the term organic . i suggested , to just label their products are pesticide free , hormone free , etc. instead . ; - ) when i first learned of the industrialized food system ( codex , fda laughable standards , meat industry , gmo contamination of farmland , acquisition of seed companies from monsanto and the like , etc ) it was disturbing . : o luckily , farmers are banding together , and defending food freedoms and independence . buy clean ( heirloom seeds ! i can ’ t stress that enough , for anyone that reads this … . ) .usda is the agency in control of organic certification ; fda considers ( at best ) proportions of organic ingredients in a processed , labeled product . the natl organic standards board decides details . whoever hassled the farmers , they were selling their crop as organic without being certified ; since the 1990s , that ’ s a federal no-no , and so far has stopped a lot of fraud and frustrated some presumably honest but often not-well-informed farmers . if you have faith in a local farmer ’ s honesty and knowledge , lack of certification is no obstacle . they just can ’ t use the word . some go biodynamic and are certified by demeter , whose rules differ a bit.ilse : dr. greger has several videos which discuss health issues regarding children . it is very important to note that none of videos support children eating any meat , dairy or eggs . there ’ s even one video where dr. greger quotes the famous pediatrician , dr. spock ( sp ? ) as saying that no dairy is appropriate for children after they are weaned.it is the position of the american dietetic association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets , including total vegetarian or vegan diets , are healthful , nutritionally adequate , and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases . well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle , including pregnancy , lactation , infancy , childhood , and adolescence , and for athletes . here are dr. greger ’ s general nutrition recommendations : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / but you have a fair point that children do have some special needs , and those are not specifically addressed by dr. greger ’ s materials . i think that the site vrg ( vegetarian resource group ) has some great , well-researched materials regarding how to feed children healthy food . check out these pages : http : / / www.vrg.org / nutshell / kids.php http : / / www.vrg.org / family / kidsindex.htmyou might also check out materials from the physician ’ s committee for responsible medicine ( pcrm ) , which is another wonderfully well-research source for information on healthy eating : http : / / www.pcrm.org / pdfs / health / info _ children.pdf http : / / www.pcrm.org / pdfs / health / info _ advchild.pdfhope that helps ! isn ’ t cow ’ s milk one of the harder milks for the majority of the population to digest ? also , since organic standards are not really enforced , could some of these issues be attributed to milk that is labelled organic , but in reality not ? organic gives the food companies a reason to jack up the price … .but it doesn ’ t mean they are truly organic . fda standards are abysmal.again , the rules are enforced – by nosb , founded by organic farmers as part of usda . for a good critique of organics in the us , see cornucopia ’ s ranking of nominally organic milks and eggs , and last november yogurts.i ’ d be curious to break it down even more : was the milk they used pasteurized / homogenized . what about raw milk ? our family gets raw cow ’ s milk and i am no longer drinking it because i believe it might be causing inflammation and my dh is also doing an experiment and quitting it for awhile , however , my kids still drink some , but i have cut way back for them.organic milk and raw milk are very different . organic milk , while labeled organic , can still contain pesticides and it is pasteurized ( heated to the point where vitamins and nutrition is destroyed ) and homogenized ( fat globules broken up ) . raw milk is not pasteurized or homogenized . raw milk retains all the natural fat and nutrition which actually help regulate the body and to lose weight . yes , natural fat can help lose weight . they might as well used factory farm milk in this study . such a shame to see deceiving studies taking place , misinforming the public . make sure to drink raw milk , not organic , because big corporations have tainted the “ organic ” name.all milk is formulated to stimulate growth , especially i would think raw milk . it is not just the hormones that are directly absorbed and remain active in the human body , but also the proteins themselves . animal studies with isolated casein protein , the primary protein in milk stimulated and promoted cancer growth to such a degree that 100 % of the rats who consumed it developed liver cancer . in contrast none of rats feed plant protein , either wheat gluten or soy protein , developed liver cancer . 100 : 0 ratio ! in humans cows milk has been shown to stimulate the production of igf-1 , which plays a central role in the progression of many types of cancer.the reason for this different reaction between plant and animal protein is the ratio of amino acids in the different proteins . animal foods have more sulfur containing amino acids than plant protein , especially milk protein . so it is the very protein in milk that signals the infant mammal to grow , grow , grow ! and the growth signal is controlled by the percentage of calories represented by protein . slow growing animals like humans have milk with only about 5 % of calories as protein while very fast growing like rats have milk with 50 % of calories from protein . cow milk runs about 20 % -23 % protein , and so provides a much stronger growth signaling than human milk . not surprising really since a 60 lb calf needs to get to be a 600 lb cow in less than a year.and all of this is only important to infants . adult of all mammal species including humans have no need for such growth signaling . when it is still given in adulthood it will still stimulate growth , but often not of the type desired . at the cosmetic level it stimulated the skin and can be the source of acne . at a more important level it stimulates the growth of cancer.mammalian milk raw or pasteurized , organic or not , is definitely a functional food we all need to stay away from as adults.well … . if you pour whiskey on prostate cancer cells in a culture , they will probably die . that does , unfortunately , not mean that drinking whiskey will kill a prostate cancer in a human body . estrogen in milk will probably not make it through the liver ( that ’ s why contraceptive hormones have to be modified to work when taken orally ) . more interesting in this context may be the increased exposure to dioxins and similar highly stable compounds of which some can mimick the effects of sex hormones . prostate cancer grows best when nurtured by testosterone , while estrogen may have the opposite effect.any sense of who funded the clemson university study ? [ in future , would it not seem relevant to include who the funder ( s ) were of each study ? ) i am not sure . you can find the study here , but in the actual blog dr. greger always gives us the links.i posted my question because neither the video nor what i can see at the study link provides information about funders of the clemson university study . so , i ’ m sorry to say , a response 3 months later which reads “ i am not sure ” is not helpful.gotcha ! well thanks for telling me . forgive the delay it ’ s just that we receive perhaps 300 + emails a day ! here is the answer to your question : “ funding for this study was provided by the cancer research fund donated to clemson university by mr. and mrs. james creel and by the healthcare genetics program , department of nursing , clemson university ” many , many , many sincere thanks ! it bolsters the study to know the funders are not the type likely to expect skew results.i would love to know if there has been any work done on other dairy sources ( eg butter , and cheese ) , or is it all milk-focused ? hi nnmlly . these links will send you to everything we have on butter and cheese . all dairy products have lactose , which contain galactose ( the sugar found in milk that may be harmful ) . yogurt may have a bit less galactose , but it is still there . milk seems to be the most destructive of the dairy foods , but yogurt and other dairy products like cheese ( although the research is mixed ) , have been associated with increased risk of insulin-like growth factor , which can boost other disease risks like cancer . another study shows higher intake of lactose ( equivalent of 3 glasses of milk per day ) may be associated with ovarian cancer risk . so yes , lots on milk , but still plenty of studies that lump dairy protein together showing a connection between lots of dairy products and cancer risk . for example , this study found high intake of dairy protein and calcium from dairy products and high serum concentration of igf-i were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer . perhaps it ’ s the amount that matters ? of course these are only observational studies , but they can help identify trends . hope that helps answer your question . take a look though some of this and let me know if you further questions.thanks for posting this , josephthank you so much for this reply.i live in a very dairy-focused country ( new zealand ) , but do not buy milk for my family on the basis of the available research ( i can ’ t quite kick my occasional haloumi habit though ) .my child is completely dairy-free due to an intolerance . people often lecture me about giving her a calcium deficiency – the diary campaign here is so strong , that many people think she should spend her childhood in hospital , unable to breathe , rather then forgo milk.i spent some time looking at the literature around calcium requirements and was rather shocked to discover that recommended intakes overlapped with levels known to cause heart problems in some demographics . my conclusion was that recommended intakes were likely higher than needed , and that a clean wholefood diet , heavy on vegetables and devoid of processed crap ( along with plenty of outdoors activity ) ought to suffice.regardless – this is a happier , healthier home for being milk-free . thank you for sharing your research.annaplant-based milks should be fortified with calcium . don ’ t forget the beans and greens ! huge amounts there , as well as sesame seeds , nuts , seeds , even dried fruits like figs , but yes make sure to get enough calcium for the kiddo ! sounds like you ’ re on the right track : ) yup – beans , greens , sesame seeds , nuts , seeds , figs all take a front row in her diet . it took a few years to get her to eat all these things voluntarily , but the perseverance was worth it – she happily munches through them as meals or snacks.she is four now , and she just made ( with a wee bit of chopping help ) the salad to go with our dinner , and it has all the above in it ! thanks for the reassurance ! i drink milk almond milk , cancer , dairy , eggs , estrogen , factory farming practices , farm animals , growth promoters , hormones , japan , meat , men 's health , metastases , milk , mortality , organic foods , organic milk , prostate cancer , prostate health , steroids - -
PLAIN-440	what 's the right dose of saffron ? 30 mg transposes into about how many stigmas per day ? eileenmcv / originally posted on saffron versus aricept the typical dose used in the studies of saffron versus alzheimer ’ s , versus pms , and versus depression was indeed 30mg . each flower yields 7mg dried saffron , and i think there are 3 stigmas per flower , so 30mg should be about 13 threads ( which is typicallty how it ’ s sold in the store ) . but even less may have a physiological effect ( see wake up and smell the saffron ) . there ’ s also research on saffron and infertility , cancer , obesity , and erectile dysfunction . i ’ ll be rolling out more videos evaluating the latest science on spices and so make sure you ’ re subscribed to my videos and stay tuned ! i was able to find additional info on the uses , side effects , interactions and warnings of saffron use on web md.what an interesting and potent spice , indeed ! so do you think it would be better to eat 13 threads of the saffron a day or take a 88.25 mg capsule ? the capsule seems like it would be easier and cheaper , and i have recently bought a bottle of capsules . but i have been considering dividing the powder in the capsule and taking only 1 / 3 of what is in it per day . any advice on that would be awesome ! also just for others who may consider taking saffron instead of prozac , this is my experience . i have been on and off prozac for 20 years . it helps my depression but i get “ blah ” and lazy with severe decrease in libido . and one of my side effects has been weight gain . it makes me want to just eat and eat and eat some more ! so my doctor then put me on wellbutrin xl to combat those side effects , which did work , but then i got migraines and terrible muscle pains , which i then had to take migraine medicine for and have trigger point injections for the neck and back pain . so i have been off the prozac again for about 3 months , but recently got back to low place where i was desperate . i came across dr. greger ’ s youtube video 2 days ago . i immediately went to the health food store and purchased saffron capsules ( still worried about the 88.25 mg dose being off from the 30 mg in the video ) . so far i have only taken them for 2 days and have not yet noticed an improvement in depression , but i hope to . what i did notice was no desire to overeat or cravings . and so far there is no decrease in libido . and i seemed to have a little more get up and move than normal . so i am hopeful.did you have any side effects of feeling nervous or anxious ? ? hi angie , do you care to share any follow up on your experience with saffron ? and are you following the greger / fuhrman / or ornish diets ) % -50 % to 100 % ? angie … it ’ s been about one month since you posted this comment . have you continued to take saffron ? what do you think ? the 30mg quoted in the akhondzadeh s. et al . ( 2010 ) paper is not just dried saffron . yes , they refer to 15mg per capsule , but in the preparation section of the article [ please email me ( hectoraceves1964 @ hotmail.com ) if you need an actual copy for educational purposes ] they indicate that this is an extract they are using ; but do not indicate the extract ratio . however , they used 120 grams of dried stigmas to obtain their total ( i guess ) extract . the study lasted 16 weeks ( 112 days ) . there were 23 patients in the control arm , taking 30mg / day . so each person took 3,360 mg in the study , leading to a total of 77.28 grams of extract used ( if my math is not wrong ! ) . so to obtain the same amount of active ingredients as in the study , one should take about 50mg of dried saffron per day . - - -
PLAIN-456	is multivitamin use really associated to an increased risk of breast cancer ? i ’ m bit disappointed with your presentation , and i ’ m wondering why you exactly choose this multi vitamin study to underpin your conclusion in this video . the swedish cohort was from 2010 and in april of this year a meta-analysis , which is scientifically stronger in terms of proof , concluded : “ multivitamin use is likely not associated with a significant increased or decreased risk of breast cancer , but these results highlight the need for more case-control studies or randomized controlled clinical trials to further examine this relationship . ” [ … ] louis / originally commented on multivitamin supplements and breast cancer thank you so much louis for taking the time to contribute ! it is such a relief to see that meta-analysis come out . this video was queued up from my volume 5 dvd , reviewing the peer-reviewed nutritional science published between spring 2010 to spring 2011 , and so i just missed it ( it wasn ’ t indexed by the national library of medicine until august 19 , 2011 ) . of course negative findings don ’ t automatically “ cancel ” out positive findings . as one of my research preceptors once quipped : “ if two people drill for oil in texas and one finds oil and the other does not , one can ’ t conclude that the question of whether or not there is oil in texas remains undetermined . ” similarly , the conclusion from the 2010 study profiled in the video is not necessarily invalidated : “ these results suggest that multivitamin use is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer . this observed association is of concern and merits further investigation . ” but it ’ s nice to know that if there is an effect it ’ s not one that has been replicated ! the critical question remains : should women take multivitamins or not ? that depends on the risks versus benefits like any other life decision . since both the risks and the benefits appear equivocal ( see for example the national institutes of health state-of-the-science conference statement on multivitamins , pdf here ) i agree with the cleveland clinic journal article i featured and would recommend women take the money they would have spent on the pills and instead buy some produce with more proven benefits ( see my breast cancer and diet post , for example ) . a similar recommendation can be made for men ( as a similar meta-analysis likewise thankfully casts doubt on the multivitamin link there as well ) . until we know more , i agree with the conclusion from the meta-analysis you cite : “ until further studies assist in clarifying the association between multivitamin use and increased or decreased risk of breast cancer , health-care professionals should open discussions with their patients regarding multivitamin use and risk of breast cancer . ” addendum : reported in today ’ s archives of internal medicine , a study from iowa women ’ s health study suggesting that multivitamin use may actually shorten women ’ s lives . to quote the editor : “ because commonly used vitamin and mineral supplements have no known benefit on mortality rate and have been shown to confer risk … .a better investment in health would be eating more fruits and vegetables … ” my personal philosophy ( developed not in a vacuum but informed by the overall “ whole ” of medical research i ’ ve read about in the last quarter century ) is pretty strongly in favor of what you suggest dr. greger – natural whole foods over human supplements ( or drugs , etc ) i rarely take anything other than b12 and vit d ( doctor prescribed ) for this reason , and prepare almost all my vegan meals from scratch . that having been said , there is a huge question that seems to be left unaddressed ( from what i can tell of the summaries here of both / all studies ) which stands out : mainstream vitamins with their large number of questionable ingredients ( fillers , coloring etc etc – i ’ m referring to all ingredients other than the vitamins themselves ; and even the vitamins may be a case of “ not all are created equal ” in quality ) versus vitamin pills that are not just vegan , but also have the least iffy ingredients . i ’ d like to see a study differentiate , or try to , between those two classes . then there is the issue of possible harmful effects of megadoses . combine those and ask this question : “ mainstream chemicalized vitamins with megadoses , versus , vitamins with saner doses and with the least iffy ingredients ( in fillers , coloring , etc ) and the most natural sources of the vitamins / minerals ” in a well desgined study , on ( yet another factor ) people who ’ ve used it long enough to be more likely a difference , say at least several years . i will not predict the latter will do as well or better than whole foods ( my guess is whole foods always win , except , when a medical condition specific to the person is such that focused / higher doses have more benefits than negative side effects ) but i wouldn ’ t be surprised if the latter type of vitamins / ingredients / doses do better than , or not as much harm as , the former type ( mainstream / lots of chemical additives / fillers / ingredients , some in megadoses , etc ) . have any researcher friends you could suggest this study to ? ; - ) if multivitamins and supplements aren ’ t regulated and may not even contain the labeled ingredients , how do we know which d3 and b12 vitamin to get ? i stay away from multivitamins but eat healthy , non processed foods , and take my favorite supplements , like amla , fenugreek . please do a video on adaptogens like aswagandha and maca , also my favorites that i recommend to my yoga students . you are my nutrition guru . keep it up ! - - -
PLAIN-467	isn 't regular cocoa powder healthier than alkali-processed " dutched " cocoa ? in a previous video , it was stated that “ regular ” cocoa powder was healthier than the processed “ dutched ” cocoa powder , but this recipe states dutched . i prefer the unprocessed which i believe to be healthier . yummy / originally asked on healthy chocolate milkshakes you are absolutely right that alkali-processed “ dutched ” cocoa is not as healthy ( see update on chocolate for the graph and healthiest chocolate fix for some other chocolate comparisons ) . dutched cocoa can have as few as half the phytonutrients , but that just means you have to use twice as much ! making things even more chocolatey has never been a problem for me , and i just like the taste so much better that my household uses dutch ( like for our healthy chocolate ice cream recipe ) , but if the taste of regular cocoa works for you , then go for it – you ’ re getting even more benefit per spoonful ! ok , but why don ’ t go a step further ? what about a post / video about roasted against raw cocoa ? thanks ! ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa is not processed and tastes great.is alkali the same as aniline ? if you are allergic to an aniline can you be allergic to alkali ? alkali isn ’ t a thing ; it ’ s a process . they expose the chocolate to a base ( in the chemistry sense ) , which changes the flavor and nutrient composition.mmm … … enjoying some dutched cocoa as i have with so many of your recommendations . i don ’ t think many people really realize the benefits – though you gave us great insights from the indians . may be time to revisit the subject . thankshershey ’ s special dark cocoa is a blend of natural and dutched ( alkalinized ) cocoa . natural is listed first on the ingredients . it is also delicious . i do like that hershey is very straightforward on the label – they say “ dutch processed cocoas are typically lower in antioxidant content than natural cocoa , and as a result hersheys special dark cocoa provides few antioxidants than hershy ’ s natural unsweetened cocoa ” . - - -

PLAIN-519	allergies a plant-based diet ( see also here ) may reduce the risk of allergies . in india , those eating the most fruit and vegetables , rather than supplements ( though probiotics and prebiotics have a positive effect on the common cold ) , were much less likely to report asthma or other allergies . the consumption of red rice , green tea , and especially white button mushrooms may help protect against atopic ( allergic ) diseases.components in meat that may trigger allergic reactions include antibiotics and parasitic fish worms . seafood and meat consumption were associated with higher prevalence of asthma , pollen allergies , and eczema . there are certain meat allergies that may be triggered by the lone star tick . dairy has been linked to the recurrence of canker sores , and cow ’ s milk is a leading allergen.though monosodium glutamate does not appear to trigger traditional allergic reactions ( update here ) , certain artificial colorings might due to the presence of cochineal , a red coloring derived from insects . common household chemicals may also cause allergy-related diseases.there is no evidence that allergies to peanuts are triggered in the fetus by pregnant women consuming peanuts , but 1 % of people do report nut allergies . - cardiovascular health , heart disease , fruit , cardiovascular disease , cancer , inflammation , heart health , vegetables , bagels , autoimmune diseases , dairy , bread , asthma , wheat , grains - -

PLAIN-55	foods for macular degeneration anyone who has gotten a bad sunburn knows how damaging the uv rays in sunlight can be . imagine what those same rays are doing to back of our eyeballs ( our retinas ) . the eye is designed to take sunlight and focus it like a magnifying glass into the back of our eyes . thankfully , we have a layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium that supports and protects our delicate retinal eyesight machinery . the layer builds up yellow plant pigments like zeaxanthin from our diet , absorbing blue light and protecting the retina from photo-oxidative damage . the yellowing of our corneas when we develop cataracts may actually be our bodies ’ defense mechanism to protect our retinas . in fact , when cataracts are removed , the risk of blindness from macular generation shoots up ( because we removed the protection ) . instead of trading one type of vision loss for another , it ’ s better to pigment the back of our eyes through diet instead of pigmenting the front of our eyes with cataracts . the pigment in the back of our eyes is entirely of dietary origin , “ suggesting that the most common cause of blind registration in the western world could be delayed , or even averted , with appropriate dietary modification , ” according to authors of a study on age-related macular degeneration . where in our diet do we get these pigments ? the egg industry brags that eggs are a good source , but have nearly six high-lutein , free-range , certified organic eggs a week for three months and the pigmentation in one ’ s eyes may only marginally increase ( see egg industry blind spot ) . instead of getting the phytonutrients from the egg that came from the chicken that came from the corn and blades of grass the chicken pecked on , we could get it from the source . one cup of corn and a half cup of spinach a day for three months seems to dramatically boost the protective eye pigment in subjects . in the video , dietary prevention of age related macular degeneration , you can see a comparison of the amount of these phytonutrients from eggs compared to corn and spinach . if we cut out the middlehen and get these nutrients from plants directly , we see a substantially larger increase in protective eye pigment . three months after the subjects stopped eating the corn and spinach , the levels of these pigments remained relatively high , indicating that once we build our macular pigment up with a healthy diet , our eyeballs really try to hold on to it . so even if we go on vacation and end up eating more iceberg lettuce than spinach , our eyes will hold out until we get back . eggs can increase zeaxanthin levels in the blood , but they can also raise bad cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease . thus , as researchers conclude , “ an egg yolk-based dietary strategy to increase plasma zeaxanthin cannot be recommended , and an alternative , cholesterol-free , food source is desirable . ” one such alternative would be goji berries , which have up to 60 times more zeaxanthin than eggs . a modest dose of goji markedly increases levels in our body . consumption of goji berries may be an effective , safe whole food strategy to increase zeaxanthin in the bloodstream . but we don ’ t need it in our blood , we need it in our eyes . a group of researchers performed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to test the effectiveness of goji berries at increasing pigment levels . to preserve eyesight in the elderly in traditional chinese medicine , people are often prescribed 40 to 100 goji berries a day . in this study , participants consumed only about 15 berries a day for three months . even at this small dose researchers found that goji berries could protect against loss of pigment and prevent the buildup of debris that builds up in the back of the eye . both loss of pigment and debris buildup are associated with age-related macular degeneration . macular degeneration is the leading cause of legal blindness in older men and women , affecting more than ten million americans , so increasing our consumption of these pigments as a society could significantly decrease the prevalence of blindness . in the above study , researchers gave the goji berries in milk so the butterfat could increase the absorption of these carotenoid pigments . a healthier way to get the same effect would just be to eat goji berries with nuts or seeds — in other words , goji trail mix . though they didn ’ t appear to boost a measure of immune function ( boosting natural killer cell activity ) , goji berries are one of the most antioxidant packed snacks out there . a tip on getting them inexpensively can be found in my video are goji berries good for you ? goji berries are from the nightshade family and can cause intense pain-issues and neurological ailments in certain individuals whose bodies ’ can not effectively deal with the alkaloids in nightshades . a nightshade-free diet eliminated most of my joint pain and arthritic and neurological issues.since you , dr. greger , found out how much much better indian gooseberries are , couldn ’ t one substitute org . amla powder for the goji berries ( i did use a teaspoon per person in my morning smoothie ) ? obviously i can ’ t speak for dr. greger , but one interpretation is that if you want good anti-oxident protection you add amla whereas if you want corneal pigments you use goji berries.i wouldn ’ t be surprised if half a teaspoon of each wasn ’ t better for you than a teaspoon of either.thank you , jeff ! i am glad you showed me the need for both for different ways to help our vision ! where do you find goji berries ? i see them covered in dark chocolate but not by themselves.perhaps this link would be of use. http : / / www.amazon.com / healthworks-certified-organic-goji-berries / dp / b00bpx4ops / ref = sr _ 1 _ 2 ? ie = utf8 & qid = 1420159200 & sr = 8-2 & keywords = goji + berries thank you.znaturalfoods.comon a goji bush … do you know how to get down off an elephant ? sorry , i got tullamore dew for christmas.goji berries covered in dark chocolate are probably healthy as long as you aren ’ t particularly sugar sensitive and you avoid other sugar sources . they would probably be significantly less healthy for the pocketbook , though.it is the lens ( not the cornea ) that yellows from uv and develops cataracts.both lens and cornea are subject to clouding up.ha ! ! “ middlehen ” … article is informative and funnythere seems to be an error in describing the goji berry dosing used in the cited studies . here and in videos , dr. greger says the the studies used 15 berries / day . however , as i read the studies cited the doses used were 13.7 grams / day in one and 15 grams / day in the other . i ’ ve counted out and weighted goji berries and found that it took roughly 80 berries to make up even 14 grams . that is nearly 2 tablespoons , and would be more in line with the traditional chinese medicine dosing ( 40-100 berries ) that dr. greger mentions.please check , clarify , and correct if needed.i have early macular degeneration and have been using goji berries at the 15 berries / day dosing since dr. greger ’ s videos on the subject ; but i guess i had not checked the dosing against the cited studies until today.i would be happier at the low dose , because medline says goji berries exert “ moderate ” interactions with medications , including suppression of the liver ’ s p450 cytochrome detoxification system – which might cause an unwanted increase in blood levels of one of my antiviral meds.http : / / www.nlm.nih.gov / medlineplus / druginfo / natural / 1025.htmlthere have been case reports of serious interactions with warfarin.these potential drug interactions might be worth noting.i would much prefer to be told i ’ m missing something , or otherwise mistaken about the study dosing.thanks to dr. greger for all your work , and a happy new year to all ! i sympathize with you because i know someone who struggles with this problem too . it takes a lot of toughness to cope with md . what if you back off the berries and compensate with some spinach ? i if you don ’ t like spinach ( like me ) , you might try mixing in with swiss chard , arugula and kale . for some reason i love the blended flavours of green leafies. the more the merrier ! best wishes to you . keep up the fight ! thanks . i ’ m lucky to like spinach , with or w / o other green leafies . actually , my habit lately has been to have spinach daily , in a mid-morning smoothie that includes goji berries . ( but how many ? ? ? ) i ’ m also lucky to have no symptoms so far from my macular degeneration – that ’ s what i meant by “ early ” ( at 63 it ’ s not early onset ) .it amazes me how spinach and asparagus can be so disgusting cooked to dark green and sloppy ( with or without mayonnaise ) and yet so delicious raw ( spinach ) or lighly sauteed ( asparagus ) topped with a little vinaigrette.arugula and kale have their own benefits . ( oops … i thought md meant muscular distrophy . i was wondering if you were a mind-reader . ) i grew up with cooked spinach ( with cream ) and i like raw spinach as a smoothie with an orange or a pear . but lately i must have had too much smoothie as my breakfast because i have been told by an older sweet md ( gone to be with the lord already at age 96 ) before when the output still has almost the same color as the input then it did not get digested well enough . and he used to give me a product called zypan ( = pancreatic enzymes + … ) and that helped me in the past ( to be taken with a meal that is not hotter than lukewarm ) , but i did not like that he thought i would have to keep taking this with meals ( that my digestion would not improve ) . he said that older people do not have enough stomach acid for digestion ? any thoughts on this ? and does the spinach and the corn have to be raw to be of benefit ? thank you for any and all input ! hmmm . i typed “ what causes macular degeneration ” and searched with duckduckgo.com ( it doesnt track you ) , and all the hits say it is caused by getting old and genetics : “ although early onset cases are becoming more common in patients as young as 40 ″ . pretzel logic . round up the usual suspects . you ’ re all helpless victims.shouldn ’ t someone write the retina-international folks a letter ? with letters after their name ? thanks , coacervate , for “ duckduckgo.com ” ! bilberries were used in wwii for pilots to protect their eyesight . it is likely blueberries also support eye health . while the dark anthocyanins characterize dark berries , often the lighter pigments occur as well , and there are other health advantages to blues . in addition , they are not in the nightshade family . blues are widely available , sourced in the u.s.i am extraordinarily fond of this story . it is widely reported and re-reported , and is occasionally debunked as a myth . when sir winston churchill ordered an attack on a german dam , he ordered a very precise night strike that would be very hard on the eyes even during the day using bouncing bombs to avoid torpedo nets . i believe these pilots were told to improve their night vision and i believe they used carrots . it is said by some that the raf pilots were told to say that they were eating bilberry jam to confuse the german spies that were present into thinking that would cause night vision improvement . i feel this story today shows that purple pumpkins or purple carrots , possibly their original color , would actually be better for the eyesight than they are now . those are the foods that are known to improve eyesight . it is actually not really known if bilberries are good for eyesight , but they would be good for anyone who eats them ! goji berries can improve vision , reported here.wait ! you mean pumkins used to be purple ? ? ? i feel so cheated ! bilberries were used in wwii for pilots to protect their eyesight . it is likely blueberries also support eye health . while the dark anthocyanins characterize dark berries , often the lighter pigments occur as well , and there are other health advantages to blues . in addition , they are not in the nightshade family . blues are widely available , sourced in the u.s.please , can you tell me what “ legal ” blindness means ? brite , legal blindness is defined in america as 20 / 200 as best possible corrected vision in either eye . unaided vision is not defined in blindness . according to optometrists , 20 / 20 is average vision for america for all ages . what is the standard deviation of eyesight ? eyesight can worsen throughout life . only more than 3.6 million americans over 40 have vision less than 20 / 40 according to optometrists. http : / / www.aao.org / newsroom / upload / eye-health-statistics-april-2011.pdf i am surprised at how good american vision is , very few people have less than perfect vision according to optometrists.thanks a lot , matthew , for your veryy clear and complete answer.i think that the contradiction leans in the possibility of a correction ( it is said “ even with eyeglasses ) .thank you ! perhaps eye wear is worn mostly to correct astigmatism . or , as you say , perhaps only 3.6 million americans have eyesight that cannot be corrected to 20 / 20 . please excuse the typo i corrected . “ were ” to “ wear . ” i think it is very challenging for the brain to see and hear at the same time , and uses brain waves to achieve that goal , the alpha to see , the delta to hear . even on a pot of matcha tea a day i still cannot see 20 / 20 with my alpha brain wave being very over active . did you know all optics , including the human eye , produce an image that is upside down and mirrored ? the central optic nerve in your brain has to reverse and invert this . the delta brain wave might help generate depth perception . nuts and seeds can cause the delta brain wave , and maybe so can elder flower tea . it is very challenging to produce the cones that it takes to hear in three dimensions with a flat ear , it is challenging to locate a sound . i think the delta brain wave works with the alpha brain wave to achieve this , location in hearing . this is a very difficult task that can cause pain or disease if it becomes disoriented . i have often wondered why people with brain damage still do not have problems of perception in seeing or location in hearing . perhaps these brain waves are deep inside of us . perhaps they use the whole of the nervous system . thank you for your help . ” the alpha to see , the delta to hear . ” i think it ’ s a lot more likely that delta is needed to both see and hear and alpha is needed to coordinate and report results . i would bet that delta brain waves occur during pattern recognition on non-myelinated , heavily circular neurons and alpha brain waves occur on myelinated neurons that stretch relatively straight between brain regions . i am sure a neurologist could probably come along and find a couple errors in my understanding , though . “ the central optic nerve in your brain has to reverse and invert this . ” i think the central optic nerve reports to the processing center in the back of the brain * as mapped * and the inversion happens somewhere after that . i am not really even sure that “ upside down ” is a well-defined concept . think of sensory perception as a topological phenomenon – you can stretch and turn without changing things , but “ between ” is meaningful ( although with a different meaning at the nerve source than at the brain center target ) and the primary conserved property is consistency of destination . the same point on your body will always send impulses to the same processing column in your brain regardless of what other factors change . distance between areas on your body ( i am talking about touch instead of vision now – hopefully the metaphor holds ) are determined experimentally by your brain based on a signal pattern running across your body in pulses whose timing trigger the mapping on the brain structures.also if you have less than 20 degrees of vision you are termed “ legally blind ” . so a person could see 20 / 20 but still be legally blind if their vision field is less than 20 degrees . most people have 140 degrees of vision.when cataracts are removed , the implants that replace the human lens almost all have uv blocker incorporated into the material , so the risk of macular degeneration after cataract extraction doesn ’ t necessarily increase.i add about 1 teaspoon of goji beeries to a smoothie about once per week , is that sufficient ? i ’ ve been reading a lot about the hazards of blue light coming from computer monitors ( lcd screens ) and full spectrum light bulbs . it seems to be more dangerous for people who have had cataracts removed . best to wear the yellow tinted blue light filter glasses while working on computers.i see that there are supplements for zeaxanthin. is that helpful for masular degenerationi am sick and tired of reading about high cholesterol allegedly causing heart problems . this is the medicine of the end of the 20th century ! ! good cardiologists like dr sinatra , who also thought of cholesterol as the culprit , his practice made him change his mind back in the 1990s . and there are scores of others . people who have suffered a heart attack , their cholesterol level was high only in 50 % , which means it is not a scientific argument.dr greger in order to bias his vegetarian / vegan views serves us with his theories about eggs causing high cholesterol.dr lair ribeiro , a brazilian eminent cardiologist and nutriologist considers eggs as the most important food after maternal milk . he cannot start a day without eating 3-4 eggs . there are scores of videos on youtube . but unfortunately even first class physicians like dr greger will never understand it without getting rid of their prejudice . such physician should read / see cardiologists like dr sinatra , who laughs his head off when he hears about cholesterol causing heart problems.i wish i had higher cholesterol . ( i have it only slightly above 200 . i eat around 10-12 eggs per week and i cannot reach 250 cholesterol levels . i am probably not human even though i lead a sedentary life . this is the evidence , dr greger . i also love vegetables and fruits and .. fish and meat as well . the last two may sound to you like a red rag to a bull . sorry about that . this is called meditarreanean diet . have you heard of that ? i am not talking about the studies done in the 1950s or 60s , but a recent publication from 2012 . dr greger , if you have an open mind , you should present this study here in your posts instead of cherry picking limiting your mind to only plants . plants are great ! but only plants is the same as relying only on mainstream media and showing big-headedness.richardorichard : re : “ people who have suffered a heart attack , their cholesterol level was high only in 50 % , which means … ” your conclusion is not logical based on the evidence . what your statistic really means is that the labeling of “ high ” by traditional medicine is grossly incorrect . or perhaps an even better way of looking at it is : “ high ” is not a helpful category when an entire population is on average too high . instead , what we want is “ safe ” levels of cholesterol.so , what we know is that a total cholesterol below 150 and ldl below 70 makes one pretty much heart-attack-proof . but above 150 , a person is in the danger zone . this explains your 50 % statistic . those are people who traditional medicine does not label as high , but in fact who are “ high ” if by “ high ” one really means “ a level that will lead to hard attacks ” .i understand why you think that cholesterol is not relevant . there is a lot of misinformation out there that has convinced people such as yourself that cholesterol does not matter . it sounds like you care deeply about evidence and as you say , cherry picking is not good . if you want to know how the cholesterol denyiers cherry pick and outright twist their evidence , i highly recommend the scholarly work from plant positive . plant positive directly addresses the issues / claims you have been exposed to.http : / / plantpositive.com / thea , thank you for your reply.please tell me why the french have on average 250 cholesterol level ? and it is one of the last nations in western europe who suffer from , cvd . and what is their staple diet ? unfortunately they have problems with cirrhosis … but it is a different story.yes , i was imprecise about high cholesterol . sorry . you have scored a point . but our body needs cholesterol badly ! look , the cholesterol deposits in the arteries is the body ’ s reaction to help patch up the scars in the arteries due to the mechanical damage ( huge pressure ) chemical damage resulting from scores of other factors – lack of nutrients , toxification , etc.the worst is inflamation , blood inflamation in this case . if it weren ’ t for the helping hand of the cholesterol we would die from internal bleeding , ! ! ! thank god we have cholesterol ! besides , cholesterol is needed to synthetize vitamin d , whose importance even dr greger talks about . we need it for our hormone production – testosterone , estrogen . every cell needs our cholesterol , and last but not least our brain.do you want to starve your body ? – if so , it is your choice . but before you do it , just open your mind , read at least dr sinatra or just see this http : / / www.heartmdinstitute.com / health-topics / cholesterol / 579-what-s-really-good-and-bad-about-cholesterol . these are only snatches . go deeper . if you want more , i can give you other links.there are scores of cardiologists who follow the same idea . neither of those “ pro-cholesterol doctors want us to eat a meat meal 5 times a week , if you have it once or twice a week , you won ’ t suffer from cholesterol deficiency . that brazilian doctor i mentioned last time is around 70 years old and he looks at most 55 . that “ eggs-eater ” should have been dead long ago if cholesterol were not a myth . i should have been dead as well.i know it is hard to shake or uinlearn our way of thinking and change it when the evidence is in front of us.sorry , i have to leave you – two soft-boilt eggs are waiting for me.ricardo , you are unfortunately employing the “ cholesterol is necessary ” argument , a common argument used to support cholesterol rich diets . “ given the capability of all tissues to synthesize sufficient amounts of cholesterol for their metabolic and structural needs , there is no evidence for a biological requirement for dietary cholesterol . therefore , neither an adequate intake nor a recommended dietary allowance is set for cholesterol.there is much evidence to indicate a positive linear trend between cholesterol intake and low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration , and therefore increased risk of coronary heart disease ( chd ) . a tolerable upper intake level is not set for cholesterol because any incremental increase in cholesterol intake increases chd risk . ” http : / / www.nap.edu / openbook.php ? record _ id = 10490 & page = 542there is no dietary need to consume cholesterol . if inflammation is what your worried about , diets rich in saturated fat and cholesterol are by far the most inflammatory of all . those 2 hardboiled eggs your eating , as performed in this study , resulted in endothelium impairment after consuming . a clear sign of inflammation. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pmc / articles / pmc2904713 / # ! po = 43.1818you can see other mechanisms of inflammation here. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / ?

what difference does it make if these individuals agree with the science or not . dr. mercola himself is a well known quack and i would hardly consider him a reliable source of information.to say that cholesterol is unrelated to heart disease is to turn a blind eye to the countless studies showing this link and cherry pick a meager few . this is indeed the theme of the video we are commenting on . please look at the evidence coherently . i have seen both sides of this argument and know the arguments people use to support a cholesterol rich diet . i hope you will take the time to truly understand what you are getting yourself into and see the other side of it . here is a good place to clear up the cholesterol confusion. http : / / plantpositive.com / 18-cholesterol-confusion-1-pri / lastly , ” hate hard-boilt eggs . where did you take it from ? were you dreaming ? read more closely , please . ” came from your comment . “ sorry , i have to leave you – two soft-boilt eggs are waiting for me . ” i ’ m sorry , i should have said soft boiled egg instead of hard . i didn ’ t know there was a difference.toxins , let ’ s take the argument from a different angle . do names like gregg braden , deepak chopra or rupert sheldrake to name just a few ring a bell in your mind ? especially the last one.there are two aspects , both are based on science – experiments in vitro and experiments in vivo . dr sinatra is a good example of the latter and in point of fact this is what matters – his 35 years of clinical practice.you see , i have lost faith in the so-called science of the 18th century , which we still practise today , even though i myself have a phd ( not in the field ) . the paradigm of what is science and what the science is not , is in the process of a change.if you are a good observer , you must have noticed that there has been a huge uproar against the old-fashioned science and it is still on the increase . the reasons are obvious . delve into sheldrake ’ s science set free ( american title ) or just watch scores of videos showing how “ science ” tried to enslave him . his life is a good example . this one is good stuff http : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = upccmlgug8a science has turned out to become a religious belief . no wonder there are so many alternative approaches in almost every field , because people are fed up with those egg-headed 18th century individuals who live today . the pure example is richard dawkins . those “ scientists ” have led themselves to the dead-end street . and they are blocking any development.but our discussion has become something else.returning to the cholesterol issue , there ’ s hardly a difference if you argue one way or another . for me you are like dr greger limiting himself to showing views that only support a vegetarian or vegan diet . why doesn ’ t he comment on the recent spanish study on meditarranean diet ? why doesn ’ t he want to face the reality ? it is not very comfy , is it ? obviously , it isn ’ t , because his vegetarian diet will have to be scrapped.i have always tried to see both sides of the argument . it gives me pleasure to read nutritionfacts but i don ’ t wear blinkers , or blinders as you say in america . i remember my being afraid of cholesterol in the 1970s , which did not make me vegetarian . i am omnivore because a human being has always been like that . and i am too old to go into fads.ricardorichard : sorry it took me so long to get back to you.re : “ but our body needs cholesterol badly ! ” that ’ s always such an interesting argument to me , because no one i know disputes that our bodies need some amount of cholesterol to function correctly . i would say that it is a strawman argument , except that i think that when people say that , they are really thinking something else and just not being specific.if what you are really suggesting is that our bodies need cholesterol and that the only way to get it is by eating it or that we have to supplement what our bodies make by eating it , then toxins already answered that point . our bodies make all of the cholesterol that we need . no worries there.if you are suggesting that our bodies need cholesterol and therefore there is no way to have too much of it , then i would point out an analogy for you : our bodies also need water . but too much of it can kill you . to think that our bodies can have unlimited amounts of cholesterol without there ever being a problem ( that cholesterol is more special than water ) is against all common sense . i ’ m not saying you believe this . i ’ m just making a point.so , there is a limit / line above which too much of the stuff in our veins would be a problem . the question is : where is that line ? we know that when total cholesterol is below 150 and ldl below 70 , people don ’ t get heart attacks . above that , people get heart attacks . unsafe cholesterol ( ie , above 150 ) is not a guarantee that a person will get a heart attack , but the risk goes way up compared to having safe cholesterol levels.this gets us back to our original points : you stated that 50 % of the people who get heart attacks have low ( or normal ? ) cholesterol . and i explained how the traditional definition of “ low ” is has been perverted in a society where “ normal ” is too high to be safe . ie , where normal is to die of heart disease.hope that explanation clarifies my point.sure , it does . but see a human body holistically . you don ’ t want more cholesterol than 150 because from your point of view it is dangerous for heart attack . and what about your brain , and the production of vitamin d , and other hormones ? if you are happy , lower your cholesterol below 100 , it is your choice . perhaps you will never have a heart attack and that ’ s great but what about your brain and other hormones and probably sth else that we have not discovered yet ? ricardorichard : the thing is , the healthiest people on the planet , the ones who have sharp minds at 100 + and live long healthy lives , generally have cholesterol below 150 and primarily eat a whole foods plant based diet . ( you can do research on the “ blue zone ” populations if you want . ) so the specific problems , plus general worries you list ( ie : “ … and probably sth else that we have not discovered yet ? ” ) are not an issue in practice.in theory , your concern could be a valid one : if someone can have cholesterol that is too high , can we also have cholesterol that is too low ? zero cholesterol is too low . but where is the line ? i ’ m not aware of anyone , baring some genetic deficiency , whose body isn ’ t able to make * * * all of the cholesterol that they need . * * * and that ’ s the point . if you have all that you need , then you have all that you need . ie , not just low enough to avoid heart disease , but high enough to be healthy . the entire point of nutritionfacts.org is to figure out the diet that is most likely to lead to optimum health / disease prevention . baring some terrible problem where a person ’ s body doesn ’ t make all of the cholesterol that they need , we don ’ t have to worry about cholesterol going too low . our bodies make what we need . once that idea really sinks in , the concerns you raise disappear . here is some evidence to back up this point ( click “ sources cited ” for details if interested ) : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / can-cholesterol-be-too-low / thea , you see , i am very “ allergic ” to people who are “ mono ” . i mean , who ar4e specialists in only the right toe of the left foot or who love only one type of music or who talk only about one subject and those who are vegetarian or only meat-eaters or only fish-eaters , or only speak one language , etc etc.a human being must try to develop their full potentiality and nobody will convince me that eating only meat is the best or eating only vegetables is the best and they usually try to support their arguments from their own yard . try to see why being a vegetarian is wrong . there is plenty of material ( not only in english ) instead of convincing yourself of your being right using arguments taken from your like-minded people.i have forgotten before to add that my example of eating eggs is not the only one . there are far more omnivore people than vegetarians or vegans , although it is not a scientific argument to prove you wrong . besides i am far away to convince anybody.for vegetarians cholesterol was a red rag to a bull and therefore they turned vegetarian ( others did it for other reasons , for instance animal-lovers ) , but the whole problem with cholesterol is a hoax.your argument that the body produces sufficient cholesterol is taken from the air . the same we may say that the body produces enough vitamin c ( it does not produce any ) or that it produces enough coq10 or enough hormones.as we know nothing is static and with age there are changes in the level of hormones , etc , etc . so why are you sure that our bodies produce sufficient amount of cholesterol in this case ? perhaps it doesn ’ t.last but not least i think our life is too short so that we should try ( at least this is my philosophy of life ) and find plenitude in every aspect of our lives to enrich our experience in order to live fully . why should i limit myself to eating only plants ? is it healthy . you say so and your sympathizers , because there is no strong scientific argument that this is true . there is no agreement among doctors and researchers on the issue . fortunately there is still food for us on our planet . we must use it sparingly but taking advantage of everything.how can i “ go into nothingness ” without drinking different kinds of alcohol , without experiencing hunger or unhappiness ? without experiencing love and happiness ? without eating meat , poultry , fish and eggs , vegetables and fruits ? cholesterol can be as low as the 10 range and you will still live a perfectly healthy life . this is evident in those who have genetic disorders resulting in extremely low cholesterol , thus , the argument that below 150 is too low is simply untrue . i would see this video for the evidence.http : / / plantpositive.com / 22-cholesterol-confusion-5-cho / great , toxins. my advice is you should strive to lower your cholesterol below 10 and you will lead perfectly healthy life . be happy.my point being the “ cholesterol is necessary ” argument for eating cholesterol is faulty on many levels . i would encourage you to watch the plant positive video i linked if you are truly interested in the evidence.as in my comparison somewhere here , motor vehicles are necessary , but scrap them leaving only 100 in the entire us and so many lives will be spared every year.good luck to you , ricardo.the same to you , toxins.ricardorichard : re : “ please tell me why the french have on average 250 cholesterol level ? ” i don ’ t know what the average french cholesterol level is , but i ’ m willing to accept your number for the moment for the sake of argument . i am aware that the french ( as least historically and maybe still today ) have lower cvd than say americans . so , let ’ s say this is the “ french paradox ” : ie , that their cholesterol levels are pretty darn high , but that they have relatively low rates of cvd . so , i think you are asking : how do we explain this apparent “ paradox ” ? for this , i would refer you to the “ asian paradox ” : on one hand , we have a bazillion and one studies showing that smoking causes or greatly increases our risk of cancer . on the other hand , we have some asian countries who smoke way more than america does , and yet has way less lung cancer . how do we explain that ? does that mean that smoking doesn ’ t really cause cancer ? no , smoking really is bad for us . smoking really does greatly increase our risk of getting cancer . what the data means , is that there is another factor at play in the asian countries . as we have seen on nutritionfacts , we are starting to learn what that confounding factor is – by eating a mostly whole food plant based diet , people can do a lot to lower their risk of various cancers , even when they smoke . we do not know the answer to the paradox for sure , but we definitely have enough information about smoking to know that smoking is indeed bad for us , regardless of what happens in some asian countries.the french paradox is likely the same situation , with a third factor mitigating their risk . why would i believe that the french paradox is anything like the asian paradox ? because like the issue of smoking , we have a bazillion and one studies showing that high cholesterol is a big risk factor for heart disease.something to think about.you try hard enough to always slant your explanation to a plant based diet . now i have caught you or rather you have led yourself to the dead-end street . whereas you were lucky to explain the asian paradox with the plant based diet , you are not so lucky to account for the french paradox by using the same method . this time you did not dare to use the same argument … because it was too risky.frankly speaking are you really convinced that a plant based diet slows down or reduces substantially harmful effects of smoking ? if so nutritionfact.org should take worries off the minds of the smokers in the western world as long as they follow a healthy ( in your understanding ) diet . logically thinking it is good idea , isn ’ t it ? as far as i am concerned i think that there are other factors ( not necessarily a plant-based die ) t that will account for that asian paradox . but one thing is certain – in case of the french as it was not convenient for you , you prefered to abstain from mentioning resveratrol , a phytonutrient found in red wine that is the “ culprit ” . obviously you couldn ’ t mention it , because wine is terribly destructive or even poison according to your way of thinking.ricardorichard : there is no great problem here . i didn ’ t speculate because i have no evidence on the confounding factors behind the french paradox . very simple . i stick to the evidence as best i can . i ’ m sorry you don ’ t understand the point i was making.thea , i did understand , i am afraid . do you call evidence , your explanation of the asian paradox ? we may call it only a hypothesis not the evidence . you couldn ’ t find that evidence in case of the french , because you can ’ t account for it using vegetarianism or veganism.ricardorichard : to clarify : 1 ) no i did not attempt to explain the asian paradox with strong evidence . what i said is that we are * starting * to understand the why ( with some good evidence ) . what i didn ’ t say explicitly , but will now is : the “ why ” is irrelevant . i didn ’ t have to mention the potential “ why ” , except that it is so interesting . the main * point * was : “ what the data means , is that there is another factor at play in the asian countries . ” that ’ s the point . even if we don ’ t know the details , we do know that smoking is bad for us . do you really want to argue this point ? 2 ) re : “ you couldn ’ t find … ” again , you mistake my meaning . i haven ’ t even looked for evidence regarding the case of the french paradox . i just don ’ t care . because what we know is that there * are * one or more confounding factors regarding the french for the reasons i explained above . in other words , just because the french may have higher cholesterol and lower heart attacks does not mean that the french situation wipes out all of the extremely strong science we have linking high cholesterol to heart disease . just like the existence of cancer free , smoking asians do not wipe out all of the very strong evidence that we have linking smoking to cancer . * that ’ s * the point . that is the answer to what i had believed was an honest question about the french.ad 1 no , i don ’ t think that smoking is a good and healthy thing . i simply tried to show you how funny your argumentation was.ad 2 you didn ’ t even try to look for the evidence because it would sound really funny to use the same kind of arguments . it looks that you cannot see the world around outside the vegetarian / vegan diet , which is a “ mono ” attitude ( i explained that before ) . the world is wider than healthy nutrition.cholesterol accumulating in the arteries is a consequence of the inflammation – without cholesterol the the sore spot of the damaged endothelium cannot be properly covered and protected . total cholesterol is meaningless . there could have some meaningful indications of the problem if you use a spectracell test , because the so-called ldl is not a devil as it is painted.one should devide ldl into small and dense particles . – the latter are really dangerous because they are highly inflammatory . please read more if you can take the information outside your health encyclopedia. http : / / www.heartmdinstitute.com / health-topics / cholesterol / 399-worried-about-cholesterolit is the same as saying that motor vehicles are to be blame for all road accidents . scrap the vehicles or leave only 100 in the entire us and the problem will be solved . and you have solved your problem with cholesterol by lowering it to 150.re : “ … wine is terribly destructive or even poison according to your way of thinking . ” i don ’ t know why you think that . i don ’ t remember every saying any such thing . i certainly don ’ t think it . do you have me confused with another poster ? or are you making assumptions ? sinply because wine is not in the prescription at nutritionfacts.dot , your health-nutrition encyclopedia . i was disappointed not to see your reply to my argument on the french paradox , which in point of fact is no paradox at all.ricardorichard : re : “ that “ eggs-eater ” should have been dead long ago if cholesterol were not a myth . ” this is a strawman argument . the issue under discussion is risks / probabilities . not guarantees . in other words : no one says that high cholesterol * will * give you a heart attack . it just raises your risk dramatically . similarly , no one says that smoking * will * give you cancer . it just raises the risk dramatically.everyone has heard about this or that 100 year old who smokes a pack a day every day for the last 80 years and never got cancer . so , when you smoke , you takes your changes . who knows , you may be that lucky one . similarly , there are people who eat 3 eggs a day every day for 80 years and low and behold , no heart attacks , no diabetes , etc . that ’ s great for them . but the majority of people were not so lucky … that ’ s the point.re : “ i should have been dead as well . ” i ’ m glad you are still alive to have this conversation . : - ) lucky person ! with all my best wishes , i hope your luck continues.thea , thank you for wishing me well . i am not a doctor but i have been reading a lot what clinical practice of cardiologists says and especially those who link their research with their practice and i am only repeating their argument . but those who have closed mind don ’ t want to hear that . that ’ s the point . even a probability does not enter into play , because the root problem is not cholesterol but inflammation and cholesterol only helps to patch up the hurt part of the endothelium . all the best to yuou as well.to add onto thea ’ s thorough response , this video highlights the cholesterol discrepancy here http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / when-low-risk-means-high-risk / oh yah ! i forgot about that one . there is just so much great info on this site , i can ’ t keep it all in my head . thanks for that link . if nothing else , i appreciate it . : - ) i just wanted to correct the claim that dr. greger is not familiar with the mediterranean diet and inflammation factors and their effects on heart attack risk . witness this video from 2003 or so that i think predates the nutrition facts website.https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = q7kerwdih04note that greger is actually a proponent of the idea that inflammation can be harmful as you can see from a variety of videos on this site , and his quote in the video above concerning the “ recommended diet ” vs the mediterranean diet in the post heart attack study is interesting.hello , sf-jeff . what i meant was dr greger ’ s comments on the latest study done in spain in 2012 i believe.thanks for the video . somehow it had passed me by . i like all his videos , his excellent research and his lively way of presentation except that he is prejudiced against everything which is not vegan / vegetarian ( talking about nutrition ) . he never said a pleasant word in relation to meat-eaters and even fish-eaters . they are a total disaster . he uses their achievements to correct vegan / vegetarian diet . this is not an honest and detached attitude required of a researcher.as for inflammation , he is not consequent . saturated fats are not inflammatory . they do not go rancid even in room temperature . ( it does not mean we must stuff our face with it , bnut consuming from time to time will not send you to an early grave ) . dr sinatra and the growing numbers of doctors do not reject meat . and the mediterranean diet is also meat ( not only fish and vegetables and olive oil ) although the video you advised me to watch is from 2003 but dr greger remains unyielding today . still the same blames on cholesterl , etc . see some dr sinatra ’ s videos on the topic.it is true that milk does not contain proper calcium for humans , but look , for the last 300 ? 400 ? years babies have been fed on milk . only for the last 50 yeasrs when pasteurization became a common practice – milk has lost its qualities . and it is not a scientific argument used not only by dr greger , namely that it is a strange case that only humans drink other animal ’ s milk . ( it is not true , because cats and dogs drink also cow ’ s milk , not to mention pigs ) . what ’ s wrong in drinking goat ’ s milk ? now returning to raw milk will probably put a human evolution back on the right track.take the example of the french and swiss concerning cheese . they should be dropping dead like flies because of high cholesterol and saturated fat.concerning other things , most probably already updated by dr greger , canola is a hydrogenated rape seed oil , which means it is an artificial trans fat – according to dr ribeiro . besides 400 iu of vitamin d should be updated to 4 or 5 thousand . meat-eaters don ’ t have to worry about b12 supplements because of homocysteine levels . i was surprised that he did not mention magnesium or coq10 even in 2003.i will probably refrain from commenting on the nutritional items you bring up , but i will say that it looks like we have quite a different view on evolution.some people think of evolution as a ladder , with humans at the top of the ladder . i prefer to think of evolution as a bush , with species only become more extreme in one access because of greater variability and random chance . the most successful organism on the planet by far is undoubtedly either the bacteria or viruses . they will be around long after humans are gone . we are enormously inefficient by comparison , with just a small fraction of our energies going into creating the next generation.based on this worldview i don ’ t really see any meaning in the following : “ now returning to raw milk will probably put a human evolution back on the right track . ” please read my word “ evolution ” as development . what i meant was that if we started to drink cow ’ s milk some 300 ? or 200 ? years ago , we must have accepted this development and adapted it into our evolution in a micro-scale . pasteurization upset our apple-cart for some 50 years roughly speaking ( problems with allergies , etc ) and those serious tendencies towards drinking raw milk , i called them putting a human development back on the right track , ie to resume what had been stopped . i still remember there was fresh milk widely available in europe in the 1970s and 1980s . if you left it outside a fridge , it would get sour in 48 hours in the room temperature . now it is milk + chemicals which don ’ t allow the milk to get sour and this must be the cause of allergies to milk and to dairy products.personally i have never been fond of milk or cheese , so i am not defending my preferences . but i see what happens around me . could you imagine babies not drinking cow ’ s milk in post-industrial countries even this milk full of chemicals ? if you are more into evolution , please don ’ t tell me that human being never ate meat and meat consumption is the invention of the consumer society . as far as i know , man never stopped consuming meat from other animals . and if that has any pejorative connotations ( by analogy to millk consumption ) , perhaps we should call for cannibalism – it will be healthier … do you really think that man started off with a plant diet ? so i don ’ t understand where the problem lies . according to dr brian clement cancer and cvd were little known 120 years ago . and suddenly these diseases fell on us because of meat and cholesterol ? concerning simple carbs , yes , i do agree – they contributed tremendously.suddenly meat and poultry and eggs are the culprit of our bad nutrition ? evolution only gets one vote on your entire genotype per generation . this means “ bad ” genes can stick around for thousands of generations . think of the problem we have in the voting box where we choose between 1 democrat and 1 republican times a thousand . evolution can ’ t solve lactose intolerance in a thousand years any more than we can change page 47 of the trans pacific partnership treaty in the voting booth . many of our genes are here not because they in any way help us in modern times , but rather because they helped us ( well , some of us ) survive the last ice age.i honestly don ’ t know whether meat eating was healthy 10,000 years ago , but it ’ s kind of an exaggeration to say that eating chicken , pig , or cow today is the same as eating meat 10000 years ago . here are a couple links : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / questions / where-does-the-fat-come-from-in-a-skinless-chicken-breast / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2014 / 09 / 23 / will-the-real-paleo-diet-please-stand-up / http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / does-eating-obesity-cause-obesity / if lactose intolerance is innate so far as human beings are concerned , i am not human . besides , i know a person who is now in her mid-50s and she drinks 1l of milk every day . and she has been doing that all her life and has been healthy all the time . her first visit to a dentist happened when she was … in her mid-30s ! ! ! probably she is not human either … moreover – my kids drank more or less the same amount each until they were in their late teens without any major or minor health issues , because of my stupidity – i simply did not know about a serious problem of lactose intolerance . i did not hear of sth like that in my surrounding . today i would not let them do it if they had been born again.i don ’ t argue your theoretical knowledge of evolution you have brought forward . but what are the practical results ? take the meditarreanean diet . problems start when you overeat stuffing yourself with meat every day . but if you eat two or three meat meals a week ( with lots of vegetables and flushing it with a glass or two of red wine , nothing will happen . what is wrong is that in spain / portugal they have such a meal sometimes at 11 pm or at midnight – they usually don ’ t have breakfast except for an expresso .. no wonder they still feel full when they wake up next day . and cvd and obesity is on the rise there as well but that is due to the abuse of meat and they love over-eating . “ if lactose intolerance is innate so far as human beings are concerned , i am not human . ” what point are you trying to make ? i was making the point that evolution doesn ’ t have precise control over genotypes . a lot of what we have today is just dumb luck . you sound as if i am attacking your diet with the above comments when i was doing no such thing . “ take the meditarreanean diet . problems start when you overeat stuffing yourself with meat every day . but if you eat two or three meat meals a week ( with lots of vegetables and flushing it with a glass or two of red wine , nothing will happen . ” i don ’ t see a problem with that . if you look at the links i provided above , chicken has far more fat and salt in it today than it did 100 years ago , and can potentially have higher fat levels than ice cream ( although i really should second source that claim ) , but if you eat a healthy diet , then small amounts of things that are “ bad for you ” can be good for you because of the variety and balance that they add.precicely – “ variety and balance ” your golden words . at last we are at one ! i even have a hamburger once a year . and i love it ! i did not think you were attacking me . why should i ? by the way , what is a healthy diet ? in dr greger ’ s opinion , my diet is not healthy . “ cut the middlehen ” ha ! i do love gogi berries and they would rank high on my daily berry list if not for this one fact : consuming them at the rate i need , is too low an roi – return on investment , due to the high level of mold in retail-purchased gogi berries . i have tried upwards of a dozen sources , from high-end to the top online suppliers , and none are free of visible mold . the only way i can eliminate this high dose of mold from gogi ( and other berries , nuts , and some whole roots and mushrooms ) so that i can use it in a medicine drink for example , is to put every gogi berry through my boiling water flash bath , friction , and wipe-down . this is why i am not able to utilize gogi along with the other dozen or so berries i use every day for my medicine drink made in blender with hemp or almond milk . the next time you see gogi berries in the bin at your local bulk supply store , you might want to examine them very closely . and if you switch to online suppliers for your gogi , and find one that does not pass off highly moldy gogi , please let us know ! it appears that gogi is another of the must have medicine foods we might have to put into the grow your own category ! tried 2 different brands of goji berries , but cannot digest them ( gas , stomach discomfort ) . read a great many people have the same issue with goji berries . any way around this ? i ’ ve never heard of that issue . i guess the best way to avoid any discomfort is to not eat them . plenty of other foods that contain eye-protecting nutrients. aging , blindness , cardiovascular disease , cardiovascular health , chicken , cholesterol , eggs , eye disease , eye health , fat , glaucoma , goji berries , heart disease , heart health , ldl cholesterol , lettuce , lutein , macular degeneration , nuts , organic foods , oxidative stress , phytonutrients , poultry , seeds , spinach , vegetables , vision , zeaxanthin - -

PLAIN-67	how beans help our bones health authorities from all over the world universally recommend increasing the consumption of whole grains and legumes — beans , split peas , chickpeas , and lentils — for health promotion . but what about the phytates ? phytate is a naturally occurring compound found in all plant seeds ( like beans , grains , and nuts ) that over the decades has been maligned as mineral absorption inhibitors . that ’ s why , for example , one hears advice to roast , sprout , or soak your nuts to get rid of the phytates so we can absorb more minerals , like calcium . the concern about phytates and bone health arose from a series of laboratory experiments performed on puppies published in 1949 , which suggested that high phytate diets have a bone softening and anti-calcifying effect . subsequent studies on rats , in which they fed them the equivalent of ten loaves of bread a day , “ confirmed ” phytate ’ s status as a so-called anti-nutrient . but more recently , in the light of actual human data , phytate ’ s image has undergone a makeover . a recent study published in the journal of medicinal food asked a simple question : do people who avoid high phytate foods — legumes , nuts , and whole grains — have better bone mineral density ? no . those that consumed more high-phytate foods actually had stronger bones , as measured in the heel , spine and hip . the researchers conclude that dietary phytate consumption had protective effects against osteoporosis and that low phytate consumption should actually be what ’ s considered an osteoporosis risk factor . a follow-up study , measuring phytate levels flowing through women ’ s bodies and following bone mass over time , found the same thing : women with the highest phytate levels had the lowest levels of bone loss in the spine and hip . those who ate the most phytates were also estimated to have a significantly lower risk of major fracture , and a lower risk of hip fracture specifically . this is consistent with reports that phytate can inhibit the dissolution of bone similar to anti-osteoporosis drugs like fosamax . phytates don ’ t have the side effects , though , such as osteonecrosis ( bone death ) associated with that class of drugs . people take these drugs to protect their bones , but by doing so may also risk rotting them away ( see phytates for the prevention of osteoporosis ) . eating healthy can help us avoid other drugs as well . see , for example : beans might not just help our skeleton last longer , but the rest of us as well . see increased lifespan from beans . how might one boost mineral absorption ? see new mineral absorption enhancers found . alkaline diets , animal protein , & calcium loss is another surprising video on bone health . and more on the benefits of phytates can be found in my videos : what about the high phosphorous amounts in beans , compared to calcium in beans ? can excess phosphorous in relation to calcium prevent adequate calcium uptake ? data on amino acid supplements for vegans ? harmful , harmless ? natural , un-natural ? does beans inclure soy and tofu ? dr. greger – do you need to update your “ new mineral absorption enhancers found ” info in light of the above ? that video states : “ one of those phytonutrients though , phytates , or phytic acid … can partially inhibit mineral absorption … but because it binds up some of the minerals , that just means one just have to eat more whole healthy plant foods — or eat mineral absorption enhancers ” so should we no longer be soaking our grains prior to cooking ? if phytates have been found to have a beneficial effect , it would seem that soaking grains ( in a slightly acid medium ) to reduce phytates is not something we should be doing , right ? if you eat enough legumes and grains daily , you should get some phytates in your system even if you soak and cook them . i bet it is still better not to get too much phytates , but small amounts are beneficial.ip-6 / inositol hexaphosphayte ( aka phytic acid , phytate ) was demonstrated by dr. shamsuddin and others in peer-reviewed research ( he also has two books available on amazon – see links below ) back in the late 1980 ’ s and 1990 ’ s to be a helpful aspect of human nutrition , and not an ‘ anti-nutrient ’ as it was dubbed early on . one can think of it as in one way , a powerful regulator of certain nutrients ( e.g. heme iron ) where too much can indeed be harmful to the human body , and in this sense , it is a selective nutrient ‘ regulator ’ , not ‘ anti ’ .one of the potential aspects that beans , legumes , grains , seeds , etc . , are considered healthy , and may help keep cancer at bay ( in addition to fiber ) is their content of ip6and how ip6 is converted in the body to ip3 , which helps in cellular signalling . this is particularly interesting with regards to immature cancer cells , which ‘ fail to grow up ’ to become the mature cell they were meant to be . with large doses of ip6 / inositol treatment , these cells then are responsive to this signalling and then differentiate.he also developed and advanced early-detection colon cancer screening based on his work.http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 9244360. http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 17044765 http : / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed / 14608114 ( free full text ) http : / / www.amazon.com / s / ref = nb _ sb _ noss ?

PLAIN-77	phosphate additives in chicken banned elsewhere in my video phosphate additives in meat purge and cola , i talked about the danger of phosphorus additives in food . however , when surveyed , most future medical professionals were insufficiently aware — in fact , two-thirds had no clue — of the risks related to prolonged high dietary phosphate intake . even if they knew it was a problem , they didn ’ t know which foods had added phosphates . 99 % knew that sugar was added to soda , but only 7 % knew that phosphates were added . i bet even fewer knew that it ’ s injected into most packages of meat . though this practice remains banned in europe , 11 different phosphate salts are currently allowed to be injected into meat and poultry in the united states . this despite the fact that phosphate is considered an arterial toxin — causing our arteries to stiffen up within just two hours of consumption . phosphate additives may also make poultry more dangerous from a food safety standpoint . phosphate additives may increase the number of campylobacter bacteria in chicken exudates . chicken exudate is the same as poultry purge ( colloquially known as chicken “ juice ” ) , “ the fluid that seeps out from processed poultry carcasses and is often found to be contaminated with considerable numbers of campylobacter bacteria . it is comprised of water , blood , fats , and other materials added to the poultry during processing . ” if chicken isn ’ t injected with phosphate , the exudates seeping into the package may grow about 100 campylobacter bacteria . but , add some phosphate to the carcass , and up to a hundred million bacteria may grow . why does adding phosphate to poultry increase the number of campylobacter bacteria ? it may be because phosphates increase the survival of campylobacter — by 100 fold or more . the infectious dose for campylobacter has been shown to be as little as 500 organisms . how much might there be in chicken ? 100,000 can be easily recovered from washes of whole chicken carcasses . so what does a million times more food-poisoning bacteria mean for the risk to consumers ? a mere hundred fold increase in these fecal matter bacteria can mean a thirty fold difference in the number of human outbreaks of campylobacter , which can leave patients paralyzed ( see my video poultry and paralysis ) . but , if the poultry industry doesn ’ t add phosphates , how are they ( in their words ) going to “ enhance the moisture absorbance , color , and flavor of the meat and reduce product shrinkage ? ” other concerning additives used by the meat industry include asthma-type drugs ( ractopamine in pork ) , bacteria-eating viruses ( viral meat spray ) , larvae ( maggot meat spray ) , arsenic in chicken , nitrosamines ( prevention is better than cured meat ) , and antibiotics ( drug residues in meat ) . since phosphate additives don ’ t have to be listed on the nutrition label , how do we avoid them ? all in my video how to avoid phosphate additives . aren ’ t nuts , seeds , beans etc. high in phosphorous ? we say those are good for our arteries . confused ! the phosphorous in these foods isn ’ t absorbed very well , while 100 % of phosphorous added to meats is absorbed . watching dr. greger ’ s video “ phosphate additives in meat purge and cola ” should clear up any confusion. http : / / nutritionfacts.org / video / phosphate-additives-in-meat-purge-and-cola / i love you dr michaeli ’ ll watch the video but why do i eat foods where i don ’ t absorb the nutrients . how do i decide what is enough or worse too much.nature has a way of given you what you need and holding back what you don ’ t need . the added chemicals in food is too much . they throw off homeostasis in the body . you will absorb the phosphorus you need from plant-based foods and the phosphorus you don ’ t need will not be highly bioavailable.no ! ! ! not my favorite chicken please . i ’ ll take this as a wake up call . does this mean going with organic helps ? coz , i ’ m thinking just by the looks of the food at our local grocery , it may seem fresh . but i really couldn ’ t tell which ones to consider . perhaps , sticking with the greens is better . not to mention , i have also learned from http : / / www.thehemorrhoidcurecenter.com / how good these vegetables are.andrea : re : “ i ’ ll take this as a wake up call . ” that ’ s a great idea , because this is only way in which your chicken is so bad for your health . you can learn the other ways by doing some research on this site.but , “ perhaps , sticking with the greens is better . ” no need to limit yourself so severely ! greens are part of just one of the 4 main food groups ! : fruit , veggies , grains , and legumes . the other two food groups which should be eaten in moderation ( 1-2 oz / day ) are : seeds and nuts . here are dr. greger ’ s nutrition recommendations for optimal health : http : / / nutritionfacts.org / 2011 / 09 / 12 / dr-gregers-2011-optimum-nutrition-recommendations / note the lack of any meat , dairy and eggs – regardless of whether or not the products are organic . you can learn all the reasons why on this site . it really is an eye opener . i hope you are able to use this information to start eating healthy . you will find that you can eat lots of really great yummy foods . let me know if you would like some practical advice on how to get started.hi thea . thank goodness you ’ re not taking eggs away from me . i have started having enough green , eggs , lean pork , and bananas . so far , my body has been doing better . i feel so much better now.andrea : i have no interest in taking any food away from anyone . but it seems like there is a misunderstanding . so , just to clarify was i was explaining to you : i was strongly recommending that you remove all meat , dairy and eggs from your diet in order to maximize your health probabilities . eggs are especially bad , as you can see in the videos and articles on this site.anyway , i ’ m glad you are feeling better . good luck.interesting read . are there any official documents that confirm phosphates are banned in europe or other countries ?

PLAIN-90	how to boost the benefits of exercise we all know exercise is beneficial to our health . then why is it that ultramarathon runners may generate so many free radicals during a race that they can damage the dna of a significant percentage of their cells ? researchers have looked at the exercise-induced increase in free radical production as a paradox : why would an apparently healthy act — exercise — lead to detrimental effects through damage to various molecules and tissues ? this arises out of somewhat of a misunderstanding : exercise in and of itself is not necessarily the healthy act — it ’ s the recovery after exercise that is so healthy , the whole “ that-which-doesn ’ t-kill-us-makes-us-stronger ” notion . for example , exercise training has been shown to enhance antioxidant defenses by increasing the activities of our antioxidant enzymes . so , during the race ultra-marathoners may be taking hits to their dna , but a week later they can experience great benefits , as shown in my video , enhanced athletic recovery without undermining adaptation . in a recent study , researchers from oregon state university looked at the level of dna damage in athletes . six days after a race , athletes didn ’ t just go back to the baseline level of dna damage , but had significantly less , presumably because they had revved up their antioxidant defenses . so , maybe exercise-induced oxidative damage is beneficial , similar to vaccination . by freaking out the body a little , we might induce a response that ’ s favorable in the long run . this concept , that low levels of a damaging entity can up-regulate protective mechanisms , is known as hormesis . for example , herbicides kill plants , but in tiny doses may actually boost plant growth , presumably by stressing the plant into rallying its resources to successfully fight back . wait a second , though . could eating anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant rich plant foods undermine this adaptation response ? we know that berries may reduce inflammatory muscle damage ( see reducing muscle soreness with berries ) , and greens may reduce free radical dna damage ( see preventing exercise induced oxidative stress with watercress ) . dark chocolate and tomato juice appear to have similar effects . how it works is that flavonoid phytonutrients in fruits , vegetables , and beans seem to inhibit the activity of xanthine oxidase , considered the main contributor of free radicals during exercise . and the carbs in plant foods may also decrease stress hormone levels . so in 1999 , a theoretical concern was raised . maybe all that free radical stress from exercise is a good thing , and increased consumption of some antioxidant nutrients might interfere with these necessary adaptive processes . if we decrease free radical tissue damage , maybe we won ’ t get that increase in activity of those antioxidant enzymes . a group of researchers who performed a study on tart cherry juice and recovery following a marathon responded to this antioxidant concern by suggesting that , although it is likely that muscle damage , inflammation , and oxidative stress are important factors in the adaptation process , minimizing these factors may improve recovery so we can train more and perform better . so , there are theories on both sides , but what happens when we actually put it to the test ? while antioxidant or anti-inflammatory supplements may prevent these adaptive events , researchers found that blackcurrant extract – although packed with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties – actually boosted the health benefits of regular exercise . if we take antioxidant pills — vitamin c and vitamin e supplements — we can also reduce the stress levels induced by exercise , but in doing so we block that boost in antioxidant enzyme activity caused by exercise . now maybe we don ’ t need that boost if we don ’ t have as much damage , but vitamin c supplements seem to impair physical performance in the first place . with plant foods , though , we appear to get the best of both worlds . for example , lemon verbena , an antioxidant-rich herbal tea , protects against oxidative damage and decreases the signs of muscular damage and inflammation , without blocking the cellular adaptation to exercise . in a recent study , researchers showed that lemon verbena does not affect the increase of the antioxidant enzyme response promoted by exercise . on the contrary : antioxidant enzyme activity was even higher in the lemon verbena group . in my video , enhanced athletic recovery without undermining adaptation , you can see the level of antioxidant enzyme activity before and after 21 days of intense running exercises in the control group . with all that free radical damage , the body started cranking up its antioxidant defenses . but give a dark green leafy tea , and not only do we put a kabosh on the damage due to all the phytonutrients and antioxidants , but we still get the boost in defenses — in fact , in this case , the boost was even greater . find out more on enhancing athletic recovery in this three-part video series : 1 . reducing muscle fatigue with citrus 2 . reducing muscle soreness with berries 3 . preventing exercise-induced oxidative stress with watercress i ’ m curious if this might be more a question of dose than source . so far as i know , the studies which have shown a negative effect from vitamin c supplementation have all used 1000 mg , or well above the rda . you ’ d be hard pressed to eat anywhere near that , of course , but if you did , might the results be the same ? i think it ’ s possible , at least , considering studies with 100-200 mg of supplemental vitamin c haven ’ t shown any detrimental effects . as ever , too much is as bad as too little . the dose makes both the poison and medicine.another study to this same point : enhanced immune system , and decreased oxidative stress with increased fruit and veggie consumption : http : / / jn.nutrition.org / content / 137 / 12 / 2737.full.pdf + htmlexcellent review ! man i love this stuff.or it could be plant is toxic in itself so it become hoemesis substance by itself like exercise.probably my favorite series of subjects on the website . demonstrates the absolute perfection of using natural foods as they are , and sticking with whole food plants.a recent study at , i believe the university of tx , suggested that aerobic exercise improves health by increasing autophagy . i ’ m guessing this might be a prime factor in helping to clean up the damaged dna . adding the phytonutrients i would suppose reduces the damage to begin with.it ’ s much easier to run my 6 miles when i know what good it ’ s doing me . just had my watermelon so gotta do my run.i found this article confusing . so , do we take the dark green leafy tea right after exercising ? what type of tea ? i appreciate all the background , but would love a succinct course of action provided at the end that i can skip to when some of the material is beyond my brain capacity or i ’ m short on time . thank you ! yes ! i was waiting for that too . isn ’ t that why we read the “ experts ” anyway ? succinct truths are my quest : ) i have found that just being a vegan made recovery from exercise much better . then when i adopted the raw ’ til 4 diet , my recovery went through the roof ! i am 55 and i am so amazed at the things my body will now tolerate in terms of being able to do new activities and not suffer the stiff muscles the next day . i have not gone to a gym and done any body building mind you , but i have done plenty of other stuff . i love it ! on a related topic i heard about this concept of metabolic efficiency recently for endurance athletes like marathons and beyond . the idea was to encourage the use of fat as fuel rather than glycogen so that glycogen stores would last longer during running / cycling , reducing the need for topping up with so much “ sugar ” during the exercise . the argument was don ’ t carbohydrate load pre-race . carbohydrate produces a spike in sugar in blood , brings insulin , which stops fat burning . go for protein first like yoghurt and fruit for 2 hours before a big event rather than a bowl of porridge . it was also stated that after a couple of weeks of eating like this you could have an 80 % increase in fat burning as opposed to glycogen burning and long slow runs provided the other 20 % potential improvement . i was interested in this topic as a way of improving my performance , reducing tiredness in later stages of say a marathon , but this talk was predicated on eating animal products . i am a vegan so essentially live on complex carbohydrates fruit and veggies ( and as we know there is plenty of protein ) . i wondered what dr greger thought of this metabolic efficiency idea in terms of fat burning and if there has been work done on it in relation to vegans ? yes , i agree that many of the videos are great , but i am left with not knowing exactly what i should or should not do based on the studies . please give us clear directions .. ex . “ so when you exercise , make sure you do abc and def to minimize the oxidative stress ” . thank you. antioxidants , beans , berries , beverages , cherries , chocolate , currants , dna damage , exercise , flavonoids , fruit , fruit juice , greens , herbal tea , hormesis , inflammation , juice , lemon verbena , muscle health , muscle inflammation , oxidative stress , plant-based diets , supplements , tea , tomato juice , tomatoes , vegans , vegetables , vegetarians , vitamin c , vitamin e - -

PLAIN-945	colon health because of the fiber content , plant-based diets may produce healthier stools and lead to larger bowel movements , which is important for the prevention of a number of medical conditions . interestingly , antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables appear to increase stool size independent of fiber . furthermore , plant-based diets may facilitate healthy gut flora ( which may positively contribute to weight loss ) . this includes most plant foods such as dragon fruit — even nuts , seeds , and popcorn , which apparently lower diverticulitis risk .. a plant-based diet may be helpful in both the prevention and treatment of colon cancer . the fiber in whole plant foods allows the body to excrete excess estrogen , which may help prevent breast cancer . intestinal transit time — how long it takes food to get from one end to the other — may be one of the determinants of cancer risk . particularly protective foods include berries ( especially organic strawberries ) , flax , broccoli ( see also here ) , amla ( indian gooseberries ) , black beans , coffee , a few herbal varieties of tea , carob , and apples.on the other hand , total meat consumption has been associated with higher rates of colon cancer , in particular cooked muscle tissueand processed meat . meat contains the pro-inflammatory compound arachidonic acid and may also be contaminated the toxic megacolon superbug c. diff and potentially cancer-causing wart viruses . cheese containing cheese skipper larvae ( a type of maggot ) may cause colon infections and certain types of fish may cause greasy orange rectal leakage . finally , gluten , while healthy for most people , needs to be eliminated from the diets of those with celiac disease . folic acid in pill form could be harmful as well . - vegetarians , fiber , vegetables , fruit , plant-based diets , vegans , animal protein , colon disease , standard american diet , rectal cancer , processed foods , gut flora , cancer , meat , colon cancer - -
